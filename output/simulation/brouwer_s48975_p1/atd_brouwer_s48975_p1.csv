57,56,"Cognitive reactivity, dysfunctional attitudes, and depressive relapse and recurrence in cognitive therapy responders.","Jarrett, Robin B.; Minhajuddin, Abu; Borman, Patricia D.; Dunlap, Lauren; Segal, Zindel V.; Kidner, Cindy L.; Friedman, Edward S.; Thase, Michael E.","Dysfunctional attitudes can foreshadow depressive relapse/recurrence. Priming mood, through induction paradigms, is hypothesized to activate dysfunctional attitudes. Cognitive reactivity (CR) refers to mood-linked increases in dysfunctional attitudes after priming. Here we explored the extent to which CR as well as residual, unprimed, dysfunctional attitudes predicted depressive relapse/recurrence among depressed patients who responded to acute phase cognitive therapy (CT). Consenting adults, aged 18-70, with recurrent major depressive disorder (n = 523) participated in a two-site randomized controlled trial examining the durability of continuation phase treatments. Patients received 16-20 sessions of CT. Among the 245 incompletely remitted responders, 213 agreed to undergo a mood induction paradigm. After 8 months of continuation phase treatments, participants were followed an additional 24 months. Although the mood induction significantly lowered mood in 80 \% of responders, the expected CR was not evident. By contrast, higher unprimed dysfunctional attitudes following CT did predict relapse/recurrence over 20 and 32 months post-randomization. The findings of this large longitudinal study of incompletely remitted CT responders challenge the notion that it is necessary to prime mood in order to maximize dysfunctional attitudes' prediction of relapse and/or recurrence. While findings cannot be generalized beyond CT responders, they emphasize the clinical importance of reducing dysfunctional attitudes in preventing depression.",2012.0,10.1016/j.brat.2012.01.008,ML6MVTAB,1,cognitive,50.0
35,34,Metacognitive awareness and prevention of relapse in depression: empirical evidence.,"Teasdale, John D.; Moore, Richard G.; Hayhurst, Hazel; Pope, Marie; Williams, Susan; Segal, Zindel V.","Metacognitive awareness is a cognitive set in which negative thoughts/feelings are experienced as mental events, rather than as the self. The authors hypothesized that (a) reduced metacognitive awareness would be associated with vulnerability to depression and (b) cognitive therapy (CT) and mindfulness-based CT (MBCT) would reduce depressive relapse by increasing metacognitive awareness. They found (a) accessibility of metacognitive sets to depressive cues was less in a vulnerable group (residually depressed patients) than in nondepressed controls; (b) accessibility of metacognitive sets predicted relapse in residually depressed patients; (c) where CT reduced relapse in residually depressed patients, it increased accessibility of metacognitive sets; and (d) where MBCT reduced relapse in recovered depressed patients, it increased accessibility of metacognitive sets.

4,3,How does cognitive therapy prevent relapse in residual depression? Evidence from a controlled trial.,"Teasdale, John D.; Scott, Jan; Moore, Richard G.; Hayhurst, Hazel; Pope, Marie; http://orcid.org/Scott","This study examined the cognitive mediation of relapse prevention by cognitive therapy (CT) in a trial of 158 patients with residual depression. Scores based on agreement with item content of 5 questionnaires of depression-related cognition provided no evidence for cognitive mediation. A measure of the form of response to those questionnaires, the number of times patients used extreme response categories ( totally agree and totally disagree ), showed significant and substantial prediction of relapse, differential response to CT, and conformity to mediational criteria. CT reduced relapse through reductions in absolutist, dichotomous thinking style. CT may prevent relapse by training patients to change the way that they process depression-related material rather than by changing belief in depressive thought content.

41,40,Improved cognitive content endures for 2 years among unstable responders to acute-phase cognitive therapy for recurrent major depressive disorder.,"Vittengl, J. R.; Clark, L. A.; Thase, M. E.; Jarrett, R. B.","BACKGROUND: The cognitive model of depression suggests that cognitive therapy (CT) improves major depressive disorder (MDD) in part by changing depressive cognitive content (e.g. dysfunctional attitudes, hopelessness). The current analyses clarified: (1) the durability of improvements in cognitive content made by acute-phase CT responders; (2) whether continuation-phase CT (C-CT) or fluoxetine (FLX) further improves cognitive content; and (3) the extent to which cognitive content mediates continuation treatments' effects on depressive symptoms and major depressive relapse/recurrence. METHOD: Out-patients with recurrent MDD who responded to acute-phase CT (n = 241) were randomized to 8 months of C-CT, FLX or pill placebo (PBO) and followed for an 24 additional months. Cognitive content was assessed approximately every 4 months using five standard patient-report measures. RESULTS: Large improvements in cognitive content made during acute-phase CT were maintained for 32 months, with 78-90 \% of patients scoring in normal ranges, on average. Cognitive content varied little between C-CT, FLX and PBO arms, overall. Small, transient improvements in cognitive content in C-CT or FLX compared with PBO patients did not clearly mediate the treatments' effects on depressive symptoms or on major depressive relapse/recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Outpatients with recurrent MDD who respond to acute-phase CT show durable improvements in cognitive content. C-CT or FLX may not continue to improve patient-reported cognitive content substantively, and thus may treat recurrent MDD by other paths.",2015.0,10.1017/S0033291715001191,VIPWWVAK,1,cognitive,77.0
49,48,Differential cognitive response to a mood challenge following successful cognitive therapy or pharmacotherapy for unipolar depression.,"Segal, Zindel V.; Gemar, Michael; Williams, Susan","This study examined the nature of cognitive reactivity to mood changes in formerly depressed patients. Patients who recovered either through cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT; N = 25) or through pharmacotherapy (PT; N = 29) completed self-reported ratings of dysfunctional attitudes before and after a a negative mood induction procedure. In response to similar levels of induced sad mood, PT patients showed a significant increase in dysfunctional cognitions compared with patients in the CBT group. To evaluate the effects of such cognitive reactivity on the subsequent course of depression, follow-up analyses reassessed 30 patients several years after initial testing. Results indicated that patients' reactions to the mood induction procedure were predictive of depressive relapse. These findings argue for differential effects of treatment on cognitive reactivity to mood induction and for the link between such reactivity and risk for later depressive relapse.

46,45,Predictors of Depressive Relapse During a Two Year Prospective Follow-up after Cognitive and Behavioral Therapies.,"Gollan, Jackie K.; Gortner, Eric T.; Dobson, Keith S.","Patient characteristics may partly explain individual differences in long-term maintenance of treatment gains in response to cognitive and behavioral therapies (CBT). This study evaluated the relative contribution of negative cognitive style, behavioral activation, and personality patterns, measured at the end of treatment among treatment responders, towards the risk of relapse of major depressive disorder over a 2-year prospective follow-up. The sample included depressed adults who were randomized and received an adequate dose of one of three forms of CBT, who then fully responded and completed a 2-year prospective follow-up (N = 93) (Jacobson et al., 1996; Gortner, Gollan, Dobson and Jacobson, 1998). Cox regression analyses revealed that for treatment responders, self-devaluative depressogenic cognitive style did not predict relapse during the 2-year follow-up. Separate cox regression analyses indicated that without considering the contribution of personality patterns, it was important to distinguish the level of behavioral activation (e.g. frequency of pleasant events) from its associated pleasure in predicting relapse. With the introduction of personality patterns; however, an integrated model revealed that only dependent personality pattern was associated with hazard of relapse during the 2-year prospective follow-up. Dependent personality pattern may increase relapse through behavioral passivity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",,,CLRX7Z9K,1,behavior,123.0
55,54,Dysfunctional attitudes or extreme response style as predictors of depressive relapse and recurrence after mobile cognitive therapy for recurrent depression,"Brouwer, Marlies E.; Williams, Alishia D.; Forand, Nicholas R.; DeRubeis, Robert J.; Bockting, Claudi L. H.","Background: According to previous research, dysfunctional attitudes and/or scoring extreme on the end-point anchors of questionnaires of dysfunctional thinking predict depressive relapse/recurrence. Evidence that these two methods represent a risk for depressive relapse/recurrence is however mixed, due to differential or poorly defined concepts. The current study aimed to test the two methods. Methods: Remitted recurrently depressed patients with low residual depressive symptoms (N = 264) were recruited as part of a randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of mobile Cognitive Therapy for recurrent depression versus treatment as usual. In the current secondary analysis, Cox regression models were conducted to test dysfunctional attitudes and extreme responding variables (assessed on the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale [DAS]) as predictors of depressive relapse/recurrence within two years after randomization. Results: Data from 255 participants were analyzed. Results showed that DAS total scores at baseline significantly predicted depressive relapse/recurrence (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 1.01, p = .042). An index that reflects endorsement of habitual relative to functional responses was a significant predictor of depressive relapse/recurrence (HR = 2.11, p = .029). Limitations: The current study employed a single measure to identify extreme responses and dysfunctional attitudes. Secondly, various statistical analyses were performed without correcting for multiple testing, which in turn increased the likelihood to finding significant results. Conclusions: Current study confirmed both methods: People who scored higher on the DAS or had relatively more habitual than functional responses on the extreme positive ends of the DAS had a decreased time to depressive relapse/recurrence.

23,22,Extreme response style and symptom return after depression treatment: The role of positive extreme responding.,"Forand, Nicholas R.; DeRubeis, Robert J.","Objective: Evidence linking extreme response style (ER) to depressive relapse has been mixed. One reason might be high levels of extreme responses that are positive in nature (ER-Ps) compared with those negative in nature (ER-Ns) at posttreatment. ER-Ps likely consist of both maladaptive style responses and adaptive content responses (i.e., legitimate denials of dysfunction). The composition of ER-Ps might confound measures of total extreme responding as well as conventional scores on cognitive questionnaires. In the current study, we assessed ER in a new sample by (a) disambiguating ER-Ps that reflect style from those that reflect content and (b) assessing the contribution of ER-Ps to the prediction of relapse/recurrence. Method: Responders (N = 104) to a randomized controlled trial of cognitive therapy versus medications for moderate to severe depression had an average age of 40 years (SD = 12), and they were 58 \% female, 38 \% married/cohabitating, and 85 \% Caucasian. ER variables were calculated using the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale (DAS; Weissman, 1979), with ER-Ps categorized as either content or style responses. ER indices and DAS scores were used to predict symptom return over 2 years. Results: No standard extreme responding variables (e.g., an index of total extreme responding) predicted symptom return, but higher relative levels of style ER-P predicted relapse/recurrence. Total DAS scores also predicted relapse/recurrence but only when high levels of style ER-P responses were controlled. Conclusions: ER-Ps, at least on the DAS, appear to contain indicators of both adaptive and maladaptive positive responses. Future research should attend to the valence of the extreme responses as well as to the content of extreme positive responses, which may reflect either healthy or unhealthy tendencies.

21,20,Investigating associations between cortisol and cognitive reactivity to sad mood provocation and the prediction of relapse in remitted major depression.,"Chopra, K. K.; Segal, Z. V.; Buis, T.; Kennedy, S. H.; Levitan, R. D.","Overview: In remitted depressed patients, an increase in dysfunctional thoughts following a sad mood induction can predict relapse over 18 months. The current analysis examined whether salivary cortisol levels could also predict relapse in these same individuals. Method: 99 subjects with major depression were first treated to full remission using either antidepressant medication or cognitive behavioural therapy. While in the remitted state, subjects were exposed to sad music to trigger dysfunctional thoughts. In a subset of 55 subjects, salivary cortisol levels taken before and after the mood challenge were also obtained. Results: Unexpectedly, cortisol levels tended to decrease rather than increase following the mood challenge, suggesting that anticipation of the mood challenge was more stressful than the challenge itself. We thus used pre-challenge cortisol levels as the main grouping variable. Based on Kaplan-Meier survival curves, among subjects with low pre-challenge cortisol levels, those with a history of three or more prior episodes had significantly higher rates of relapse than did subjects with two or less prior episodes. In subjects with high pre-challenge cortisol levels, there was no significant difference in rates of relapse based on the number of prior episodes. Conclusion: In depressed patients with few prior episodes, assessing risk of relapse and thus establishing the duration for treatment can be a difficult clinical problem. Pending replication, the current results suggest that high anticipatory cortisol levels may have utility in predicting relapse even in patients with few prior episodes.

V.","Objective: Both Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Cognitive Therapy (CT) enhance self‐management of prodromal symptoms associated with depressive relapse, albeit through divergent therapeutic procedures. We evaluated rates of relapse in remitted depressed patients receiving MBCT and CT. Decentering and dysfunctional attitudes were assessed as treatment‐specific process markers. Method: Participants in remission from Major Depressive Disorder (MDD; N = 166) were randomized to 8 weeks of either MBCT (N = 82) or CT (N = 84) and were followed for 24 months, with process markers measured every 3 months. Attendance in both treatments was high (6.3/8 session) and treatment fidelity and competence were evaluated. Relapse was defined as a return of symptoms meeting the criteria for major depression on Module A of the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (SCID). Results: Intention‐to‐treat analyses indicated no differences between MBCT and CT in either rates of relapse to MDD or time to relapse across 24 months of follow up. Both groups experienced significant increases in decentering and participants in CT reported greater reductions in dysfunctional attitudes. Within both treatments, participants who relapsed evidenced lower decentering scores than those who stayed well over the follow up. Conclusions: This is the first study to directly compare relapse prophylaxis following MBCT and CT directly. The lack of group differences in time to relapse supports the view that both interventions are equally effective and that increases in decentering achieved via either treatment are associated with greater protection. These findings lend credence to Teasdale et al.'s (2002) contention that, even though they may be taught through dissimilar methods, CT and MBCT help participants develop similar metacognitive skills for the regulation of distressing thoughts and emotions.

25,24,Differential predictors of response to preventive cognitive therapy in recurrent depression: a 2-year prospective study.,"Bockting, Claudi L. H.; Spinhoven, Philip; Koeter, Maarten W. J.; Wouters, Luuk F.; Visser, Ieke; Schene, Aart H.","BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder is a recurrent disease. Brief cognitive therapy (CT), added to either regular care or medication, is helpful in preventing relapse/recurrence. Little is known which type of persons benefit from preventive CT, the so called 'aptitude treatment interaction' effect. METHOD: The present cohort included exclusively patients with at least two previous episodes remitted on various types of treatments (n = 172). They were assessed within a clinical trial comparing treatment as usual (TAU) with preventive CT added to TAU. Differential demographic, illness-related, psychological and biological risk factors in postponing recurrence by preventive CT were examined. RESULTS: Significant aptitude-treatment-interaction effects were found for the number of previous episodes, daily hassles and life events, avoidant coping, gender, and morning cortisol levels. Preventive CT seemed ineffective in patients with life events (as more frequently reported by women in our study) and in patients with high episode number characterized by higher levels of avoidant coping. Generic predictors indicate that in CT, as in TAU, patients with more residual depressive symptomatology and higher levels of dysfunctional attitudes profit less from preventive CT. CONCLUSION: The finding that preventive CT protects against the influence of a consistently found risk factor of relapse/recurrence, i.e. the number of depressive episodes, underlines the potential of psychological preventive interventions. Preventive CT seemed to be especially effective in reducing presumably internally provoked, relapse/recurrence but may be quite ineffective in reducing externally provoked relapse/recurrence. CT possibly prevents either stress generation or disrupts kindling effects. Kindling effects probably cannot be disrupted in patients with higher levels of avoidant coping who experienced a high number of episodes, and patients who experienced life events.",2006.0,10.1159/000092893,XLUBYWNU,1,cognitive,211.0
30,29,Initial Steps to inform selection of continuation cognitive therapy or fluoxetine for higher risk responders to cognitive therapy for recurrent major depressive disorder,"Vittengl, J. R.; Anna Clark, L.; Thase, M. E.; Jarrett, R. B.","Responders to acute‐phase cognitive therapy (A‐CT) for major depressive disorder (MDD) often relapse or recur, but continuation‐phase cognitive therapy (C‐CT) or fluoxetine reduces risks for some patients. We tested composite moderators of C‐CT versus fluoxetine's preventive effects to inform continuation treatment selection. Responders to A‐CT for MDD judged to be at higher risk for relapse due to unstable or partial remission (N=172) were randomized to 8 months of C‐CT or fluoxetine with clinical management and assessed, free from protocol treatment, for 24 additional months. Pre‐continuation‐treatment characteristics that in survival analyses moderated treatments' effects on relapse over 8 months of continuation‐phase treatment (residual symptoms and negative temperament) and on relapse/recurrence over the full observation period's 32 months (residual symptoms and age) were combined to estimate the potential advantage of C‐CT versus fluoxetine for individual patients. Assigning patients to optimal continuation treatment (i.e., to C‐CT or fluoxetine, depending on patients' pre‐continuation‐treatment characteristics) resulted in absolute reduction of relapse or recurrence risk by 16‐21% compared to the other non‐optimal treatment. Although these novel results require replication before clinical application, selecting optimal continuation treatment (i.e., personalizing treatment) for higher risk A‐CT responders may decrease risks of MDD relapse and recurrence substantively.",2017.0,10.1016/j.psychres.2017.03.032,ESDSJLZY,1,additional,224.0

We clarified which CT responders experience remission, recovery, relapse, and recurrence by testing baseline demographic, clinical, and personality variables. The sample of CT responders at higher risk of relapse (N = 241) was randomized to 8 months of continuation-phase CT, double-blinded fluoxetine, or pill placebo, and followed 24 months (Jarrett \& Thase, 2010). Patients with lower positive emotionality and behavioral activation at the end of acute-phase CT showed increased risk for relapse/recurrence of MDD. In addition, patients with lower positive emotionality and behavioral activation, as well as higher residual depression (including emotional, cognitive, and social facets), showed decreased probability of remission (≥6 continuous weeks of minimal or absent symptoms) after acute-phase CT. Finally, patients with greater residual depression, as well as younger age and earlier MDD onset, showed decreased probability of recovery (≥35 continuous weeks of minimal or absent symptoms) after acute-phase CT. Moderator analyses did not reveal differential prediction across the continuation phase treatment arms. These results may help clinicians gauge the prognoses and need for continuation treatment among MDD patients who respond to acute-phase CT.",2015.0,,THUUWIKJ,1,behavior,233.0
33,32,Cognitive Reactivity to Sad Mood Provocation and the Prediction of Depressive Relapse.,"Segal, Zindel V.; Kennedy, Sidney; Gemar, Michael; Hood, Karyn; Pedersen, Rebecca; Buis, Tom","Context: Episode remission in unipolar major depression, while distinguished by minimal symptom burden, can also be a period of marked sensitivity to emotional stress as well as an increased risk of relapse. Objective: To examine whether mood-linked changes in dysfunctional thinking predict relapse in recovered patients who were depressed. Design: In phase 1 of this study, patients with major depressive disorder were randomly assigned to receive either antidepressant medication or cognitive behavior therapy. In phase 2, patients who achieved clinical remission underwent sad mood provocation and were then observed with regular clinical assessments for 18 months. Setting: Outpatient psychiatric clinics at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Ontario. Participants: A total of 301 outpatients with major depressive disorder, aged 18 to 65 years, participated in phase 1 of this study and 99 outpatients with major depressive disorder in remission, aged 18 to 65 years, participated in phase 2. Main Outcome Measure: Occurrence of a relapse meeting DSM-IV criteria for a major depressive episode as assessed by the longitudinal interval follow-up evaluation and a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score of 16 or greater. Results: Patients who recovered through antidepressant medication showed greater cognitive reactivity following the mood provocation than those who received cognitive behavior therapy. Regardless of type of prior treatment, the magnitude of mood-linked cognitive reactivity was a significant predictor of relapse over the subsequent 18 months. Patients whose mood-linked endorsement of dysfunctional attitudes increased by a minimum of 8 points had a significantly shorter time to relapse than those whose scores were not as elevated. Conclusions: The vulnerability of remitted depressed patients for illness relapse may be related to the (re)activation of depressive thinking styles triggered by temporary dysphoric states. This is the first study to link such differences to prognosis following successful treatment for depression. Further understanding of factors predisposing to relapse/recurrence in recovered patients may help to shorten the potentially lifelong course of depression.

S.","Background: To investigate whether usage of treatment-acquired regulatory skills is associated with prevention of depressive relapse/recurrence. Method: Remitted depressed outpatients entered a 24-month clinical follow up after either 8 weekly group sessions of cognitive therapy (CT; N = 84) or mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT; N = 82). The primary outcome was symptom return meeting the criteria for major depression on Module A of the SCID. Results: Factor analysis identified three latent factors (53% of the variance): decentering (DC), distress tolerance (DT), and residual symptoms (RS), which were equivalent across CT and MBCT. Latent change score modeling of factor slopes over the follow up revealed positive slopes for DC (beta = .177), and for DT (beta = .259), but not for RS (beta = -.017), indicating posttreatment growth in DC and DT, but no change in RS. Cox regression indicated that DC slope was a significant predictor of relapse/recurrence prophylaxis, Hazard Ratio (HR) = .232 90% Confidence Interval (CI) [.067, .806], controlling for past depressive episodes, treatment group, and medication. The practice of therapy-acquired regulatory skills had no direct effect on relapse/recurrence (beta = .028) but predicted relapse/recurrence through an indirect path (beta = -.125), such that greater practice of regulatory skills following treatment promoted increases in DC (beta = .462), which, in turn, predicted a reduced risk of relapse/recurrence over 24 months (beta = -.270). Conclusions: Preventing major depressive disorder relapse/recurrence may depend upon developing DC in addition to managing residual symptoms.

Among patients who responded to treatment, both CT coping skills and in-session evidence of the independent implementation of CT material predicted lower risk for relapse in the year following treatment. These relationships were not accounted for by either symptom severity at the end of treatment or symptom change from pre- to posttreatment. Self-esteem, assessed at posttreatment, failed to predict risk for relapse in the year following treatment.

47,46,Cognitive reactivity versus dysfunctional cognitions and the prediction of relapse in recurrent major depressive disorder.,"Figueroa, Caroline A.; Ruhe, Henricus G.; Koeter, Maarten W.; Spinhoven, Philip and","OBJECTIVE: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a burdensome disease that has a high risk of relapse/recurrence. Cognitive reactivity appears to be a risk factor for relapse. It remains unclear, however, whether dysfunctional cognitions alone or the reactivity of such cognitions to mild states of sadness (ie, cognitive reactivity) is the crucial factor that increases relapse risk. We aimed to assess the long-term predictive value of cognitive reactivity versus dysfunctional cognitions and other risk factors for depressive relapse. METHOD: In a prospective cohort of outpatients (N = 116; studied between 2000-2005) who had experienced \textgreater /= 2 previous major depressive episodes (MDEs) and were in remission (DSM-IV) at the start of follow-up, we measured cognitive reactivity, with the Leiden Index of Depression Sensitivity (LEIDS), and dysfunctional cognitions, with the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale, simultaneously. Course of illness (with the primary outcome of MDE assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders Patient Edition) and time to relapse were monitored prospectively for 3.5 years. RESULTS: Cognitive reactivity scores were associated with time to relapse over the 3.5-year follow-up and also when corrected for the number of previous MDEs and concurrent depressive symptoms (hazard ratio for 1 standard deviation [(HR(SD)); 20 points of the LEIDS, measuring cognitive reactivity] = 1.47; 95 \% CI, 1.04-2.09; P = .031). Rumination appeared to be a particularly strong predictor of relapse (HR(SD) = 1.60; 95 \% CI, 1.13-2.26; P = .007). Dysfunctional cognitions did not predict relapse over 3.5 years (HR(SD) = 1.00; 95 \% CI, 0.74-1.37; P = .93). Every 20-point increase on the cognitive reactivity scale resulted in a 10 \% to 15 \% increase in risk of relapse (corrected for previous MDEs and concurrent depressive symptoms). CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive reactivity--and particularly rumination--is a long-term predictor of relapse. Future research should address whether psychological interventions can improve cognitive reactivity scores and thereby prevent depressive relapses.

Identifying predictors of recurrence and their relative importance in patients with recurrent depression is important for a better understanding of the course of this disease. This type of knowledge can be used to optimize and tailor preventive strategies of recurrence. In this study, we examined predictors of recurrence over a 5.5-year follow-up period and quantified to which extent these predictors explained observed variation in recurrence. METHOD: Data from 172 remitted recurrently depressed patients over a 5.5-year follow-up period were used. Recurrence was assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Illness-, stress-, and coping-related factors were examined as predictors of recurrence. Multiple Cox regression analysis was used, and explained variation was assessed to quantify the relative importance of the predictors. Patients were recruited between February 2000 and September 2000. RESULTS: Number of previous episodes and residual symptoms explained each 15 \% of the variation in recurrence, indicating a medium effect size. The final multivariate prediction model included: a higher number of previous episodes, more residual symptoms, and lower levels of positive refocusing (explained variation 29 \% , indicating a strong effect size). CONCLUSION: In our multivariate prediction model, the number of previous episodes, residual symptoms, and a specific coping style were predictors of recurrence over a 5.5-year follow-up period in remitted recurrently depressed patients. Preventive therapies should focus on these factors. Although a substantial part of variation in recurrence (29 \% ) was explained by these predictors, most of it remains unexplained. Consequently, recurrence remains a difficult to predict and only partially understood phenomenon.

The purpose of this study was to identify factors predictive of recurrence and to examine whether previous depressive episodes influence vulnerability for subsequent depression in a sample of remitted recurrently depressed patients. METHOD: Recurrence was examined prospectively using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders in 172 euthymic patients with recurrent depression (DSM-IV) recruited from February 2000 through September 2000. Illness-related characteristics, coping, and stress (life events and daily hassles) were examined as predictors. RESULTS: Risk factors for recurrence were a high number of previous episodes, more residual depressive symptomatology and psychopathology, and more daily hassles. Factors with both an increasing and decreasing pathogenic effect with increasing episode number were detected. CONCLUSION: We found some support for dynamic vulnerability models that posit a change of vulnerability with consecutive episodes. Preventive interventions should be considered in patients with multiple recurrences, focusing on residual symptomatology and specific coping styles.",2006.0,,XNH9A4ET,1,cognitive,436.0

Identifying predictors of recurrence of MDD among young samples is therefore of paramount clinical importance. Survival analytic models were used to evaluate the effects of dysfunctional cognitions and Axis II personality pathology on MDD recurrence in a sample of 130 previously, but not currently, depressed young adults. Participants were initially assessed for depression, dysfunctional attitudes, and personality pathology during their first semester in college and then reevaluated via the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation interview every 6 months for 18 months. Baseline level of depressive symptoms significantly (HR-1.07, p = .002) predicted recurrence of MDD. In the survival analyses with baseline level of depression serving as a current mood state covariate, overall personality pathology (HR-1.04, p \textless .05), but not cognitive distortions, uniquely predicted MDD recurrence. In similar analyses, none of the specific DSM-IV personality disorder cluster scores uniquely predicted recurrence.

In the current study we examined whether negatively biased self-referential processing, negative life events, baseline depressive symptoms, and psychotropic medication use predicted the onset of a subsequent depressive episode in a longitudinal study of women with a history of recurrent MDD. Higher levels of depressive symptoms at baseline predicted experiencing a greater number of negative life events, which, in turn, tended to predict recurrence of depression. It is important that after accounting for other associations, negatively biased self-referential processing contributed unique variance to the likelihood of experiencing a depressive episode over the next 3 years. Thus, negatively biased self-referential processing appears to be a significant risk factor for the recurrence of depressive episodes and may be an important target for interventions aimed at preventing future episodes.",2017.0,10.1177/2167702616654898,J6YHQ5IN,1,missing,457.0

Clinical characteristics such as residual symptoms have been shown to negatively affect the long-term course of MDD. However, it is unclear so far how trait repetitive negative thinking (RNT) as well as cognitive and affective momentary states, the latter experienced during daily-life, affect the long-term course of MDD. METHOD: We followed up 57 remitted depressed (rMDD) individuals six (T2) and 36 (T3) months after baseline. Clinical outcomes were time to relapse, time spent with significant symptoms as a marker of chronicity, and levels of depressive symptoms at T2 and T3. Predictors assessed at baseline included residual symptoms and trait RNT. Furthermore, momentary daily life affect and momentary rumination, and their variation over the day were assessed at baseline using ambulatory assessment (AA). RESULTS: In multiple models, residual symptoms and instability of daily-life affect at baseline independently predicted a faster time to relapse, while chronicity was significantly predicted by trait RNT. Multilevel models revealed that depressive symptom levels during follow-up were predicted by baseline residual symptom levels and by instability of daily-life rumination. Both instability features were linked to a higher number of anamnestic MDD episodes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that trait RNT, but also affective and cognitive processes during daily life impact the longer-term course of MDD. Future longitudinal research on the role of respective AA-phenotypes as potential transdiagnostic course-modifiers is warranted.",2017.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0178759,LKYETG4X,1,additional,459.0

METHOD: Data were derived from 687 subjects in the general population with a lifetime DSM-III-R diagnosis of MDD but without a current major depressive episode (MDE) or dysthymia. Participants had to be at least 6 months in remission, and were recruited from The Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS), using the composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI). Recency and severity of the last MDE were assessed retrospectively at baseline. Recurrence of MDD was measured prospectively during the 3-year follow-up. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to measure time to recurrence. Determinants of time to recurrence were analyzed using proportional hazard models. RESULTS: The estimated cumulative recurrence of MDD was 13.2 \ \% \ at 5 years, 23.2 \ \% \ at 10 years and 42.0 \ \% \ at 20 years. In bivariate analysis, the following variables predicted a shorter time to recurrence: younger age, younger age of onset, higher number of previous episodes, a severe last depressive episode, negative youth experiences, ongoing difficulties before recurrence and high neuroticism. Multivariably, younger age, a higher number of previous episodes, a severe last depressive episode, negative youth experiences and ongoing difficulties remained significant.

METHOD: Participants were 303 patients (196 women and 107 men) with current DSM-IV-diagnosed MDD at baseline enrollment in the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study. Major depressive disorder and Axis I psychiatric disorders were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, and Axis II PDs were assessed with the Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders. The course of MDD was assessed with the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation at 6 and 12 months and then yearly through 6 years. Survival analyses were used to analyze time to remission and time to relapse. The study was conducted from July 1996 to June 2005. RESULTS: Of 303 patients, 260 (86 \ \% \ ) remitted from MDD; life table survival analyses revealed that patients with MDD who had PDs at baseline had significantly longer time to remission from MDD than patients without PDs. Among the 260 patients whose MDD remitted, 183 (70 \ \% \ ) relapsed. Patients with MDD with PDs-specifically those with borderline and obsessive-compulsive PDs-at baseline had significantly shorter time to relapse than patients with MDD without PDs. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses revealed that the presence of PDs at baseline (hazard ratio = 1.5) and recurrent-type MDD (hazard ratio = 2.2), but not sex (hazard ratio = 1.03) or dysthymic disorder (hazard ratio = 0.97), significantly predicted time to relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Personality disorders at baseline were robust predictors prospectively of accelerated relapse after remission from an episode of MDD.

31,30,"Vulnerability before, during, and after a major depressive episode: a 3-wave population-based study.","Ormel, Johan; Oldehinkel, Albertine J.; Vollebergh, Wilma","BACKGROUND: Vulnerability as defined by high levels of neuroticism, low self-esteem, and poor coping skills characterizes individuals with a history of major depressive episodes (MDEs). OBJECTIVE: To separate postmorbid vulnerability into (1) trait effects (ie, the continuation of premorbid vulnerability); (2) state effects of subthreshold (residual) symptoms on personality or its perception; and/or (3) scar effects (ie, negative personality change that develops during an MDE and persists beyond MDE remission). METHODS: Data come from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study, a prospective Dutch psychiatric population-based survey. We obtained psychiatric (Composite International Diagnostic Interview) and personality data on neuroticism, depressive coping style, self-esteem, and mastery from 4796 respondents at 3 time points (T1, T2, and T3), 12 and 24 months apart. Between- and within-subjects differences were tested with repeated-measures analysis of variance and adjusted for sex, age, and time. RESULTS: After T1, 409 respondents developed an MDE, of whom 334 were MDE-free at T3. In comparison with individuals without any lifetime MDE, the 262 subjects with a first MDE had higher premorbid T1 vulnerability scores on each personality measure (0.38-0.83 effect size units). During the MDE, vulnerability scores further increased (0.33-0.52 effect size units) but returned to premorbid levels after MDE remission. We found no scar effects among subgroups with severe or long-lasting MDEs. Subthreshold residual symptoms at T3 biased comparisons between T1 and T3 if the premorbid period of T1 to MDE onset was longer than the postmorbid period of MDE remission to T3, misleadingly suggesting scar effects. We obtained similar results in the 147 subjects with recurrent MDEs. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of a negative change from premorbid to postmorbid assessment for any of the personality traits. Postmorbid vulnerability reflected the continuation of premorbid vulnerability. Pre-post MDE comparisons are sensitive to prodromal and residual symptoms. Our findings suggest 2 independent simultaneous processes: (1) the ongoing expression of vulnerability as a personality deviance; and (2) synchrony of change between severity of depressive symptoms and personality deviance.",2004.0,10.1001/archpsyc.61.10.990,KYPB9HTF,1,cognitive,486.0

59,58,Multiple risk factors predict recurrence of major depressive disorder in women,"van Loo, Hanna M.; Aggen, Steven H.; Gardner, Charles O.; Kendler, Kenneth S.","Background It is difficult to predict recurrence of depressive episodes in patients with major depression (MD): evidence for many risk factors is inconsistent and general prediction algorithms are lacking. The aim of this study was to develop a prediction model for recurrence of depressive episodes in women using improved methodology. Methods We used prospective data from a general population sample of female twins with a last-year MD episode (n=194). A rich set of baseline predictors was analyzed with Cox proportional hazards regression subject to elastic net regularization to find a model predicting recurrence of depressive episodes. Prediction accuracy of the model was assessed in an independent test sample (n=133), which was limited by the unavailability of a number of key predictors. Results A wide variety of risk factors predicted recurrence of depressive episodes in women: depressive and anxiety symptoms during the index episode, the level of symptoms at the moment of interview, psychiatric and family history, early and recent adverse life events, being unmarried, and problems with friends and finances. Kaplan Meier estimated survival curves showed that the model differentiated between patients at higher and lower risk for recurrence; estimated areas under the curve were in the range of 0.61–0.79. Limitations Despite our rich set of predictors, certain potentially relevant variables were not available, such as biological measures, chronic somatic diseases, and treatment status. Conclusions Recurrence of episodes of MD in women is highly multifactorial. Future studies should take this into account for the development of clinically useful prediction algorithms.",2015.0,10.1016/j.jad.2015.03.045,GTYLP2D6,1,missing,500.0

J.; Checkley, S.","This paper reports the 1-year follow-up of a sample of depressed patients. Social cognitive variables obtained during the index episode, including ideal emotional support, roles and goals investment in various domains and dysfunctional attitudes were used to predict subjects' likelihood for subsequent relapse. More subjects who experienced severe life events in the year were found to have relapsed. However, the predictive value of life events was improved if adversity was in the most invested domain according to the roles and goals questionnaire that subjects filled in during their index episode (matching adversity). Subjects who experienced matching adversity had a 3-fold chance of relapse compared with subjects with nonmatching adversity. The majority of the matching events were in the interpersonal domain. Levels of dysfunctional attitudes alone did not predict relapse. However, matching adversity and the dependency subscale of the dysfunctional attitude scale contributed significantly both to whether or not subjects relapsed and to the number of weeks subjects survived before they relapsed. The higher the level of dependency dysfunctional attitudes, the sooner subjects relapsed.

Although baseline dysfunctional attitudes predicted an episode of major depression over 3 years of prospective study, this prediction, considered alone or in interaction with negative life events, was redundant with that offered by history of past depression.

Fifty-two participants were evaluated during remission, and their reactivity (i.e., change in dysfunctional attitudes and emotional state) to a depressed mood induction was evaluated. The cohort was followed up 12 months after the initial assessment. Thirty-five percent of the sample experienced a relapse during the follow-up period. Relapse was predicted by higher rates of life stress, and lower levels of emotional reactivity (specifically less reduction in happiness) to the mood induction during the initial assessment. Cognitive reactivity to the mood induction did not predict relapse, nor did the interaction between cognitive reactivity and life stress. These findings are discussed in terms of recent literature suggesting that depression is associated with insensitivity to emotion context, such that depressed individuals display blunted emotional responses to affective stimuli, including sadness-inducing stimuli. These findings suggest that insensitivity to emotional context may also be a characteristic of euthymic individuals at risk of relapse.",2008.0,10.1016/j.brat.2008.06.011,48ZCG8IC,1,cognitive,577.0

H.","BACKGROUND: Depression is a prevalent psychiatric disorder with high personal and public health consequences, partly due to a high risk of recurrence. This longitudinal study examines personality traits, structural and subjective social support dimensions as predictors of first and recurrent episodes of depression in initially non-depressed subjects. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). 1085 respondents without a current depression or anxiety diagnosis were included. 437 respondents had a prior history of depression, 648 did not. Personality dimensions were measured with the NEO-FFI, network size, partner-status, negative and positive emotional support were measured with the Close Person Questionnaire. Logistic regression analyses (unadjusted and adjusted for clinical variables and sociodemographic variables) examined whether these psychosocial variables predict a new episode of depression at two year follow up and whether this differed among persons with or without a history of depression. RESULTS: In the unadjusted analyses high extraversion (OR:.93, 95 \ \% \ CI (.91-.96), P \ \textless \ .001), agreeableness (OR:.94, 95 \ \% \ CI (.90-.97), P \ \textless \ .001), conscientiousness (OR:.93, 95 \ \% \ CI (.90-.96), P \ \textless \ .001) and a larger network size (OR:.76, 95 \ \% \ CI (.64-.90), P=.001) significantly reduced the risk of a new episode of depression.

Mean psychosocial functioning was below normal functioning at all assessments. Depression levels after discharge and unsatisfactory relationships within the support network predicted all outcomes. Furthermore, early onset, longer episode duration prior to study entry, and state orientation predicted time spent in episodes. Further predictors of time to recurrence included number of previous hospitalizations and lack of psychotherapy after discharge. Long-term psychosocial functioning was additionally predicted by previous hospitalizations, duration of index episode, and state orientation.

Significant predictors of relapse, accounting for 38 \% of the variance, included the number of previous episodes of depression, family history, poor health, history of depression in 1st-degree relatives, dissatisfaction with major life roles, depression level at entry to the study, and age.

Experiential avoidance predicted onset, relapse as well as maintenance of depressive disorders during the 4-year follow-up period. However, after controlling for rumination, worry and neuroticism, experiential avoidance no longer significantly predicted onset, relapse or maintenance of depressive disorders in contrast to repetitive thinking in the form of rumination or worry. Experiential avoidance also did not mediate or moderate the effect of rumination, worry and neuroticism.",2016.0,10.1007/s10608-015-9747-8,AIMEREX6,1,cognitive_additional,684.0

A total of 109 inpatients with MDD participated in this study. The subjects completed the TCI when they were assessed to be in remission. They were divided into high or low HA groups and high or low SD groups, as discriminated by the quartile value. A total of 69 patients were followed-up over a 4-year period or until recurrence. Both Kaplan-Meier analysis and Coxs proportional hazards regression analysis indicated that patients with a low SD score had a significantly shorter time to recurrence from remission than patients with a high SD score even when some prognostic predictors were controlled for. In contrast, HA was not found to be a predictor of recurrence for future depressive episodes. A part of MDD patients with low scores in Self-Directedness are likely to develop depression over a subsequent period of time. Interventions that improve SD may help to delay recurrence of depression in MDD patients.",2015.0,10.1016/j.psychres.2014.12.017,X7L647BT,1,personality,785.0
43,42,Personality and outcome in depression: an 18-month prospective follow-up study.,"O'Leary, D.; Costello, F.",BACKGROUND: The relationship between personality and depressive illness is complex. The aim of this study was to assess whether the presence of a personality disorder or high neuroticism (N) scores predicted longer times to discharge or remission onset or higher risks of relapse for a cohort of depressed subjects admitted for the first time. METHODS: 100 consecutive subjects with ICD-10-defined depression were recruited on admission and followed up prospectively over an 18-month period. Personality function was rated using the informant-rated Standard Assessment of Personality in addition to the self-rated Maudsley Personality Inventory. Remission onset and relapse were defined operationally by scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale using recommended criteria. RESULTS: The presence of a personality disorder predicted longer times to remission onset. Personality trait accentuation did not. Higher end N-scores correlated with longer times to remission onset. Neither personality disorder nor high N-scores predicted relapse or discharge risk. Subjects with a personality disorder were treated as aggressively as those without but those with higher N-scores were not. LIMITATIONS: It is an in-patient sample. Fifteen subjects dropped out of follow-up and those who did so were more likely to have met criteria for two or more personality disorder categories or four or more traits from one personality disorder category. The analysis assumes that state and scar effects on N-scores were minimised. Treatment decisions were not controlled. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the view that the presence of a personality disorder and high N-scores modify the short-term course to remission onset in depression.,2001.0,,NS8IIAUK,1,personality,794.0
52,51,Personality and clinical predictors of recurrence of depression.,"Berlanga, C.; Heinze, G.; Torres, M.; Apiquian, R.; Caballero, A.","OBJECTIVE: To help clinicians more accurately predict outcomes of treatment for depression, variables associated with recurrence of depression in the year after treatment were examined in a group of patients who completed treatment for an index episode of depression. METHODS: Forty-two depressed patients who participated in a double-blind pharmacological treatment study were followed for one year after treatment was discontinued. Length of treatment for the index episode was determined by clinicians and ranged from eight to 76 consecutive weeks. Eighteen patients who had a recurrent episode (43 percent) and 24 patients who did not (57 percent) were compared on sociodemographic and clinical variables, including scores on the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ). RESULTS: A combination of three variables predicted recurrence of depression in 90 percent of cases. They were an elevated EPQ score on the neuroticism subscale, a short duration of treatment of the index episode, and a slow onset of response to treatment of the index episode. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that personality traits, treatment duration, and variations in response to treatment might have an impact on long-term treatment outcome. Clinicians should consider these factors when making treatment decisions for depressed patients.",1999.0,10.1176/ps.50.3.376,BBB3EWKW,1,personality,811.0
19,18,Repetitive negative thinking as a predictor of depression and anxiety: A longitudinal cohort study,"Spinhoven, Philip; van Hemert, Albert M.; Penninx, Brenda W.","Background: Repetitive Negative Thinking (RNT) is assumed to be a transdiagnostic proximal risk factor in depression and anxiety. We examined the prospective relations of disorder-dependent as well as disorder-independent measures of RNT with depression and anxiety outcomes. Methods: In a prospective cohort study, 1972 adults completed a 3-year follow-up period (attrition = 12.6%). DSM-IV diagnoses were assessed with the CIDI, symptom severity with the IDS and BAI, and RNT with measures for perseverative thinking (PTQ), rumination (LEIDS-R) and worry (PWQ). Results: The common dimension of our RNT measurements (according to Confirmatory Factor Analysis) was significantly associated with comorbidity among depressive and among anxiety disorders, severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as persistence and relapse of depressive and anxiety disorders. Additionally, a specific factor for rumination predicted comorbidity of depressive disorders, comorbidity of anxiety disorders and relapse of depressive disorder, while a specific factor for worry predicted comorbidity of anxiety disorders and relapse of anxiety disorders, although to a lesser extent than general RNT. Limitations: The present study relied solely on self-report measures of RNT and controlling for baseline demographic and clinical variables greatly attenuated the predictive value of RNT. Discussion: Disorder-independent RNT may be a similar underlying process present across depressive and anxiety disorders. It seems more important than the representation of this process in disorder-specific cognitive content such as rumination in depression and worry in anxiety. RNT as a pathological trait deserves more attention in clinical diagnosis and the transdiagnostic treatment of comorbid depression and anxiety in particular.

Relapse was defined as at least a 2-wk period in which the S met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-Revised (DSM-III-R) criteria for major depression and had a Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score of 15 or more. 16 Ss relapsed during the follow-up. Correlates of relapse included a history of depressive episodes, higher levels of depressive symptoms and dysfunctional attitudes, slower response to therapy, and being unmarried. Ss who fully recovered during therapy were at significantly lower risk for relapse than those who partially recovered.

Methods Depression course was established by assessing 110 patients three-monthly with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview and the BDI, during a three-year period. Eight (groups of) predictors, assessed at baseline, were examined: socio-demographics, parental depression, history and severity of depression, anxiety, coping potential, social dysfunctioning and physical functioning. Results Time to recurrence was predicted by number of previous episodes (OR=1.91). Both proportion depressive disorder-free time and mean depression severity during follow-up were predicted by: severity of depression (B=−.19 and .21 respectively), anxiety (B=−.32 and .33), social dysfunctioning (B=−.21 and .22) and physical functioning (B=.24 and −.39). Mean severity was additionally predicted by: educational level (B=−.21), duration of the longest prior episode (B=.32), and coping potential (B=−.40). Coping potential and number of previous episodes were marginally significant predictors for all three outcomes. Limitations Although substantial, sample size was restricted. Conclusion Different outcome variables are predicted by different risk factors. Restriction to one outcome may lead to missing important determinants of the depression course.

Blatt et al., 1995) in a sample of graduate students with a diagnosed history of depression. A battery of tests was completed by 158 students, and a subset (n =102) was reached approximately 20 months later for the assessment of new depressive onsets. Self-criticism and neuroticism were uniquely associated with a past history of depression, and self-criticism and immature dependence interacted in predicting past occurrences of depression. Self-criticism was increasingly associated with past depressive episodes as level of immature dependence increased. The interaction of immature dependence and self-criticism was also evident in predicting future occurrence of depression after controlling statistically for the effects of current symptoms, neuroticism, certain Axis II diagnoses, and number of previous depressive episodes. This interactive effect suggests that individuals with high levels of both self-criticism and immature dependence are particularly prone to depressive episodes.",2006.0,10.1002/jclp.20263,IXTYMFJG,1,personality,1071.0

Assessments included several interview and self-report measures, and data on interpersonal relationships were obtained from close confidants. Follow-up interviews were conducted 6 mo later. After controlling for baseline severity, harsh discipline in childhood significantly predicted mean level of depression across the follow-up and level of depression at follow-up. Harsh discipline was also significantly associated with relapse but not with recovery.

17,16,Comparing chronic interpersonal and noninterpersonal stress domains as predictors of depression recurrence in emerging adults.,"Sheets, Erin S.; Craighead, W. Edward","Understanding how persistent interpersonal difficulties distinctly affect the course of major depressive disorder (MDD) during emerging adulthood is critical, given that early experiences impact future coping resources and functioning. Research on stress and MDD has mostly concentrated on stressful life events, while chronic stress largely has not been explored. The present study examined interpersonal (intimate relationship, close friendships, social life, family relationships) and noninterpersonal (academic, work, financial, personal health, and family members' health) domains of chronic stress as time-varying predictors of depressive recurrence in emerging adults. Baseline assessments identified previously depressed emerging adults (N = 119), who subsequently completed 6-month, 12-month and 18-month follow-up interviews to determine chronic stress experiences and onset of new major depressive episodes. Survival analyses indicated that time-varying total chronic stress and chronic interpersonal stress predicted higher risk for depression recurrence; however, chronic noninterpersonal stress was not associated with recurrence. Intimate relationship stress, close friendship stress, family relationship stress, personal health, and family members' health independently predicted MDD recurrence, over and above well-established depression risk factors of dysfunctional cognitions and personality disorder symptoms. Evidence that interpersonal stress could have substantial impact on course of depression is consistent with theories of emerging adulthood, a time when young people are individuating from the family and experiencing significant social transition.

27,26,Personality and cognitive vulnerability in remitted recurrently depressed patients.,"van Rijsbergen, Gerard D.; Kok, Gemma D.; Elgersma, Hermien J.; Hollon, Steven D.; Bockting, Claudi L. H.","INTRODUCTION: Personality disorders (PDs) have been associated with a poor prognosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The aim of the current study was to examine cognitive vulnerability (i.e., dysfunctional beliefs, extremity of beliefs, cognitive reactivity, and rumination) that might contribute to this poor prognosis of patients with PD comorbidity. METHODS: 309 outpatients with remitted recurrent MDD (SCID-I; HAM-D17 \textless /= 10) were included within two comparable RCTs and were assessed at baseline with the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-4(+) (PDQ-4(+)), the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale Version-A (DAS-A), the Leiden Index of Depression Sensitivity (LEIDS), the Ruminative Response Scale (RRS), and the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (IDS-SR). RESULTS: We found an indication that the PD prevalence was 49.5 \% in this remitted recurrently depressed sample. Having a PD (and higher levels of personality pathology) was associated with dysfunctional beliefs, cognitive reactivity, and rumination. Extreme 'black and white thinking' on the DAS was not associated with personality pathology. Brooding was only associated with a Cluster C classification (t(308) = 4.03, p \textless .001) and with avoidant PD specifically (t(308) = 4.82, p \textless .001), while surprisingly not with obsessive-compulsive PD. LIMITATIONS: PDs were assessed by questionnaire and the analyses were cross-sectional in nature. CONCLUSION: Being the first study to examine cognitive reactivity and rumination in patients with PD and remitted MDD, we demonstrated that even after controlling for depressive symptomatology, dysfunctional beliefs, cognitive reactivity, and rumination were associated with personality pathology. Rumination might be a pathway to relapse for patients with avoidant PD. Replication of our findings concerning cognitive vulnerability and specific PDs is necessary.",2015.0,10.1016/j.jad.2014.10.042,F2ZJXWIX,1,cognitive,1744.0

A.; Luty, Suzanne E.; Joyce, Peter R.","BACKGROUND: The clinically relevant outcomes in treating depression are persistent recovery, relapse, and treatment resistance. METHOD: 175 outpatients treated with antidepressants for 6 months were assessed for major depression. Those who had recovered were prospectively monitored for one year to study rates of relapse (at least two weeks of major depression). Those who were depressed at 6 months were monitored for rates of recovery (at least 8 weeks of no major depression). RESULTS: 94 \ \% \ of the sample was monitored for one year. Of the 123 patients who were not depressed at 6 months 57 (46 \ \% \ ) relapsed. Patients who relapsed were more likely to have a history of recurrent depression, to have residual depressive symptoms, to have a less sustained response to initial treatment, to have avoidant personality disorder symptoms, schizotypal personality disorder symptoms, higher harm avoidance (HA) scores and lower self directedness (SD) scores. Of the 38 patients who were depressed at 6 months 13 (34 \ \% \ ) recovered. There were no patient characteristics associated with recovery. LIMITATIONS: The findings apply to moderately depressed outpatients. There was no placebo control. CONCLUSION: Most patients with depression will recover but many become unwell again within a year.

58,57,Clinical factors associated with relapse in primary care patients with chronic or recurrent depression.,"Gopinath, Shamin; Katon, Wayne J.; Russo, Joan E.; Ludman, Evette J.","BACKGROUND: Because in most patients depression is a relapsing/remitting disorder, finding clinical factors associated with risk of relapse is important. The majority of patients with depression are treated in primary care settings, but few previous studies have examined predictors of relapse in primary care patients with recurrent or chronic depression. METHODS: Data from a cohort of 386 primary care patients in a clinical trial were analyzed for clinical and demographic predictors of relapse over a one-year post-study observational period. Patients were selected for a high risk of relapse, based on a history of either 3 previous depressive episodes or dysthymia, and enrolled in a randomized trial of relapse prevention. RESULTS: Factors found to be associated with significantly higher risk of relapse included poorer medication adherence in the 30 days prior to the trial, lower self-efficacy to manage depression, and higher scores on the Child Trauma Questionnaire. LIMITATIONS: Use of a sample of limited diversity taken from a clinical trial, and use of retrospective information from patients with potential for recall bias. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this report suggest specific risk factors to be targeted in depression relapse prevention interventions. It is encouraging that two of the factors associated with increased risk of relapse, self-efficacy and medication adherence have been seen to improve with the intervention utilized in the primary care trial from which the studied cohort was drawn.",2007.0,10.1016/j.jad.2006.10.023,EWILQGGR,1,behavior,2818.0
48,47,Adult attachment predicts the seven-year course of recurrent depression in primary care,"Conradi, H. J.; Kamphuis, J. H.; de Jonge, P.","BACKGROUND: Attachment theory posits that attachment has a persistent, long-term impact on depression. Empirical data on associations between adult attachment and the long-term course of depression is, however, scarce. The present study addresses this omission. METHOD: Primary care patients with a history of depression (n = 103) completed the Experiences in Close Relationships questionnaire measuring adult attachment dimensions (avoidance and anxiety) and styles (secure, preoccupied, dismissing and fearful). The subsequent seven-year course of depression was assessed with the face-to-face administered Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and a life-chart interview based on the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (LIFE). At the end of the seven-year follow-up severity of depression was additionally measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). RESULTS: The attachment dimensions avoidance and anxiety both showed significant associations during the seven-year course with lower proportions of depressive symptom-free time and higher severity of depression (LIFE and BDI). The secure style predicted compared to preoccupied attachment a significantly higher proportion of symptom-free time (4.97 vs. 1.10 years), compared to dismissing attachment a higher proportion of symptom-free time (4.97 vs. 2.20 years) and lower severity of depression (LIFE: 1.65 vs. 2.14; BDI 6.04 vs. 9.52), and compared to fearful attachment a lower relapse/recurrence rate (45.7% vs. 76.9%), higher proportions of depression diagnosis-free time (7.31 vs. 6.65 years) and symptom-free time (4.97 vs. 0.29 years), and lower severity of depression (LIFE: 1.65 vs. 2.19; BDI 6.04 vs. 15.54).

40,39,The association between levels of cortisol secretion and fear perception in patients with remitted depression predicts recurrence,"Bouhuys, A. L.; Bos, E. H.; Geerts, E. and","This study examines the association between cortisol secretion and fear perception in remitted patients to identify mechanisms underlying risk for recurrence of depression. We hypothesized that the stronger the association between cortisol secretion and fear perception in persons with remitted depression, the more recurrence would be experienced. We also investigated whether high levels of cortisol and fear perception per se predict more recurrence. These effects were assumed to be stronger in women than in men. In a prospective design, we investigated 77 outpatients with remitted depression and related the association between their 24-hour urinary free cortisol secretion and fear perception (from ambiguous faces and from vocal expressions) to recurrence of depression within 2 years. We applied Cox regression models, partial correlations, and Fisher z tests. In 21 patients, depression recurred. Irrespective the channel of perception (eye or ear), the interaction between fear perception and cortisol secretion was significantly related to recurrence of depression. Patients high or low on both variables are more at risk. This increased risk was also reflected by a significant association between cortisol secretion and facial fear perception, but only among subjects who experienced recurrence. A trend in the same direction was found for vocal fear perception. Fear perception and cortisol secretion per se did not predict recurrence. No gender differences were found. The association between cortisol secretion and fear perception (probably indicative for altered fear circuits in the brain) constitutes a mechanism underlying risk for recurrence of depression.

Petteri; Isometsa, Erkki T.","BACKGROUND: Information on the naturalistic outcome of major depressive disorder (MDD) is important in developing rational clinical practices. The aim of this study was to determine the outcome of MDD in a modern secondary-level psychiatric setting and the influence of comorbidity plus psychosocial factors on the outcome of MDD. METHOD: The Vantaa Depression Study is a prospective, naturalistic cohort study of 269 secondary-level care psychiatric outpatients and inpatients diagnosed with a new episode of DSM-IV MDD. Patients were initially interviewed to determine the presence of MDD using the World Health Organization Schedule for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry and to assess Axis II diagnoses using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R personality disorders between February 1, 1997, and May 31, 1998, and were interviewed again at 6 months and 18 months. The exact duration of the index episode and the timing of relapses/recurrences were examined using a life chart. RESULTS: The median length of time that patients met full criteria for a major depressive episode was 1.5 (95 \ \% \ CL = 1.3 to 1.7) months, and the median time to full remission was 8.1 (95 \ \% \ CL = 5.2 to 11.0) months after entry. During the follow-up, 38 \ \% \ of patients had a recurrence. Although numerous factors predict outcome of MDD to some extent, severity of depression and current comorbidity were the 2 most important predictors of longer episode duration and recurrence. CONCLUSION: The course of MDD in modern psychiatric settings remains unfavorable. Any estimates of duration of depressive episodes and rates of recurrence are likely to be dependent on the severity of depression and level of comorbidity. At least among a population of mostly outpatients with MDD in medium-term follow-up, severity of depression and comorbidity appear to be more useful predictors of recurrence than does the number of prior episodes. These factors should influence clinical decision-making regarding the need for maintenance therapy.",2004.0,,6SHZNRNV,1,personality,4619.0
32,31,Long-term outcome of major depressive disorder in psychiatric patients is variable.,"Holma, K. Mikael; Holma, Irina A. K.; Melartin, Tarja K.; Rytsala, Heikki J.; Isometsa, Erkki T.","Objective: The prevailing view of outcome of major depressive disorder (MDD), based on mostly inpatient cohorts sampled from tertiary centers, emphasizes chronicity and frequent recurrences. We investigated the long-term outcome of a regionally representative psychiatric MDD cohort comprising mainly outpatients. Method: The Vantaa Depression Study included 163 patients with DSM-IV MDD (71.5 \% of those eligible) diagnosed using structured and semistructured interviews and followed up at 6 months, 18 months, and 5 years with a life chart between February 1, 1997, and April 30, 2004. The effects of comorbid disorders and other predictors on outcome were comprehensively investigated. Results: Over the 5-year follow-up, 98.8 \% of patients achieved a symptom state below major depressive episode (MDE) criteria, and 88.4 \% reached full remission, with the median time to full remission being 11.0 months. Nearly one third (29.3 \% ) had no recurrences, whereas 30.0 \% experienced 1, 12.9 \% experienced 2, and 27.9 \% experienced 3 or more recurrences. Preceding dysthymic disorder (p = .028), cluster C personality disorder (p = .041), and longer MDE duration prior to entry (p = .011) were the most significant predictors of longer time in achieving full remission. Severity of MDD and comorbidity, especially social phobia, predicted probability of, shorter time to, and number of recurrences. Conclusion: Previous literature on mostly inpatient MDD may have, by generalizing from patients with the most severe psychopathology, overemphasized chronicity of MDD. The long-term outcome of MDD in psychiatric care is variable, with about one tenth of patients having poor, one third having intermediate, and one half having favorable outcomes. In addition to known predictors,.cluster C personality disorders and social phobia warrant further attention as predictors of MDD outcome among outpatients.

Seven variables are identified that account for outcome variance beyond that explained by pretreatment depression level: expected improvement, satisfaction with major life roles, concurrent treatment, perceived social support from family members, physical problems, suicidal attempts, and perceived mastery. Long-term follow-up and prediction of relapse are addressed. Modifications of the CWD course have also been successfully developed for depressed elderly populations, outpatients who failed to respond to antidepressant medication, and high school students (aged 14-28 yrs).
