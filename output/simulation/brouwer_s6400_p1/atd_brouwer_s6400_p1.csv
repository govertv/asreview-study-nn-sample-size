9,8,Immature dependence and self-criticism predict the recurrence of major depression.,"Mongrain, Myriam; Leather, Faith","This research examined the associations of unipolar depression with immature dependence and self-criticism (S.J. Blatt et al., 1995) in a sample of graduate students with a diagnosed history of depression. A battery of tests was completed by 158 students, and a subset (n =102) was reached approximately 20 months later for the assessment of new depressive onsets. Self-criticism and neuroticism were uniquely associated with a past history of depression, and self-criticism and immature dependence interacted in predicting past occurrences of depression. Self-criticism was increasingly associated with past depressive episodes as level of immature dependence increased. The interaction of immature dependence and self-criticism was also evident in predicting future occurrence of depression after controlling statistically for the effects of current symptoms, neuroticism, certain Axis II diagnoses, and number of previous depressive episodes. This interactive effect suggests that individuals with high levels of both self-criticism and immature dependence are particularly prone to depressive episodes.",2006.0,10.1002/jclp.20263,IXTYMFJG,1,personality,64.0
3,2,Practice of therapy acquired regulatory skills and depressive relapse/recurrence prophylaxis following cognitive therapy or mindfulness based cognitive therapy,"Segal, Zindel V.; Anderson, Adam K.; Gulamani, Tahira; Dinh Williams, Le-Ahn; Desormeau, Philip; Ferguson, Amanda; Walsh, Kathleen; Farb, Norman A. S.","Background: To investigate whether usage of treatment-acquired regulatory skills is associated with prevention of depressive relapse/recurrence. Method: Remitted depressed outpatients entered a 24-month clinical follow up after either 8 weekly group sessions of cognitive therapy (CT; N = 84) or mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT; N = 82). The primary outcome was symptom return meeting the criteria for major depression on Module A of the SCID. Results: Factor analysis identified three latent factors (53% of the variance): decentering (DC), distress tolerance (DT), and residual symptoms (RS), which were equivalent across CT and MBCT. Latent change score modeling of factor slopes over the follow up revealed positive slopes for DC (beta = .177), and for DT (beta = .259), but not for RS (beta = -.017), indicating posttreatment growth in DC and DT, but no change in RS. Cox regression indicated that DC slope was a significant predictor of relapse/recurrence prophylaxis, Hazard Ratio (HR) = .232 90% Confidence Interval (CI) [.067, .806], controlling for past depressive episodes, treatment group, and medication. The practice of therapy-acquired regulatory skills had no direct effect on relapse/recurrence (beta = .028) but predicted relapse/recurrence through an indirect path (beta = -.125), such that greater practice of regulatory skills following treatment promoted increases in DC (beta = .462), which, in turn, predicted a reduced risk of relapse/recurrence over 24 months (beta = -.270). Conclusions: Preventing major depressive disorder relapse/recurrence may depend upon developing DC in addition to managing residual symptoms. Following the acquisition of therapy skills during maintenance psychotherapies, DC is strengthened by continued skill utilization beyond treatment termination. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement What is the public health significance of this article?-People receiving maintenance psychotherapies for depression are expected to utilize emotion regulation skills past the point of active treatment but receive little guidance regarding which skills are most effective. Our data suggest that resilience to episode return depends upon the development of metacognitive skills for the regulation of distressing thoughts and emotions.

4,3,How does cognitive therapy prevent relapse in residual depression? Evidence from a controlled trial.,"Teasdale, John D.; Scott, Jan; Moore, Richard G.; Hayhurst, Hazel; Pope, Marie; http://orcid.org/Scott","This study examined the cognitive mediation of relapse prevention by cognitive therapy (CT) in a trial of 158 patients with residual depression. Scores based on agreement with item content of 5 questionnaires of depression-related cognition provided no evidence for cognitive mediation. A measure of the form of response to those questionnaires, the number of times patients used extreme response categories ( totally agree and totally disagree ), showed significant and substantial prediction of relapse, differential response to CT, and conformity to mediational criteria. CT reduced relapse through reductions in absolutist, dichotomous thinking style. CT may prevent relapse by training patients to change the way that they process depression-related material rather than by changing belief in depressive thought content.

7,6,An evaluation of an integrated model of relapse in depression.,"Backs-Dermott, Barbara J.; Dobson, Keith S.; Jones, Shannon L.","BACKGROUND AND AIM: The present study evaluated an integrated model of the role of psychosocial factors in the prediction of relapse of Major Depressive Disorder over a one-year follow-up period. METHODS AND ANALYSES: A range of established variables, including life stress, cognitive-personality vulnerability factors, social support, and coping responses, were simultaneously considered in a series of prediction models, in an adult female sample of remitted depressed individuals. RESULTS: It was determined that interpersonal marked difficulties, social support, and emotion-oriented and avoidance-oriented coping provided the best-fitting and most parsimonious predictive model for depressive relapse at one-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The examination of multifactorial models of risk represents a promising avenue for future research and theory development.",2010.0,10.1016/j.jad.2009.11.015,2SBHSG6Y,1,cognitive,1398.0
8,7,"The influence of psychopathology, personality, and marital interaction on the short-term course of major depression.","Mundt, C.; Kronmuller, K. T.; Backenstrass, M.; Reck, C.; Fiedler, P.","By means of an aggregated variables design the domains of 'psychopathology', 'personality', and 'social interaction' were weighted according to their impact on the 2-year course of 50 patients with unipolar major depression. Preindex course ranked highest, asthenic personality second. Variables of social interaction disappeared in the second-order logistic regression. These findings fit in well with the recent literature. They are interpreted in terms of habituation processes and residual personality changes which lower the vulnerability threshold for relapse and unfavorable course. As a consequence of this conclusion early relapse prevention would be most important.",1998.0,,UF5F6JV6,1,personality,1943.0
6,5,Clinical presentation and course of depression in youth: does onset in childhood differ from onset in adolescence?,"Birmaher, Boris; Williamson, Douglas E.; Dahl, Ronald E.; Axelson, David A.; Kaufman, Joan; Dorn, Lorah D.; Ryan, Neal D.","OBJECTIVE: To simultaneously and prospectively compare the clinical presentation, course, and parental psychiatric history between children and adolescents with major depressive disorder. METHOD: A group of prepubertal children (n = 46) and postpubertal adolescents (n = 22) were assessed with structured interviews for psychopathology and parental psychiatric history and followed once every 2 years for approximately 5 years. RESULTS: With the exception of more depressive melancholic symptoms in the adolescents, both groups had similar depressive symptomatology, duration (average 17 months), severity of the index episode, rates of recovery (85 \% ) and recurrence (40 \% ), comorbid disorders, and parental psychiatric history. Female sex, increased guilt, prior episodes of depression, and parental psychopathology were associated with worse longitudinal course. CONCLUSIONS: In general, major depressive disorder is manifested similarly in children and adolescents, and both groups have a protracted clinical course and high family loading for psychiatric disorders.",2004.0,10.1097/00004583-200401000-00015,IYJSZWT9,1,psychodynamic,2820.0
10,9,Personality and social support as predictors of first and recurrent episodes of depression.,"Noteboom, Annemieke; Beekman, Aartjan T. F.; Vogelzangs, Nicole; Penninx, Brenda W. J. H.","BACKGROUND: Depression is a prevalent psychiatric disorder with high personal and public health consequences, partly due to a high risk of recurrence. This longitudinal study examines personality traits, structural and subjective social support dimensions as predictors of first and recurrent episodes of depression in initially non-depressed subjects. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). 1085 respondents without a current depression or anxiety diagnosis were included. 437 respondents had a prior history of depression, 648 did not. Personality dimensions were measured with the NEO-FFI, network size, partner-status, negative and positive emotional support were measured with the Close Person Questionnaire. Logistic regression analyses (unadjusted and adjusted for clinical variables and sociodemographic variables) examined whether these psychosocial variables predict a new episode of depression at two year follow up and whether this differed among persons with or without a history of depression. RESULTS: In the unadjusted analyses high extraversion (OR:.93, 95 \ \% \ CI (.91-.96), P \ \textless \ .001), agreeableness (OR:.94, 95 \ \% \ CI (.90-.97), P \ \textless \ .001), conscientiousness (OR:.93, 95 \ \% \ CI (.90-.96), P \ \textless \ .001) and a larger network size (OR:.76, 95 \ \% \ CI (.64-.90), P=.001) significantly reduced the risk of a new episode of depression. Only neuroticism predicted a new episode of depression in both the unadjusted (OR:1.13, 95 \ \% \ CI (1.10-1.15), P \ \textless \ .001) and adjusted analyses (OR:1.06, 95 \ \% \ CI (1.03-1.10), P \ \textless \ .001). None of the predictors predicted first or recurrent episodes of depression differently. LIMITATIONS: we used a relatively short follow up period and broad personality dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: Neuroticism seems to predict both first and recurrent episodes of depression and may be suitable for screening for preventive interventions.",2016.0,10.1016/j.jad.2015.09.020,LUHSYTDF,1,personality,4240.0
5,4,Severity and comorbidity predict episode duration and recurrence of DSM-IV major depressive disorder.,"Melartin, Tarja K.; Rytsala, Heikki J.; Leskela, Ulla S.; Lestela-Mielonen, Paula S.; Sokero, T. Petteri; Isometsa, Erkki T.","BACKGROUND: Information on the naturalistic outcome of major depressive disorder (MDD) is important in developing rational clinical practices. The aim of this study was to determine the outcome of MDD in a modern secondary-level psychiatric setting and the influence of comorbidity plus psychosocial factors on the outcome of MDD. METHOD: The Vantaa Depression Study is a prospective, naturalistic cohort study of 269 secondary-level care psychiatric outpatients and inpatients diagnosed with a new episode of DSM-IV MDD. Patients were initially interviewed to determine the presence of MDD using the World Health Organization Schedule for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry and to assess Axis II diagnoses using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R personality disorders between February 1, 1997, and May 31, 1998, and were interviewed again at 6 months and 18 months. The exact duration of the index episode and the timing of relapses/recurrences were examined using a life chart. RESULTS: The median length of time that patients met full criteria for a major depressive episode was 1.5 (95 \ \% \ CL = 1.3 to 1.7) months, and the median time to full remission was 8.1 (95 \ \% \ CL = 5.2 to 11.0) months after entry. During the follow-up, 38 \ \% \ of patients had a recurrence. Although numerous factors predict outcome of MDD to some extent, severity of depression and current comorbidity were the 2 most important predictors of longer episode duration and recurrence. CONCLUSION: The course of MDD in modern psychiatric settings remains unfavorable. Any estimates of duration of depressive episodes and rates of recurrence are likely to be dependent on the severity of depression and level of comorbidity. At least among a population of mostly outpatients with MDD in medium-term follow-up, severity of depression and comorbidity appear to be more useful predictors of recurrence than does the number of prior episodes. These factors should influence clinical decision-making regarding the need for maintenance therapy.",2004.0,,6SHZNRNV,1,personality,4352.0
