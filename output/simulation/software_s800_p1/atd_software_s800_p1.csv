10,9,Using the Conceptual Cohesion of Classes for Fault Prediction in Object-Oriented Systems,"High cohesion is a desirable property of software as it positively impacts understanding, reuse, and maintenance. Currently proposed measures for cohesion in Object-Oriented (OO) software reflect particular interpretations of cohesion and capture different aspects of it. Existing approaches are largely based on using the structural information from the source code, such as attribute references, in methods to measure cohesion. This paper proposes a new measure for the cohesion of classes in OO software systems based on the analysis of the unstructured information embedded in the source code, such as comments and identifiers. The measure, named the Conceptual Cohesion of Classes (C3), is inspired by the mechanisms used to measure textual coherence in cognitive psychology and computational linguistics. This paper presents the principles and the technology that stand behind the C3 measure. A large case study on three open source software systems is presented which compares the new measure with an extensive set of existing metrics and uses them to construct models that predict software faults. The case study shows that the novel measure captures different aspects of class cohesion compared to any of the existing cohesion measures. In addition, combining C3 with existing structural cohesion metrics proves to be a better predictor of faulty classes when compared to different combinations of structural cohesion metrics.",2008,1,,2.0
7,6,Variance Analysis in Software Fault Prediction Models,"Software fault prediction models play an important role in software quality assurance. They identify software subsystems (modules,components, classes, or files) which are likely to contain faults. These subsystems, in turn, receive additional resources for verification and validation activities. Fault prediction models are binary classifiers typically developed using one of the supervised learning techniques from either a subset of the fault data from the current project or from a similar past project. In practice, it is critical that such models provide a reliable prediction performance on the data not used in training. Variance is an important reliability indicator of software fault prediction models. However, variance is often ignored or barely mentioned in many published studies. In this paper, through the analysis of twelve data sets from a public software engineering repository from the perspective of variance, we explore the following five questions regarding fault prediction models: (1) Do different types ofclassification performance measures exhibit different variance? (2) Does the size of the data set imply a more (or less) accurate prediction performance? (3) Does the size of training subset impact model's stability? (4) Do different classifiers consistently exhibit different performance in terms of model's variance? (5) Are there differences between variance from 1000 runs and 10 runs of 10-fold cross validation experiments? Our results indicate that variance is a very important factor in understanding fault prediction models and we recommend the best practice for reporting variance in empirical software engineering studies.",2009,1,,7.0
5,4,Using Faults-Slip-Through Metric as a Predictor of Fault-Proneness,"Background: The majority of software faults are present in small number of modules, therefore accurate prediction of fault-prone modules helps improve software quality by focusing testing efforts on a subset of modules. Aims: This paper evaluates the use of the faults-slip-through (FST) metric as a potential predictor of fault-prone modules. Rather than predicting the fault-prone modules for the complete test phase, the prediction is done at the specific test levels of integration and system test. Method: We applied eight classification techniques, to the task of identifying fault prone modules, representing a variety of approaches, including a standard statistical technique for classification (logistic regression), tree-structured classifiers (C4.5 and random forests), a Bayesian technique (Naive Bayes), machine-learning techniques (support vector machines and back-propagation artificial neural networks) and search-based techniques (genetic programming and artificial immune recognition systems) on FST data collected from two large industrial projects from the telecommunication domain. Results: Using area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the location of (PF, PD) pairs in the ROC space, the faults slip-through metric showed impressive results with the majority of the techniques for predicting fault-prone modules at both integration and system test levels. There were, however, no statistically significant differences between the performance of different techniques based on AUC, even though certain techniques were more consistent in the classification performance at the two test levels. Conclusions: We can conclude that the faults-slip-through metric is a potentially strong predictor of fault-proneness at integration and system test levels. The faults-slip-through measurements interact in ways that is conveniently accounted for by majority of the data mining techniques.",2010,1,,10.0
3,2,Test effort optimization by prediction and ranking of fault-prone software modules,"Identification of fault-prone or not fault-prone modules is very essential to improve the reliability and quality of a software system. Once modules are categorized as fault-prone or not fault-prone, test effort are allocated accordingly. Testing effort and efficiency are primary concern and can be optimized by prediction and ranking of fault-prone modules. This paper discusses a new model for prediction and ranking of fault-prone software modules for test effort optimization. Model utilizes the classification capability of data mining techniques and knowledge stored in software metrics to classify the software module as fault-prone or not fault-prone. A decision tree is constructed using ID3 algorithm for the existing project data. Rules are derived form the decision tree and integrated with fuzzy inference system to classify the modules as either fault-prone or not fault-prone for the target data. The model is also able to rank the fault-prone module on the basis of its degree of fault-proneness. The model accuracy are validated and compared with some other models by using the NASA projects data set of PROMOSE repository.",2010,1,,18.0
11,10,Software Fault Prediction using Language Processing,"Accurate prediction of faulty modules reduces the cost of software development and evolution. Two case studies with a language-processing based fault prediction measure are presented. The measure, refereed to as a QALP score, makes use of techniques from information retrieval to judge software quality. The QALP score has been shown to correlate with human judgements of software quality. The two case studies consider the measure's application to fault prediction using two programs (one open source, one proprietary). Linear mixed-effects regression models are used to identify relationships between defects and QALP score. Results, while complex, show that little correlation exists in the first case study, while statistically significant correlations exists in the second. In this second study the QALP score is helpful in predicting faults in modules (files) with its usefulness growing as module size increases.",2007,1,,25.0
6,5,Reducing Features to Improve Bug Prediction,"Recently, machine learning classifiers have emerged as a way to predict the existence of a bug in a change made to a source code file. The classifier is first trained on software history data, and then used to predict bugs. Two drawbacks of existing classifier-based bug prediction are potentially insufficient accuracy for practical use, and use of a large number of features. These large numbers of features adversely impact scalability and accuracy of the approach. This paper proposes a feature selection technique applicable to classification-based bug prediction. This technique is applied to predict bugs in software changes, and performance of Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers is characterized.",2009,1,,34.0
4,3,A Rough Set Model for Software Defect Prediction,High assurance software requires extensive and expensive assessment. Many software organizations frequently do not allocate enough resources for software quality. We research the defect detectors focusing on the data sets of software defect prediction. A rough set model is presented to deal with the attributes of data sets of software defect prediction in this paper. Appling this model to the most famous public domain data set created by the NASA's metrics data program shows its splendid performance.,2008,1,,50.0
9,8,Application of neural network for predicting software development faults using object-oriented design metrics,"In this paper, we present the application of neural network for predicting software development faults including object-oriented faults. Object-oriented metrics can be used in quality estimation. In practice, quality estimation means either estimating reliability or maintainability. In the context of object-oriented metrics work, reliability is typically measured as the number of defects. Object-oriented design metrics are used as the independent variables and the number of faults is used as dependent variable in our study. Software metrics used include those concerning inheritance measures, complexity measures, coupling measures and object memory allocation measures. We also test the goodness of fit of neural network model by comparing the prediction result for software faults with multiple regression model. Our study is conducted on three industrial real-time systems that contain a number of natural faults that has been reported for three years (Mei-Huei Tang et al., 1999).",2002,1,,52.0
8,7,Evaluating Defect Prediction Models for a Large Evolving Software System,"A plethora of defect prediction models has been proposed and empirically evaluated, often using standard classification performance measures. In this paper, we explore defect prediction models for a large, multi-release software system from the telecommunications domain. A history of roughly 3 years is analyzed to extract process and static code metrics that are used to build several defect prediction models with random forests. The performance of the resulting models is comparable to previously published work. Furthermore, we develop a new evaluation measure based on the comparison to an optimal model.",2009,1,,54.0
