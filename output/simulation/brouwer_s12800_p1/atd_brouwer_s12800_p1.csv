3,2,Practice of therapy acquired regulatory skills and depressive relapse/recurrence prophylaxis following cognitive therapy or mindfulness based cognitive therapy,"Segal, Zindel V.; Anderson, Adam K.; Gulamani, Tahira; Dinh Williams, Le-Ahn; Desormeau, Philip; Ferguson, Amanda; Walsh, Kathleen; Farb, Norman A. S.","Background: To investigate whether usage of treatment-acquired regulatory skills is associated with prevention of depressive relapse/recurrence. Method: Remitted depressed outpatients entered a 24-month clinical follow up after either 8 weekly group sessions of cognitive therapy (CT; N = 84) or mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT; N = 82). The primary outcome was symptom return meeting the criteria for major depression on Module A of the SCID. Results: Factor analysis identified three latent factors (53% of the variance): decentering (DC), distress tolerance (DT), and residual symptoms (RS), which were equivalent across CT and MBCT. Latent change score modeling of factor slopes over the follow up revealed positive slopes for DC (beta = .177), and for DT (beta = .259), but not for RS (beta = -.017), indicating posttreatment growth in DC and DT, but no change in RS. Cox regression indicated that DC slope was a significant predictor of relapse/recurrence prophylaxis, Hazard Ratio (HR) = .232 90% Confidence Interval (CI) [.067, .806], controlling for past depressive episodes, treatment group, and medication. The practice of therapy-acquired regulatory skills had no direct effect on relapse/recurrence (beta = .028) but predicted relapse/recurrence through an indirect path (beta = -.125), such that greater practice of regulatory skills following treatment promoted increases in DC (beta = .462), which, in turn, predicted a reduced risk of relapse/recurrence over 24 months (beta = -.270). Conclusions: Preventing major depressive disorder relapse/recurrence may depend upon developing DC in addition to managing residual symptoms. Following the acquisition of therapy skills during maintenance psychotherapies, DC is strengthened by continued skill utilization beyond treatment termination. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement What is the public health significance of this article?-People receiving maintenance psychotherapies for depression are expected to utilize emotion regulation skills past the point of active treatment but receive little guidance regarding which skills are most effective. Our data suggest that resilience to episode return depends upon the development of metacognitive skills for the regulation of distressing thoughts and emotions.

4,3,How does cognitive therapy prevent relapse in residual depression? Evidence from a controlled trial.,"Teasdale, John D.; Scott, Jan; Moore, Richard G.; Hayhurst, Hazel; Pope, Marie; http://orcid.org/Scott","This study examined the cognitive mediation of relapse prevention by cognitive therapy (CT) in a trial of 158 patients with residual depression. Scores based on agreement with item content of 5 questionnaires of depression-related cognition provided no evidence for cognitive mediation. A measure of the form of response to those questionnaires, the number of times patients used extreme response categories ( totally agree and totally disagree ), showed significant and substantial prediction of relapse, differential response to CT, and conformity to mediational criteria. CT reduced relapse through reductions in absolutist, dichotomous thinking style. CT may prevent relapse by training patients to change the way that they process depression-related material rather than by changing belief in depressive thought content.

A.; Cohen, L. S.; Soares, C. N.; Vitonis, A. F.; Harlow, B. L.","In a large, community-based sample of women (N = 750), the authors examined the nature of associations between dysfunctional attitudes and depression. Dysfunctional attitudes were evaluated both as a vulnerability factor for depression and as a consequence of depression. A link was found between past depression and baseline elevations in dysfunctional attitudes that was independent of current subsyndromal symptoms, but intensification of dysfunctional attitudes following prospectively evaluated episodes of depression (depressive scarring ) was not observed. Although baseline dysfunctional attitudes predicted an episode of major depression over 3 years of prospective study, this prediction, considered alone or in interaction with negative life events, was redundant with that offered by history of past depression. Further, no significant prediction was evident for the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (A. N. Weissman \& A. T. Beck, 1978) when the formerly depressed and never-depressed cohorts were considered separately.

T.; Backenstrass, M.; Reck, C.; Fiedler, P.","By means of an aggregated variables design the domains of 'psychopathology', 'personality', and 'social interaction' were weighted according to their impact on the 2-year course of 50 patients with unipolar major depression. Preindex course ranked highest, asthenic personality second. Variables of social interaction disappeared in the second-order logistic regression. These findings fit in well with the recent literature. They are interpreted in terms of habituation processes and residual personality changes which lower the vulnerability threshold for relapse and unfavorable course. As a consequence of this conclusion early relapse prevention would be most important.",1998.0,,UF5F6JV6,1,personality,514.0
12,11,"Is Experiential Avoidance a Mediating, Moderating, Independent, Overlapping, or Proxy Risk Factor in the Onset, Relapse and Maintenance of Depressive Disorders?","Spinhoven, P.; Drost, J.; de Rooij, M.; van Hemert, A. M.; Penninx, B. W. J. H.","Our study aim was to investigate how experiential avoidance ‘works together' with bordering psychological constructs (i.e., rumination, worry and neuroticism) in predicting the onset, relapse and maintenance of depressive disorders. We performed a longitudinal cohort study with repeated assessments after 2 and 4 years in a sample of 737 persons with a 6-month recency dysthymic and/or major depressive disorder, a sample of 1150 remitted persons with a history of previous depressive disorders; and a sample of 626 persons with no 6-month recency depressive or anxiety disorders and no previous depressive disorders. Experiential avoidance predicted onset, relapse as well as maintenance of depressive disorders during the 4-year follow-up period. However, after controlling for rumination, worry and neuroticism, experiential avoidance no longer significantly predicted onset, relapse or maintenance of depressive disorders in contrast to repetitive thinking in the form of rumination or worry. Experiential avoidance also did not mediate or moderate the effect of rumination, worry and neuroticism.",2016.0,10.1007/s10608-015-9747-8,AIMEREX6,1,cognitive_additional,551.0
7,6,An evaluation of an integrated model of relapse in depression.,"Backs-Dermott, Barbara J.; Dobson, Keith S.; Jones, Shannon L.","BACKGROUND AND AIM: The present study evaluated an integrated model of the role of psychosocial factors in the prediction of relapse of Major Depressive Disorder over a one-year follow-up period. METHODS AND ANALYSES: A range of established variables, including life stress, cognitive-personality vulnerability factors, social support, and coping responses, were simultaneously considered in a series of prediction models, in an adult female sample of remitted depressed individuals. RESULTS: It was determined that interpersonal marked difficulties, social support, and emotion-oriented and avoidance-oriented coping provided the best-fitting and most parsimonious predictive model for depressive relapse at one-year follow-up.

9,8,Immature dependence and self-criticism predict the recurrence of major depression.,"Mongrain, Myriam; Leather, Faith","This research examined the associations of unipolar depression with immature dependence and self-criticism (S.J. Blatt et al., 1995) in a sample of graduate students with a diagnosed history of depression. A battery of tests was completed by 158 students, and a subset (n =102) was reached approximately 20 months later for the assessment of new depressive onsets. Self-criticism and neuroticism were uniquely associated with a past history of depression, and self-criticism and immature dependence interacted in predicting past occurrences of depression. Self-criticism was increasingly associated with past depressive episodes as level of immature dependence increased. The interaction of immature dependence and self-criticism was also evident in predicting future occurrence of depression after controlling statistically for the effects of current symptoms, neuroticism, certain Axis II diagnoses, and number of previous depressive episodes. This interactive effect suggests that individuals with high levels of both self-criticism and immature dependence are particularly prone to depressive episodes.",2006.0,10.1002/jclp.20263,IXTYMFJG,1,personality,600.0
10,9,Personality and social support as predictors of first and recurrent episodes of depression.,"Noteboom, Annemieke; Beekman, Aartjan T. F.; Vogelzangs, Nicole; Penninx, Brenda W. J. H.","BACKGROUND: Depression is a prevalent psychiatric disorder with high personal and public health consequences, partly due to a high risk of recurrence. This longitudinal study examines personality traits, structural and subjective social support dimensions as predictors of first and recurrent episodes of depression in initially non-depressed subjects. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). 1085 respondents without a current depression or anxiety diagnosis were included. 437 respondents had a prior history of depression, 648 did not. Personality dimensions were measured with the NEO-FFI, network size, partner-status, negative and positive emotional support were measured with the Close Person Questionnaire. Logistic regression analyses (unadjusted and adjusted for clinical variables and sociodemographic variables) examined whether these psychosocial variables predict a new episode of depression at two year follow up and whether this differed among persons with or without a history of depression. RESULTS: In the unadjusted analyses high extraversion (OR:.93, 95 \ \% \ CI (.91-.96), P \ \textless \ .001), agreeableness (OR:.94, 95 \ \% \ CI (.90-.97), P \ \textless \ .001), conscientiousness (OR:.93, 95 \ \% \ CI (.90-.96), P \ \textless \ .001) and a larger network size (OR:.76, 95 \ \% \ CI (.64-.90), P=.001) significantly reduced the risk of a new episode of depression. Only neuroticism predicted a new episode of depression in both the unadjusted (OR:1.13, 95 \ \% \ CI (1.10-1.15), P \ \textless \ .001) and adjusted analyses (OR:1.06, 95 \ \% \ CI (1.03-1.10), P \ \textless \ .001). None of the predictors predicted first or recurrent episodes of depression differently. LIMITATIONS: we used a relatively short follow up period and broad personality dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: Neuroticism seems to predict both first and recurrent episodes of depression and may be suitable for screening for preventive interventions.",2016.0,10.1016/j.jad.2015.09.020,LUHSYTDF,1,personality,607.0
13,12,Longitudinal follow-up of unipolar depressives: An investigation of predictors of relapse.,"Gonzales, Linda R.; Lewinsohn, Peter M.; Clarke, Gregory N.","Conducted longitudinal interval follow-up evaluations, using the method described by R. Shapiro and M. Keller (unpublished), with 113 19-60 yr old unipolar depressives who had completed a cognitive-behavioral intervention in an examination of 1- to 3-yr outcomes and risk factors for relapse. Ss were administered the Beck Depression Inventory, the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, and a life satisfaction scale. 59, 28, and 26 Ss were assigned to major depressive, intermittent depressive, and double depressive categories, respectively, according to pretreatment symptomatology and the Research Diagnostic Criteria. Results indicate that the recovery rate of the major depressives (75 \% ) was significantly higher than that of the intermittent depressives (43 \% ) or that of the superimposed depressives (27 \% ). Significant predictors of relapse, accounting for 38 \% of the variance, included the number of previous episodes of depression, family history, poor health, history of depression in 1st-degree relatives, dissatisfaction with major life roles, depression level at entry to the study, and age.

15,14,Recurrence of major depressive disorder and its predictors in the general population: results from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS).,"Hardeveld, F.; Spijker, J. and","BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the risk of recurrence after recovery from major depressive disorder (MDD) in the general population is scarce. METHOD: Data were derived from 687 subjects in the general population with a lifetime DSM-III-R diagnosis of MDD but without a current major depressive episode (MDE) or dysthymia. Participants had to be at least 6 months in remission, and were recruited from The Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS), using the composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI). Recency and severity of the last MDE were assessed retrospectively at baseline. Recurrence of MDD was measured prospectively during the 3-year follow-up. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to measure time to recurrence. Determinants of time to recurrence were analyzed using proportional hazard models. RESULTS: The estimated cumulative recurrence of MDD was 13.2 \ \% \ at 5 years, 23.2 \ \% \ at 10 years and 42.0 \ \% \ at 20 years. In bivariate analysis, the following variables predicted a shorter time to recurrence: younger age, younger age of onset, higher number of previous episodes, a severe last depressive episode, negative youth experiences, ongoing difficulties before recurrence and high neuroticism. Multivariably, younger age, a higher number of previous episodes, a severe last depressive episode, negative youth experiences and ongoing difficulties remained significant. CONCLUSIONS: In this community sample, the long-term risk of recurrence was high, but lower than that found in clinical samples. Subjects who had had an MDE had a long-term vulnerability for recurrence. Factors predicting recurrence included illness- and stress-related factors.",2013.0,10.1017/S0033291712002395,WP4DWLKK,1,personality,881.0

H.","OBJECTIVE: To examine the prognostic value of personality dimensions and negative and positive life events for diagnostic and symptom course trajectories in depressive and anxiety disorder. METHOD: A total of 1209 subjects (18-65 years) with depressive and/or anxiety disorder were recruited in primary and specialized mental health care. Personality dimensions at baseline were assessed with the NEO-FFI and incidence and date of life events retrospectively with a structured interview at 2-year follow-up. DSM-IV-based diagnostic interviews as well as life chart assessments allowed course assessment at both the diagnostic and symptom trajectory level over 2 years. RESULTS: Life events were significantly related to diagnostic and symptom course trajectories of depression and anxiety also after correcting for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Only negative life events prospectively predicted longer time to remission of depressive disorder. Prospective associations of neuroticism and extraversion with prognosis of anxiety and depression were greatly reduced after correcting for baseline severity and duration of index disorder. Personality traits did not moderate the effect of life events on 2-year course indicators. CONCLUSIONS: Negative life events have an independent effect on diagnostic and symptom course trajectories of depression and to a lesser extent anxiety unconfounded by sociodemographic, clinical, and personality characteristics.",2011.0,10.1111/j.1600-0447.2011.01753.x,7BGWZTMX,1,personality,958.0
11,10,Prediction of the three-year course of recurrent depression in primary care patients: Different risk factors for different outcomes,"Conradi, Henk Jan; de Jonge, Peter; Ormel, Johan","Background The objectives of this study are: (1) identification of predictors for the three-year course of recurrent depression in the rarely studied, but relevant sample of primary care patients, and (2) investigation whether different outcome indicators, time to recurrence, proportion depression-free time and mean severity of depressive symptoms during follow-up, are associated with different risk factors. Methods Depression course was established by assessing 110 patients three-monthly with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview and the BDI, during a three-year period. Eight (groups of) predictors, assessed at baseline, were examined: socio-demographics, parental depression, history and severity of depression, anxiety, coping potential, social dysfunctioning and physical functioning. Results Time to recurrence was predicted by number of previous episodes (OR=1.91). Both proportion depressive disorder-free time and mean depression severity during follow-up were predicted by: severity of depression (B=−.19 and .21 respectively), anxiety (B=−.32 and .33), social dysfunctioning (B=−.21 and .22) and physical functioning (B=.24 and −.39). Mean severity was additionally predicted by: educational level (B=−.21), duration of the longest prior episode (B=.32), and coping potential (B=−.40). Coping potential and number of previous episodes were marginally significant predictors for all three outcomes. Limitations Although substantial, sample size was restricted. Conclusion Different outcome variables are predicted by different risk factors. Restriction to one outcome may lead to missing important determinants of the depression course. Number of prior episodes and coping potential seem to warrant special attention from the GP.",2008.0,10.1016/j.jad.2007.04.017,4FARZIFW,1,missing,976.0
5,4,Severity and comorbidity predict episode duration and recurrence of DSM-IV major depressive disorder.,"Melartin, Tarja K.; Rytsala, Heikki J.; Leskela, Ulla S.; Lestela-Mielonen, Paula S.; Sokero, T. Petteri; Isometsa, Erkki T.","BACKGROUND: Information on the naturalistic outcome of major depressive disorder (MDD) is important in developing rational clinical practices. The aim of this study was to determine the outcome of MDD in a modern secondary-level psychiatric setting and the influence of comorbidity plus psychosocial factors on the outcome of MDD. METHOD: The Vantaa Depression Study is a prospective, naturalistic cohort study of 269 secondary-level care psychiatric outpatients and inpatients diagnosed with a new episode of DSM-IV MDD. Patients were initially interviewed to determine the presence of MDD using the World Health Organization Schedule for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry and to assess Axis II diagnoses using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R personality disorders between February 1, 1997, and May 31, 1998, and were interviewed again at 6 months and 18 months. The exact duration of the index episode and the timing of relapses/recurrences were examined using a life chart. RESULTS: The median length of time that patients met full criteria for a major depressive episode was 1.5 (95 \ \% \ CL = 1.3 to 1.7) months, and the median time to full remission was 8.1 (95 \ \% \ CL = 5.2 to 11.0) months after entry. During the follow-up, 38 \ \% \ of patients had a recurrence. Although numerous factors predict outcome of MDD to some extent, severity of depression and current comorbidity were the 2 most important predictors of longer episode duration and recurrence. CONCLUSION: The course of MDD in modern psychiatric settings remains unfavorable. Any estimates of duration of depressive episodes and rates of recurrence are likely to be dependent on the severity of depression and level of comorbidity. At least among a population of mostly outpatients with MDD in medium-term follow-up, severity of depression and comorbidity appear to be more useful predictors of recurrence than does the number of prior episodes. These factors should influence clinical decision-making regarding the need for maintenance therapy.",2004.0,,6SHZNRNV,1,personality,998.0
17,16,Comparing chronic interpersonal and noninterpersonal stress domains as predictors of depression recurrence in emerging adults.,"Sheets, Erin S.; Craighead, W. Edward","Understanding how persistent interpersonal difficulties distinctly affect the course of major depressive disorder (MDD) during emerging adulthood is critical, given that early experiences impact future coping resources and functioning. Research on stress and MDD has mostly concentrated on stressful life events, while chronic stress largely has not been explored. The present study examined interpersonal (intimate relationship, close friendships, social life, family relationships) and noninterpersonal (academic, work, financial, personal health, and family members' health) domains of chronic stress as time-varying predictors of depressive recurrence in emerging adults. Baseline assessments identified previously depressed emerging adults (N = 119), who subsequently completed 6-month, 12-month and 18-month follow-up interviews to determine chronic stress experiences and onset of new major depressive episodes. Survival analyses indicated that time-varying total chronic stress and chronic interpersonal stress predicted higher risk for depression recurrence; however, chronic noninterpersonal stress was not associated with recurrence. Intimate relationship stress, close friendship stress, family relationship stress, personal health, and family members' health independently predicted MDD recurrence, over and above well-established depression risk factors of dysfunctional cognitions and personality disorder symptoms. Evidence that interpersonal stress could have substantial impact on course of depression is consistent with theories of emerging adulthood, a time when young people are individuating from the family and experiencing significant social transition.

The major vehicle for treatment is an explicit educational experience that addresses several target areas, including social skills, thought patterns, pleasant activities, and relaxation. The theoretical background and foundation on which CWD is based is discussed; the CWD course is described, focusing on selection of participants and course leaders; and the efficacy of CWD is noted, citing several treatment outcome studies. Seven variables are identified that account for outcome variance beyond that explained by pretreatment depression level: expected improvement, satisfaction with major life roles, concurrent treatment, perceived social support from family members, physical problems, suicidal attempts, and perceived mastery. Long-term follow-up and prediction of relapse are addressed. Modifications of the CWD course have also been successfully developed for depressed elderly populations, outpatients who failed to respond to antidepressant medication, and high school students (aged 14-28 yrs).
