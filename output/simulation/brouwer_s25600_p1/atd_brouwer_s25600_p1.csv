23,22,Extreme response style and symptom return after depression treatment: The role of positive extreme responding.,"Forand, Nicholas R.; DeRubeis, Robert J.","Objective: Evidence linking extreme response style (ER) to depressive relapse has been mixed. One reason might be high levels of extreme responses that are positive in nature (ER-Ps) compared with those negative in nature (ER-Ns) at posttreatment. ER-Ps likely consist of both maladaptive style responses and adaptive content responses (i.e., legitimate denials of dysfunction). The composition of ER-Ps might confound measures of total extreme responding as well as conventional scores on cognitive questionnaires. In the current study, we assessed ER in a new sample by (a) disambiguating ER-Ps that reflect style from those that reflect content and (b) assessing the contribution of ER-Ps to the prediction of relapse/recurrence. Method: Responders (N = 104) to a randomized controlled trial of cognitive therapy versus medications for moderate to severe depression had an average age of 40 years (SD = 12), and they were 58 \% female, 38 \% married/cohabitating, and 85 \% Caucasian. ER variables were calculated using the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale (DAS; Weissman, 1979), with ER-Ps categorized as either content or style responses. ER indices and DAS scores were used to predict symptom return over 2 years. Results: No standard extreme responding variables (e.g., an index of total extreme responding) predicted symptom return, but higher relative levels of style ER-P predicted relapse/recurrence. Total DAS scores also predicted relapse/recurrence but only when high levels of style ER-P responses were controlled. Conclusions: ER-Ps, at least on the DAS, appear to contain indicators of both adaptive and maladaptive positive responses. Future research should attend to the valence of the extreme responses as well as to the content of extreme positive responses, which may reflect either healthy or unhealthy tendencies.

21,20,Investigating associations between cortisol and cognitive reactivity to sad mood provocation and the prediction of relapse in remitted major depression.,"Chopra, K. K.; Segal, Z. V.; Buis, T.; Kennedy, S. H.; Levitan, R. D.","Overview: In remitted depressed patients, an increase in dysfunctional thoughts following a sad mood induction can predict relapse over 18 months. The current analysis examined whether salivary cortisol levels could also predict relapse in these same individuals. Method: 99 subjects with major depression were first treated to full remission using either antidepressant medication or cognitive behavioural therapy. While in the remitted state, subjects were exposed to sad music to trigger dysfunctional thoughts. In a subset of 55 subjects, salivary cortisol levels taken before and after the mood challenge were also obtained. Results: Unexpectedly, cortisol levels tended to decrease rather than increase following the mood challenge, suggesting that anticipation of the mood challenge was more stressful than the challenge itself. We thus used pre-challenge cortisol levels as the main grouping variable. Based on Kaplan-Meier survival curves, among subjects with low pre-challenge cortisol levels, those with a history of three or more prior episodes had significantly higher rates of relapse than did subjects with two or less prior episodes. In subjects with high pre-challenge cortisol levels, there was no significant difference in rates of relapse based on the number of prior episodes. Conclusion: In depressed patients with few prior episodes, assessing risk of relapse and thus establishing the duration for treatment can be a difficult clinical problem. Pending replication, the current results suggest that high anticipatory cortisol levels may have utility in predicting relapse even in patients with few prior episodes.

33,32,Cognitive Reactivity to Sad Mood Provocation and the Prediction of Depressive Relapse.,"Segal, Zindel V.; Kennedy, Sidney; Gemar, Michael; Hood, Karyn; Pedersen, Rebecca; Buis, Tom","Context: Episode remission in unipolar major depression, while distinguished by minimal symptom burden, can also be a period of marked sensitivity to emotional stress as well as an increased risk of relapse. Objective: To examine whether mood-linked changes in dysfunctional thinking predict relapse in recovered patients who were depressed. Design: In phase 1 of this study, patients with major depressive disorder were randomly assigned to receive either antidepressant medication or cognitive behavior therapy. In phase 2, patients who achieved clinical remission underwent sad mood provocation and were then observed with regular clinical assessments for 18 months. Setting: Outpatient psychiatric clinics at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Ontario. Participants: A total of 301 outpatients with major depressive disorder, aged 18 to 65 years, participated in phase 1 of this study and 99 outpatients with major depressive disorder in remission, aged 18 to 65 years, participated in phase 2. Main Outcome Measure: Occurrence of a relapse meeting DSM-IV criteria for a major depressive episode as assessed by the longitudinal interval follow-up evaluation and a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score of 16 or greater. Results: Patients who recovered through antidepressant medication showed greater cognitive reactivity following the mood provocation than those who received cognitive behavior therapy. Regardless of type of prior treatment, the magnitude of mood-linked cognitive reactivity was a significant predictor of relapse over the subsequent 18 months. Patients whose mood-linked endorsement of dysfunctional attitudes increased by a minimum of 8 points had a significantly shorter time to relapse than those whose scores were not as elevated. Conclusions: The vulnerability of remitted depressed patients for illness relapse may be related to the (re)activation of depressive thinking styles triggered by temporary dysphoric states. This is the first study to link such differences to prognosis following successful treatment for depression. Further understanding of factors predisposing to relapse/recurrence in recovered patients may help to shorten the potentially lifelong course of depression.

25,24,Differential predictors of response to preventive cognitive therapy in recurrent depression: a 2-year prospective study.,"Bockting, Claudi L. H.; Spinhoven, Philip; Koeter, Maarten W. J.; Wouters, Luuk F.; Visser, Ieke; Schene, Aart H.","BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder is a recurrent disease. Brief cognitive therapy (CT), added to either regular care or medication, is helpful in preventing relapse/recurrence. Little is known which type of persons benefit from preventive CT, the so called 'aptitude treatment interaction' effect. METHOD: The present cohort included exclusively patients with at least two previous episodes remitted on various types of treatments (n = 172). They were assessed within a clinical trial comparing treatment as usual (TAU) with preventive CT added to TAU. Differential demographic, illness-related, psychological and biological risk factors in postponing recurrence by preventive CT were examined. RESULTS: Significant aptitude-treatment-interaction effects were found for the number of previous episodes, daily hassles and life events, avoidant coping, gender, and morning cortisol levels. Preventive CT seemed ineffective in patients with life events (as more frequently reported by women in our study) and in patients with high episode number characterized by higher levels of avoidant coping. Generic predictors indicate that in CT, as in TAU, patients with more residual depressive symptomatology and higher levels of dysfunctional attitudes profit less from preventive CT. CONCLUSION: The finding that preventive CT protects against the influence of a consistently found risk factor of relapse/recurrence, i.e. the number of depressive episodes, underlines the potential of psychological preventive interventions. Preventive CT seemed to be especially effective in reducing presumably internally provoked, relapse/recurrence but may be quite ineffective in reducing externally provoked relapse/recurrence. CT possibly prevents either stress generation or disrupts kindling effects. Kindling effects probably cannot be disrupted in patients with higher levels of avoidant coping who experienced a high number of episodes, and patients who experienced life events.",2006.0,10.1159/000092893,XLUBYWNU,1,cognitive,229.0
34,33,Prevention of Relapse/Recurrence in Major Depressive Disorder With Either Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy or Cognitive Therapy,"Farb, N.; Anderson, A.; Ravindran, A.; Hawley, L.; Irving, J.; Mancuso, E.; Gulamani, T.; Williams, G.; Ferguson, A.; Segal, Z. V.","Objective: Both Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Cognitive Therapy (CT) enhance self‐management of prodromal symptoms associated with depressive relapse, albeit through divergent therapeutic procedures. We evaluated rates of relapse in remitted depressed patients receiving MBCT and CT. Decentering and dysfunctional attitudes were assessed as treatment‐specific process markers. Method: Participants in remission from Major Depressive Disorder (MDD; N = 166) were randomized to 8 weeks of either MBCT (N = 82) or CT (N = 84) and were followed for 24 months, with process markers measured every 3 months. Attendance in both treatments was high (6.3/8 session) and treatment fidelity and competence were evaluated. Relapse was defined as a return of symptoms meeting the criteria for major depression on Module A of the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (SCID). Results: Intention‐to‐treat analyses indicated no differences between MBCT and CT in either rates of relapse to MDD or time to relapse across 24 months of follow up. Both groups experienced significant increases in decentering and participants in CT reported greater reductions in dysfunctional attitudes. Within both treatments, participants who relapsed evidenced lower decentering scores than those who stayed well over the follow up. Conclusions: This is the first study to directly compare relapse prophylaxis following MBCT and CT directly. The lack of group differences in time to relapse supports the view that both interventions are equally effective and that increases in decentering achieved via either treatment are associated with greater protection. These findings lend credence to Teasdale et al.'s (2002) contention that, even though they may be taught through dissimilar methods, CT and MBCT help participants develop similar metacognitive skills for the regulation of distressing thoughts and emotions.

30,29,Initial Steps to inform selection of continuation cognitive therapy or fluoxetine for higher risk responders to cognitive therapy for recurrent major depressive disorder,"Vittengl, J. R.; Anna Clark, L.; Thase, M. E.; Jarrett, R. B.","Responders to acute‐phase cognitive therapy (A‐CT) for major depressive disorder (MDD) often relapse or recur, but continuation‐phase cognitive therapy (C‐CT) or fluoxetine reduces risks for some patients. We tested composite moderators of C‐CT versus fluoxetine's preventive effects to inform continuation treatment selection. Responders to A‐CT for MDD judged to be at higher risk for relapse due to unstable or partial remission (N=172) were randomized to 8 months of C‐CT or fluoxetine with clinical management and assessed, free from protocol treatment, for 24 additional months. Pre‐continuation‐treatment characteristics that in survival analyses moderated treatments' effects on relapse over 8 months of continuation‐phase treatment (residual symptoms and negative temperament) and on relapse/recurrence over the full observation period's 32 months (residual symptoms and age) were combined to estimate the potential advantage of C‐CT versus fluoxetine for individual patients. Assigning patients to optimal continuation treatment (i.e., to C‐CT or fluoxetine, depending on patients' pre‐continuation‐treatment characteristics) resulted in absolute reduction of relapse or recurrence risk by 16‐21% compared to the other non‐optimal treatment. Although these novel results require replication before clinical application, selecting optimal continuation treatment (i.e., personalizing treatment) for higher risk A‐CT responders may decrease risks of MDD relapse and recurrence substantively.",2017.0,10.1016/j.psychres.2017.03.032,ESDSJLZY,1,additional,259.0

S.","Background: To investigate whether usage of treatment-acquired regulatory skills is associated with prevention of depressive relapse/recurrence. Method: Remitted depressed outpatients entered a 24-month clinical follow up after either 8 weekly group sessions of cognitive therapy (CT; N = 84) or mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT; N = 82). The primary outcome was symptom return meeting the criteria for major depression on Module A of the SCID. Results: Factor analysis identified three latent factors (53% of the variance): decentering (DC), distress tolerance (DT), and residual symptoms (RS), which were equivalent across CT and MBCT. Latent change score modeling of factor slopes over the follow up revealed positive slopes for DC (beta = .177), and for DT (beta = .259), but not for RS (beta = -.017), indicating posttreatment growth in DC and DT, but no change in RS. Cox regression indicated that DC slope was a significant predictor of relapse/recurrence prophylaxis, Hazard Ratio (HR) = .232 90% Confidence Interval (CI) [.067, .806], controlling for past depressive episodes, treatment group, and medication. The practice of therapy-acquired regulatory skills had no direct effect on relapse/recurrence (beta = .028) but predicted relapse/recurrence through an indirect path (beta = -.125), such that greater practice of regulatory skills following treatment promoted increases in DC (beta = .462), which, in turn, predicted a reduced risk of relapse/recurrence over 24 months (beta = -.270). Conclusions: Preventing major depressive disorder relapse/recurrence may depend upon developing DC in addition to managing residual symptoms. Following the acquisition of therapy skills during maintenance psychotherapies, DC is strengthened by continued skill utilization beyond treatment termination.

A total of 109 inpatients with MDD participated in this study. The subjects completed the TCI when they were assessed to be in remission. They were divided into high or low HA groups and high or low SD groups, as discriminated by the quartile value. A total of 69 patients were followed-up over a 4-year period or until recurrence. Both Kaplan-Meier analysis and Coxs proportional hazards regression analysis indicated that patients with a low SD score had a significantly shorter time to recurrence from remission than patients with a high SD score even when some prognostic predictors were controlled for. In contrast, HA was not found to be a predictor of recurrence for future depressive episodes.

Clinical characteristics such as residual symptoms have been shown to negatively affect the long-term course of MDD. However, it is unclear so far how trait repetitive negative thinking (RNT) as well as cognitive and affective momentary states, the latter experienced during daily-life, affect the long-term course of MDD. METHOD: We followed up 57 remitted depressed (rMDD) individuals six (T2) and 36 (T3) months after baseline. Clinical outcomes were time to relapse, time spent with significant symptoms as a marker of chronicity, and levels of depressive symptoms at T2 and T3. Predictors assessed at baseline included residual symptoms and trait RNT. Furthermore, momentary daily life affect and momentary rumination, and their variation over the day were assessed at baseline using ambulatory assessment (AA). RESULTS: In multiple models, residual symptoms and instability of daily-life affect at baseline independently predicted a faster time to relapse, while chronicity was significantly predicted by trait RNT. Multilevel models revealed that depressive symptom levels during follow-up were predicted by baseline residual symptom levels and by instability of daily-life rumination. Both instability features were linked to a higher number of anamnestic MDD episodes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that trait RNT, but also affective and cognitive processes during daily life impact the longer-term course of MDD. Future longitudinal research on the role of respective AA-phenotypes as potential transdiagnostic course-modifiers is warranted.",2017.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0178759,LKYETG4X,1,additional,578.0
4,3,How does cognitive therapy prevent relapse in residual depression?

Scores based on agreement with item content of 5 questionnaires of depression-related cognition provided no evidence for cognitive mediation. A measure of the form of response to those questionnaires, the number of times patients used extreme response categories ( totally agree and totally disagree ), showed significant and substantial prediction of relapse, differential response to CT, and conformity to mediational criteria. CT reduced relapse through reductions in absolutist, dichotomous thinking style. CT may prevent relapse by training patients to change the way that they process depression-related material rather than by changing belief in depressive thought content.

19,18,Repetitive negative thinking as a predictor of depression and anxiety: A longitudinal cohort study,"Spinhoven, Philip; van Hemert, Albert M.; Penninx, Brenda W.","Background: Repetitive Negative Thinking (RNT) is assumed to be a transdiagnostic proximal risk factor in depression and anxiety. We examined the prospective relations of disorder-dependent as well as disorder-independent measures of RNT with depression and anxiety outcomes. Methods: In a prospective cohort study, 1972 adults completed a 3-year follow-up period (attrition = 12.6%). DSM-IV diagnoses were assessed with the CIDI, symptom severity with the IDS and BAI, and RNT with measures for perseverative thinking (PTQ), rumination (LEIDS-R) and worry (PWQ). Results: The common dimension of our RNT measurements (according to Confirmatory Factor Analysis) was significantly associated with comorbidity among depressive and among anxiety disorders, severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as persistence and relapse of depressive and anxiety disorders. Additionally, a specific factor for rumination predicted comorbidity of depressive disorders, comorbidity of anxiety disorders and relapse of depressive disorder, while a specific factor for worry predicted comorbidity of anxiety disorders and relapse of anxiety disorders, although to a lesser extent than general RNT. Limitations: The present study relied solely on self-report measures of RNT and controlling for baseline demographic and clinical variables greatly attenuated the predictive value of RNT. Discussion: Disorder-independent RNT may be a similar underlying process present across depressive and anxiety disorders. It seems more important than the representation of this process in disorder-specific cognitive content such as rumination in depression and worry in anxiety. RNT as a pathological trait deserves more attention in clinical diagnosis and the transdiagnostic treatment of comorbid depression and anxiety in particular.

27,26,Personality and cognitive vulnerability in remitted recurrently depressed patients.,"van Rijsbergen, Gerard D.; Kok, Gemma D.; Elgersma, Hermien J.; Hollon, Steven D.; Bockting, Claudi L. H.","INTRODUCTION: Personality disorders (PDs) have been associated with a poor prognosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The aim of the current study was to examine cognitive vulnerability (i.e., dysfunctional beliefs, extremity of beliefs, cognitive reactivity, and rumination) that might contribute to this poor prognosis of patients with PD comorbidity. METHODS: 309 outpatients with remitted recurrent MDD (SCID-I; HAM-D17 \textless /= 10) were included within two comparable RCTs and were assessed at baseline with the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-4(+) (PDQ-4(+)), the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale Version-A (DAS-A), the Leiden Index of Depression Sensitivity (LEIDS), the Ruminative Response Scale (RRS), and the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (IDS-SR). RESULTS: We found an indication that the PD prevalence was 49.5 \% in this remitted recurrently depressed sample. Having a PD (and higher levels of personality pathology) was associated with dysfunctional beliefs, cognitive reactivity, and rumination. Extreme 'black and white thinking' on the DAS was not associated with personality pathology. Brooding was only associated with a Cluster C classification (t(308) = 4.03, p \textless .001) and with avoidant PD specifically (t(308) = 4.82, p \textless .001), while surprisingly not with obsessive-compulsive PD. LIMITATIONS: PDs were assessed by questionnaire and the analyses were cross-sectional in nature. CONCLUSION: Being the first study to examine cognitive reactivity and rumination in patients with PD and remitted MDD, we demonstrated that even after controlling for depressive symptomatology, dysfunctional beliefs, cognitive reactivity, and rumination were associated with personality pathology. Rumination might be a pathway to relapse for patients with avoidant PD.

Although baseline dysfunctional attitudes predicted an episode of major depression over 3 years of prospective study, this prediction, considered alone or in interaction with negative life events, was redundant with that offered by history of past depression.

A battery of tests was completed by 158 students, and a subset (n =102) was reached approximately 20 months later for the assessment of new depressive onsets. Self-criticism and neuroticism were uniquely associated with a past history of depression, and self-criticism and immature dependence interacted in predicting past occurrences of depression. Self-criticism was increasingly associated with past depressive episodes as level of immature dependence increased. The interaction of immature dependence and self-criticism was also evident in predicting future occurrence of depression after controlling statistically for the effects of current symptoms, neuroticism, certain Axis II diagnoses, and number of previous depressive episodes. This interactive effect suggests that individuals with high levels of both self-criticism and immature dependence are particularly prone to depressive episodes.",2006.0,10.1002/jclp.20263,IXTYMFJG,1,personality,955.0

OBJECTIVE: To separate postmorbid vulnerability into (1) trait effects (ie, the continuation of premorbid vulnerability); (2) state effects of subthreshold (residual) symptoms on personality or its perception; and/or (3) scar effects (ie, negative personality change that develops during an MDE and persists beyond MDE remission). METHODS: Data come from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study, a prospective Dutch psychiatric population-based survey. We obtained psychiatric (Composite International Diagnostic Interview) and personality data on neuroticism, depressive coping style, self-esteem, and mastery from 4796 respondents at 3 time points (T1, T2, and T3), 12 and 24 months apart. Between- and within-subjects differences were tested with repeated-measures analysis of variance and adjusted for sex, age, and time. RESULTS: After T1, 409 respondents developed an MDE, of whom 334 were MDE-free at T3. In comparison with individuals without any lifetime MDE, the 262 subjects with a first MDE had higher premorbid T1 vulnerability scores on each personality measure (0.38-0.83 effect size units). During the MDE, vulnerability scores further increased (0.33-0.52 effect size units) but returned to premorbid levels after MDE remission. We found no scar effects among subgroups with severe or long-lasting MDEs. Subthreshold residual symptoms at T3 biased comparisons between T1 and T3 if the premorbid period of T1 to MDE onset was longer than the postmorbid period of MDE remission to T3, misleadingly suggesting scar effects. We obtained similar results in the 147 subjects with recurrent MDEs. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of a negative change from premorbid to postmorbid assessment for any of the personality traits. Postmorbid vulnerability reflected the continuation of premorbid vulnerability. Pre-post MDE comparisons are sensitive to prodromal and residual symptoms. Our findings suggest 2 independent simultaneous processes: (1) the ongoing expression of vulnerability as a personality deviance; and (2) synchrony of change between severity of depressive symptoms and personality deviance.",2004.0,10.1001/archpsyc.61.10.990,KYPB9HTF,1,cognitive,998.0

7,6,An evaluation of an integrated model of relapse in depression.,"Backs-Dermott, Barbara J.; Dobson, Keith S.; Jones, Shannon L.","BACKGROUND AND AIM: The present study evaluated an integrated model of the role of psychosocial factors in the prediction of relapse of Major Depressive Disorder over a one-year follow-up period. METHODS AND ANALYSES: A range of established variables, including life stress, cognitive-personality vulnerability factors, social support, and coping responses, were simultaneously considered in a series of prediction models, in an adult female sample of remitted depressed individuals. RESULTS: It was determined that interpersonal marked difficulties, social support, and emotion-oriented and avoidance-oriented coping provided the best-fitting and most parsimonious predictive model for depressive relapse at one-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The examination of multifactorial models of risk represents a promising avenue for future research and theory development.",2010.0,10.1016/j.jad.2009.11.015,2SBHSG6Y,1,cognitive,1058.0
20,19,Psychosocial predictors of the short-term course and outcome of major depression: A longitudinal study of a nonclinical sample with recent-onset episodes.,"Lara, Maria Elena; Klein, Daniel N.; Kasch, Karen L.","Three variables have been hypothesized to play important roles in prolonging the course of depressive episodes: a ruminative response style, significant interpersonal relationships, and childhood adversity. The authors examined whether these variables predicted the short-term course of major depressive disorder (MDD). Participants (n/ \& =/ \& 84) were college students with a recent-onset major depressive episode. Assessments included several interview and self-report measures, and data on interpersonal relationships were obtained from close confidants. Follow-up interviews were conducted 6 mo later. After controlling for baseline severity, harsh discipline in childhood significantly predicted mean level of depression across the follow-up and level of depression at follow-up. Harsh discipline was also significantly associated with relapse but not with recovery. After controlling for baseline severity, rumination and the interpersonal variables did not predict the outcome of MDD.

Shapiro and M. Keller (unpublished), with 113 19-60 yr old unipolar depressives who had completed a cognitive-behavioral intervention in an examination of 1- to 3-yr outcomes and risk factors for relapse. Ss were administered the Beck Depression Inventory, the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, and a life satisfaction scale. 59, 28, and 26 Ss were assigned to major depressive, intermittent depressive, and double depressive categories, respectively, according to pretreatment symptomatology and the Research Diagnostic Criteria. Results indicate that the recovery rate of the major depressives (75 \% ) was significantly higher than that of the intermittent depressives (43 \% ) or that of the superimposed depressives (27 \% ). Significant predictors of relapse, accounting for 38 \% of the variance, included the number of previous episodes of depression, family history, poor health, history of depression in 1st-degree relatives, dissatisfaction with major life roles, depression level at entry to the study, and age.

17,16,Comparing chronic interpersonal and noninterpersonal stress domains as predictors of depression recurrence in emerging adults.,"Sheets, Erin S.; Craighead, W. Edward","Understanding how persistent interpersonal difficulties distinctly affect the course of major depressive disorder (MDD) during emerging adulthood is critical, given that early experiences impact future coping resources and functioning. Research on stress and MDD has mostly concentrated on stressful life events, while chronic stress largely has not been explored. The present study examined interpersonal (intimate relationship, close friendships, social life, family relationships) and noninterpersonal (academic, work, financial, personal health, and family members' health) domains of chronic stress as time-varying predictors of depressive recurrence in emerging adults. Baseline assessments identified previously depressed emerging adults (N = 119), who subsequently completed 6-month, 12-month and 18-month follow-up interviews to determine chronic stress experiences and onset of new major depressive episodes. Survival analyses indicated that time-varying total chronic stress and chronic interpersonal stress predicted higher risk for depression recurrence; however, chronic noninterpersonal stress was not associated with recurrence. Intimate relationship stress, close friendship stress, family relationship stress, personal health, and family members' health independently predicted MDD recurrence, over and above well-established depression risk factors of dysfunctional cognitions and personality disorder symptoms. Evidence that interpersonal stress could have substantial impact on course of depression is consistent with theories of emerging adulthood, a time when young people are individuating from the family and experiencing significant social transition.

22,21,Factors predicting the long-term illness course in a cohort of depressed inpatients.,"Kuehner, Christine; Huffziger, Silke","Depressed psychiatric inpatients show particularly high rates of recurrence and chronicity. To identify predictors of their long-term illness course is of high importance for tertiary prevention. We followed up 68 unipolarly depressed psychiatric inpatients 1, 6, 42, and 66 months after discharge. Outcomes included time spent in episodes, time to relapse/recurrence, and psychosocial functioning during the prospective 5.5-year interval. Predictors included demographic, clinical, cognitive vulnerability, and social support variables assessed at baseline. During the total observation period, 12 \% of patients spent \textless 50 \% of time in remission, and 55 \% of those remitted at post-discharge baseline suffered a relapse or recurrence. Mean psychosocial functioning was below normal functioning at all assessments. Depression levels after discharge and unsatisfactory relationships within the support network predicted all outcomes. Furthermore, early onset, longer episode duration prior to study entry, and state orientation predicted time spent in episodes. Further predictors of time to recurrence included number of previous hospitalizations and lack of psychotherapy after discharge. Long-term psychosocial functioning was additionally predicted by previous hospitalizations, duration of index episode, and state orientation. Our results demonstrate a highly recurrent and chronic illness course in depressed psychiatric inpatients. Identified predictors point to the need of treating depressive episodes to full remission. Psychological interventions should explicitly address patients' interpersonal needs and possible deficits.",2013.0,10.1007/s00406-012-0379-7,WAMN8PCN,1,cognitive,1370.0
11,10,Prediction of the three-year course of recurrent depression in primary care patients: Different risk factors for different outcomes,"Conradi, Henk Jan; de Jonge, Peter; Ormel, Johan","Background The objectives of this study are: (1) identification of predictors for the three-year course of recurrent depression in the rarely studied, but relevant sample of primary care patients, and (2) investigation whether different outcome indicators, time to recurrence, proportion depression-free time and mean severity of depressive symptoms during follow-up, are associated with different risk factors. Methods Depression course was established by assessing 110 patients three-monthly with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview and the BDI, during a three-year period. Eight (groups of) predictors, assessed at baseline, were examined: socio-demographics, parental depression, history and severity of depression, anxiety, coping potential, social dysfunctioning and physical functioning. Results Time to recurrence was predicted by number of previous episodes (OR=1.91). Both proportion depressive disorder-free time and mean depression severity during follow-up were predicted by: severity of depression (B=−.19 and .21 respectively), anxiety (B=−.32 and .33), social dysfunctioning (B=−.21 and .22) and physical functioning (B=.24 and −.39). Mean severity was additionally predicted by: educational level (B=−.21), duration of the longest prior episode (B=.32), and coping potential (B=−.40). Coping potential and number of previous episodes were marginally significant predictors for all three outcomes. Limitations Although substantial, sample size was restricted. Conclusion Different outcome variables are predicted by different risk factors. Restriction to one outcome may lead to missing important determinants of the depression course. Number of prior episodes and coping potential seem to warrant special attention from the GP.",2008.0,10.1016/j.jad.2007.04.017,4FARZIFW,1,missing,1372.0
15,14,Recurrence of major depressive disorder and its predictors in the general population: results from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS).,"Hardeveld, F.; Spijker, J. and","BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the risk of recurrence after recovery from major depressive disorder (MDD) in the general population is scarce. METHOD: Data were derived from 687 subjects in the general population with a lifetime DSM-III-R diagnosis of MDD but without a current major depressive episode (MDE) or dysthymia. Participants had to be at least 6 months in remission, and were recruited from The Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS), using the composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI). Recency and severity of the last MDE were assessed retrospectively at baseline. Recurrence of MDD was measured prospectively during the 3-year follow-up. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to measure time to recurrence. Determinants of time to recurrence were analyzed using proportional hazard models. RESULTS: The estimated cumulative recurrence of MDD was 13.2 \ \% \ at 5 years, 23.2 \ \% \ at 10 years and 42.0 \ \% \ at 20 years. In bivariate analysis, the following variables predicted a shorter time to recurrence: younger age, younger age of onset, higher number of previous episodes, a severe last depressive episode, negative youth experiences, ongoing difficulties before recurrence and high neuroticism. Multivariably, younger age, a higher number of previous episodes, a severe last depressive episode, negative youth experiences and ongoing difficulties remained significant. CONCLUSIONS: In this community sample, the long-term risk of recurrence was high, but lower than that found in clinical samples. Subjects who had had an MDE had a long-term vulnerability for recurrence. Factors predicting recurrence included illness- and stress-related factors.",2013.0,10.1017/S0033291712002395,WP4DWLKK,1,personality,1378.0
10,9,Personality and social support as predictors of first and recurrent episodes of depression.,"Noteboom, Annemieke; Beekman, Aartjan T. F.; Vogelzangs, Nicole; Penninx, Brenda W. J. H.","BACKGROUND: Depression is a prevalent psychiatric disorder with high personal and public health consequences, partly due to a high risk of recurrence. This longitudinal study examines personality traits, structural and subjective social support dimensions as predictors of first and recurrent episodes of depression in initially non-depressed subjects. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). 1085 respondents without a current depression or anxiety diagnosis were included. 437 respondents had a prior history of depression, 648 did not. Personality dimensions were measured with the NEO-FFI, network size, partner-status, negative and positive emotional support were measured with the Close Person Questionnaire. Logistic regression analyses (unadjusted and adjusted for clinical variables and sociodemographic variables) examined whether these psychosocial variables predict a new episode of depression at two year follow up and whether this differed among persons with or without a history of depression. RESULTS: In the unadjusted analyses high extraversion (OR:.93, 95 \ \% \ CI (.91-.96), P \ \textless \ .001), agreeableness (OR:.94, 95 \ \% \ CI (.90-.97), P \ \textless \ .001), conscientiousness (OR:.93, 95 \ \% \ CI (.90-.96), P \ \textless \ .001) and a larger network size (OR:.76, 95 \ \% \ CI (.64-.90), P=.001) significantly reduced the risk of a new episode of depression. Only neuroticism predicted a new episode of depression in both the unadjusted (OR:1.13, 95 \ \% \ CI (1.10-1.15), P \ \textless \ .001) and adjusted analyses (OR:1.06, 95 \ \% \ CI (1.03-1.10), P \ \textless \ .001). None of the predictors predicted first or recurrent episodes of depression differently. LIMITATIONS: we used a relatively short follow up period and broad personality dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: Neuroticism seems to predict both first and recurrent episodes of depression and may be suitable for screening for preventive interventions.",2016.0,10.1016/j.jad.2015.09.020,LUHSYTDF,1,personality,1405.0
5,4,Severity and comorbidity predict episode duration and recurrence of DSM-IV major depressive disorder.,"Melartin, Tarja K.; Rytsala, Heikki J.; Leskela, Ulla S.; Lestela-Mielonen, Paula S.; Sokero, T. Petteri; Isometsa, Erkki T.","BACKGROUND: Information on the naturalistic outcome of major depressive disorder (MDD) is important in developing rational clinical practices. The aim of this study was to determine the outcome of MDD in a modern secondary-level psychiatric setting and the influence of comorbidity plus psychosocial factors on the outcome of MDD. METHOD: The Vantaa Depression Study is a prospective, naturalistic cohort study of 269 secondary-level care psychiatric outpatients and inpatients diagnosed with a new episode of DSM-IV MDD. Patients were initially interviewed to determine the presence of MDD using the World Health Organization Schedule for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry and to assess Axis II diagnoses using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R personality disorders between February 1, 1997, and May 31, 1998, and were interviewed again at 6 months and 18 months. The exact duration of the index episode and the timing of relapses/recurrences were examined using a life chart. RESULTS: The median length of time that patients met full criteria for a major depressive episode was 1.5 (95 \ \% \ CL = 1.3 to 1.7) months, and the median time to full remission was 8.1 (95 \ \% \ CL = 5.2 to 11.0) months after entry. During the follow-up, 38 \ \% \ of patients had a recurrence. Although numerous factors predict outcome of MDD to some extent, severity of depression and current comorbidity were the 2 most important predictors of longer episode duration and recurrence. CONCLUSION: The course of MDD in modern psychiatric settings remains unfavorable. Any estimates of duration of depressive episodes and rates of recurrence are likely to be dependent on the severity of depression and level of comorbidity. At least among a population of mostly outpatients with MDD in medium-term follow-up, severity of depression and comorbidity appear to be more useful predictors of recurrence than does the number of prior episodes. These factors should influence clinical decision-making regarding the need for maintenance therapy.",2004.0,,6SHZNRNV,1,personality,1558.0
32,31,Long-term outcome of major depressive disorder in psychiatric patients is variable.,"Holma, K. Mikael; Holma, Irina A. K.; Melartin, Tarja K.; Rytsala, Heikki J.; Isometsa, Erkki T.","Objective: The prevailing view of outcome of major depressive disorder (MDD), based on mostly inpatient cohorts sampled from tertiary centers, emphasizes chronicity and frequent recurrences. We investigated the long-term outcome of a regionally representative psychiatric MDD cohort comprising mainly outpatients. Method: The Vantaa Depression Study included 163 patients with DSM-IV MDD (71.5 \% of those eligible) diagnosed using structured and semistructured interviews and followed up at 6 months, 18 months, and 5 years with a life chart between February 1, 1997, and April 30, 2004. The effects of comorbid disorders and other predictors on outcome were comprehensively investigated. Results: Over the 5-year follow-up, 98.8 \% of patients achieved a symptom state below major depressive episode (MDE) criteria, and 88.4 \% reached full remission, with the median time to full remission being 11.0 months. Nearly one third (29.3 \% ) had no recurrences, whereas 30.0 \% experienced 1, 12.9 \% experienced 2, and 27.9 \% experienced 3 or more recurrences. Preceding dysthymic disorder (p = .028), cluster C personality disorder (p = .041), and longer MDE duration prior to entry (p = .011) were the most significant predictors of longer time in achieving full remission. Severity of MDD and comorbidity, especially social phobia, predicted probability of, shorter time to, and number of recurrences. Conclusion: Previous literature on mostly inpatient MDD may have, by generalizing from patients with the most severe psychopathology, overemphasized chronicity of MDD. The long-term outcome of MDD in psychiatric care is variable, with about one tenth of patients having poor, one third having intermediate, and one half having favorable outcomes. In addition to known predictors,.cluster C personality disorders and social phobia warrant further attention as predictors of MDD outcome among outpatients.

A.; Luty, Suzanne E.; Joyce, Peter R.","BACKGROUND: The clinically relevant outcomes in treating depression are persistent recovery, relapse, and treatment resistance. METHOD: 175 outpatients treated with antidepressants for 6 months were assessed for major depression. Those who had recovered were prospectively monitored for one year to study rates of relapse (at least two weeks of major depression). Those who were depressed at 6 months were monitored for rates of recovery (at least 8 weeks of no major depression). RESULTS: 94 \ \% \ of the sample was monitored for one year. Of the 123 patients who were not depressed at 6 months 57 (46 \ \% \ ) relapsed. Patients who relapsed were more likely to have a history of recurrent depression, to have residual depressive symptoms, to have a less sustained response to initial treatment, to have avoidant personality disorder symptoms, schizotypal personality disorder symptoms, higher harm avoidance (HA) scores and lower self directedness (SD) scores. Of the 38 patients who were depressed at 6 months 13 (34 \ \% \ ) recovered. There were no patient characteristics associated with recovery. LIMITATIONS: The findings apply to moderately depressed outpatients. There was no placebo control. CONCLUSION: Most patients with depression will recover but many become unwell again within a year.

16,15,Group treatment of depressed individuals: The coping with depression course.,"Lewinsohn, Peter M.; Clarke, Gregory N.","Describes a coping-with-depression (CWD) course that is a multimodal, psychoeducational group treatment for unipolar depression. The major vehicle for treatment is an explicit educational experience that addresses several target areas, including social skills, thought patterns, pleasant activities, and relaxation. The theoretical background and foundation on which CWD is based is discussed; the CWD course is described, focusing on selection of participants and course leaders; and the efficacy of CWD is noted, citing several treatment outcome studies. Seven variables are identified that account for outcome variance beyond that explained by pretreatment depression level: expected improvement, satisfaction with major life roles, concurrent treatment, perceived social support from family members, physical problems, suicidal attempts, and perceived mastery. Long-term follow-up and prediction of relapse are addressed. Modifications of the CWD course have also been successfully developed for depressed elderly populations, outpatients who failed to respond to antidepressant medication, and high school students (aged 14-28 yrs).
