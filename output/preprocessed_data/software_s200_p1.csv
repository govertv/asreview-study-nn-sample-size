0,1,Using Developer Information as a Factor for Fault Prediction,"We have been investigating different prediction models to identify which files of a large multi-release industrial software system are most likely to contain the largest numbers of faults in the next release. To make predictions we considered a number of different file characteristics and change information about the files, and have built fully- automatable models that do not require that the user have any statistical expertise. We now consider the effect of adding developer information as a prediction factor and assess the extent to which this affects the quality of the predictions.",2007,1,
1,2,Reliability analysis of protective relays in fault information processing system in China,"The reliability indices of protective relays are first put forward in this paper. A Markov probability model is then established to evaluate the reliability of relay protection. With the state space analytical method, all the steady state probabilities and state transition probabilities can be calculated utilizing the data stored in the fault information processing system. We can get an equation that represents the influence of routine test intervals on relay unavailability. Based on this, the optimum routine test interval for protective relays can be determined.

The application of it to an actual power system in China proves the method to be correct and effective",2006,0,
2,3,Test effort optimization by prediction and ranking of fault-prone software modules,"Identification of fault-prone or not fault-prone modules is very essential to improve the reliability and quality of a software system. Once modules are categorized as fault-prone or not fault-prone, test effort are allocated accordingly. Testing effort and efficiency are primary concern and can be optimized by prediction and ranking of fault-prone modules. This paper discusses a new model for prediction and ranking of fault-prone software modules for test effort optimization. Model utilizes the classification capability of data mining techniques and knowledge stored in software metrics to classify the software module as fault-prone or not fault-prone. A decision tree is constructed using ID3 algorithm for the existing project data. Rules are derived form the decision tree and integrated with fuzzy inference system to classify the modules as either fault-prone or not fault-prone for the target data. The model is also able to rank the fault-prone module on the basis of its degree of fault-proneness. The model accuracy are validated and compared with some other models by using the NASA projects data set of PROMOSE repository.",2010,1,

6,7,Reduction of faults in software testing by fault domination,"Although mutation testing is one of the practical ways of enhancing test effectiveness in software testing, it could be sometimes infeasible in practical work for a large scale software so that the mutation testing becomes time-consuming and even in prohibited time. Therefore, the number of faults assumed to exist in the software under test should be reduced so as to be able to confine the time complexity of test within a reasonable period of time. This paper utilizes the concept of fault dominance and equivalence, which has long been employed in hardware testing, for revealing a novel way of reducing the number of faults assumed to hide in software systems. Once the number of faults assumed in software is decreased sharply, the effectiveness of mutation testing will be greatly enhanced and become a feasible way of software testing. Examples and experimental results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and the helpfulness of the technology proposed in the paper.",2007,0,

11,12,Fault detection in Flexible Assembly Systems using Petri net,"A significant part of the activities in a manufacturing system involve assembly tasks. Nowadays, these tasks are object of automation due to the market increasing demand for quality, productivity and variety of the products. Consequently, the automation of assembly systems should consider flexibility to face product diversification, functionalities, delivery times, and volumes involved.

In this paper we study different similarity coefficients that are applied in the context of a program spectral approach to software fault localization (single programming mistakes). The coefficients studied are taken from the systems diagnosis/automated debugging tools Pinpoint, Tarantula, and AMPLE, and from the molecular biology domain (the Ochiai coefficient). We evaluate these coefficients on the Siemens Suite of benchmark faults, and assess their effectiveness in terms of the position of the actual fault in the probability ranking of fault candidates produced by the diagnosis technique. Our experiments indicate that the Ochiai coefficient consistently outperforms the coefficients currently used by the tools mentioned. In terms of the amount of code that needs to be inspected, this coefficient improves 5% on average over the next best technique, and up to 30% in specific cases",2006,0,

15,16,The effect of registration error on tracking distant augmented objects,"We conducted a user study of the effect of registration error on performance of tracking distant objects in augmented reality. Categorizing error by types that are often used as specifications, we hoped to derive some insight into the ability of users to tolerate noise, latency, and orientation error. We used measurements from actual systems to derive the parameter settings. We expected all three errors to influence userspsila ability to perform the task correctly and the precision with which they performed the task. We found that high latency had a negative impact on both performance and response time. While noise consistently interacted with the other variables, and orientation error increased user error, the differences between ldquohighrdquo and ldquolowrdquo amounts were smaller than we expected. Results of userspsila subjective rankings of these three categories of error were surprisingly mixed. Users believed noise was the most detrimental, though statistical analysis of performance refuted this belief. We interpret the results and draw insights for system design.",2008,0,

A large number of bug reports are tossed (reassigned) to other developers, for example because the bugs have been assigned by mistake. The tossing events increase bug-fix time. In order to quickly identify the fixer to bug reports we present an approach based on the bug tossing history and textual similarities between bug reports.

18,19,Forward error protection for robust video streaming based on distributed video coding principles,"This paper proposes an error resilient coding scheme that employs distributed video coding tools. A bitstream, produced by any standard motion-compensated predictive codec (MPEG-x, H.26x), is sent over an error-prone channel. In addition, a Wyner-Ziv encoded auxiliary bitstream is sent as redundant information to serve as a forward error correction code. At the decoder side, error concealed reconstructed frames are used as side information by the Wyner-Ziv decoder, and the corrected frame is used as a reference by future frames, thus reducing drift. We explicitly target the problem of rate allocation at the encoder side, by estimating the channel induced distortion in the transform domain. Experimental results conducted over a simulated error-prone channel reveal that the proposed scheme has comparable or better performance than a scheme where forward error correction codes are used. Moreover the proposed solution shows good performance when compared to a scheme that uses the intra-macroblock refresh procedure.",2008,0,

22,23,Analysis of pressure and Blanchard altitude errors computed using atmospheric data obtained from an F-18 aircraft flight,"Pressure altitude is commonly utilized as an altitude reference for an inertial navigation system (INS) to damp the error growth in the inherently unstable vertical channel. A precise altitude reference for use in the INS vertical channel can be obtained using the Blanchard algorithm, which computes altitude from atmospheric pressure, temperature, aircraft ground velocity, and wind velocity data. This paper computes both the pressure and Blanchard altitudes for an entire test flight of an F-18 aircraft from the atmospheric data measured during the flight. The flight repeats 4 cycles of a climb, level-off, dive, level-off trajectory. The altitude computed from GPS during flight is considered to be the truth altitude. The errors in the pressure and Blanchard altitudes are computed and compared.

In this paper we derive the model equations for both the SOLT and SOLR calibration, the two cases do not result in the same model equation.

26,27,Using variable-length error-correcting codes in MPEG-4 video,Reversible variable length (RVL) codes are used in MPEG-4 video coding to improve its error resilience. Algorithms used to design variable-length error-correcting (VLEC) codes are modified so as to construct efficient RVL codes with a smaller average length than those found in the literature. It is also shown that RVL codes are a special (weak) class of VLEC codes. Consequently more powerful VLEC codes can be used in the MPEG-4 codec and it is shown that performance gains of up to 20 dB in peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) can be obtained using a soft-decision sequential decoder with relatively simple VLEC codes. This increase in performance is obtained at the expense of an order of magnitude increase in decoding complexity,2005,0,
27,28,Restoration of Directional Overcurrent Relay Coordination in Distributed Generation Systems Utilizing Fault Current Limiter,"A new approach is proposed to solve the directional overcurrent relay coordination problem, which arises from installing distributed generation (DG) in looped power delivery systems (PDS). This approach involves the implementation of a fault current limiter (FCL) to locally limit the DG fault current, and thus restore the original relay coordination. The proposed restoration approach is carried out without altering the original relay settings or disconnecting DGs from PDSs during fault. Therefore, it is applicable to both the current practice of disconnecting DGs from PDSs, and the emergent trend of keeping DGs in PDSs during fault. The process of selecting FCL impedance type (inductive or resistive) and its minimum value is illustrated. Three scenarios are discussed: no DG, the implementation of DG with FCL and without FCL. Various simulations are carried out for both single- and multi-DG existence, and different DG and fault locations. The obtained results are reported and discussed.",2008,0,

30,31,Stress wave analysis of turbine engine faults,"Stress Wave Analysis (SWAN) provides real-time measurement of friction and mechanical shock in operating machinery. This high frequency acoustic sensing technology filters out background levels of vibration and audible noise, and provides a graphic representation of machine health. By measuring shock and friction events, the SWAN technique is able to detect wear and damage at the earliest stages and is able to track the progression of a defect throughout the failure process. This is possible because as the damage progresses, the energy content of friction and shock events increases. This `stress wave energy' is then measured and tracked against normal machine operating conditions.

31,32,High-level vulnerability over space and time to insidious soft errors,"The integrity of computational results is being increasingly threatened by soft errors, especially for computations that are large-scale or performed under harsh conditions. Existing methods for soft error estimation do not clearly characterize the vulnerability associated with a particular result. 1) We propose a metric which captures the intrinsic vulnerability over space and time (VST) to soft errors that corrupt computational results. The method of VST estimation bridges the gap between the inherently low-level faults and the high-level computational failures that they eventually cause. 2) We define a model of an insidious soft error and try to clear up confusion around the concept of silent data corruption. 3) We present experimental results from three vulnerability studies involving floating-point addition, CORDIC, and FFT computations. The results show that traditional vulnerability metrics can be confounded by seemingly reliable but inefficient implementations which actually incur high vulnerability per computation. The VST method characterizes vulnerability accurately, provides a figure-of-merit for comparing alternative implementations of an algorithm, and in some cases uncovers pronounced and unexpected fluctuations in vulnerability.",2008,0,

33,34,Using design patterns and constraints to automate the detection and correction of inter-class design defects,"Developing code free of defects is a major concern for the object oriented software community. The authors classify design defects as those within classes (intra-class), those among classes (inter-classes), and those of semantic nature (behavioral). Then, we introduce guidelines to automate the detection and correction of inter-class design defects. We assume that design patterns embody good architectural solutions and that a group of entities with organization similar, but not equal, to a design pattern represents an inter-class design defect. Thus, the transformation of such a group of entities, such that its organization complies exactly with a design pattern, corresponds to the correction of an inter-class design defect. We use a meta-model to describe design patterns and we exploit the descriptions to infer sets of detection and transformation rules. A constraint solver with explanations uses the descriptions and rules to recognize groups of entities with organizations similar to the described design patterns. A transformation engine modifies the source code to comply with the recognized distorted design patterns. We apply these guidelines on the Composite pattern using PTIDEJ, our prototype tool that integrates the complete guidelines",2001,0,

A newly introduced aspect of the method is that it corrects not only interframe but also intraframe movement, using currently used PET images (which are not corrected for intraframe movement) and motion tracking data. Although our method requires motion tracking data, it does not require very short time image acquisition nor list mode data acquisition. So, it is applicable to currently used PET images. In our method the following hypothesis is assumed. That is if no movement happens, there exists a linear model such that counts of each voxel per unit time follows the model. Model parameters may depend on the voxels. In a simple example, our method successfully corrected motion artifact and estimates the parameters accurately. It may give a simple and practical solution to the motion correction problems.",2003,0,

39,40,Fault-Tolerant Coverage Planning in Wireless Networks,"Typically wireless networks coverage is planned with static redundancy to compensate temporal variations in the environment. As a result, the service still is delivered but the network coverage could have entered a critical state, meaning that further changes in the environment may lead to service failure. Service failures have to be explicitly notified by the applications. Therefore, in this paper we propose a methodology for fault-tolerant coverage planning. The idea is detecting the critical state and removing it by on-line system reconfiguration, and restoration of the original static redundancy. Even in case of a failure the system automatically generates a new configuration to restore the service, leading to shorter repair times. We describe how this approach can be applied to wireless mesh networks, often used in industrial applications like manufacturing, automation and logistics. The evaluation results show that the underlying model used for error detection and system recovery is accurate enough to correctly identify the system state.",2008,0,

The characteristics of scaling and translation of WT can be used to identify stable and transient signals. Discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) are initially used to extract distinctive features of the voltage and current signals, and are transformed into a series of detailed and approximated wavelet components. The coefficients of variation of the wavelet components are then calculated. This information is introduced into the training artificial neural networks (ANN) to determine an HIF from the operations of the switches. The simulated results clearly reveal that the proposed method can accurately identify the HIF in the distribution feeder.",2004,0,
41,42,A hierarchical framework for fault propagation analysis in complex systems,"In complex systems, there are few critical failure modes. Prognostic models are focused at predicting the evolution of those critical faults, assuming that other subsystems in the same system are performing according to their design specifications.

This paper aims at analyzing this aspect, i.e. interaction between different fault modes in various subsystems, of the failure prognostic problem. The application domain focuses on an aero propulsion system of the turbofan type. Creep in the high-pressure turbine blade is one of the most critical failure modes of aircraft engines.

44,45,Comparing Web Services Performance and Recovery in the Presence of Faults,"Web-services are supported by a complex software infrastructure that must ensure high performance and availability to the client applications. Web services industry holds a well established platform for performance benchmarking (e.g., TPC-App and SPEC jAppServer2004 benchmarks). In addition, several studies have been published recently by main vendors focusing web services performance. However, as peak performance evaluation has been the main focus, the characterization of the impact of faults in such systems has been largely disregarded. This paper proposes an approach for the evaluation and comparison of performance and recovery time in web services infrastructures. This approach is based on fault injection and is illustrated through a concrete example of benchmarking three alternative software solutions for web services deployment.",2007,0,
45,46,Evidence-Based Analysis and Inferring Preconditions for Bug Detection,"An important part of software maintenance is fixing software errors and bugs. Static analysis based tools can tremendously help and ease software maintenance. In order to gain user acceptance, a static analysis tool for detecting bugs has to minimize the incidence of false alarms. A common cause of false alarms is the uncertainty over which inputs into a program are considered legal. In this paper we introduce evidence-based analysis to address this problem. Evidence-based analysis allows one to infer legal preconditions over inputs, without having users to explicitly specify those preconditions. We have found that the approach drastically improves the usability of such static analysis tools. In this paper we report our experience with the analysis in an industrial deployment.",2007,0,

47,48,Calculation of transverse voltages of communication lines induced by the fault current of power system,"A double-line model is presented to calculate the transverse voltage of communication lines induced by the fault current of power lines. By dividing the communication line into several fictitious segments, a chain composed by the coupling P1-type circuit with distributed source is formed. The enhanced node voltage analysis (ENVA) is also developed in order to evaluate such a kind of model. The ENVA cuts the number of nodes down greatly because of treating the active and coupling impedance branches as a whole. In addition, the transverse voltages in time domain can be obtained easily from those calculated in frequency domain by means of fast Fourier transform. The numerical examples prove the validity and efficiency of the method by comparison with analytical results.

48,49,General review of fault diagnostic in wind turbines,"Global wind electricity-generating capacity increased by 28.7 percent in 2008 to 120,798 Gigawatts. This represents a twelve-fold increase from a decade ago, when world wind-generating capacity stood at less than 5 GW [1]. With wind becoming a key part of the electrical mix in Denmark (20% with 3.1 GW), Spain (8% with 10 GW), and Germany (6% with 18.4 GW), wind turbine reliability is having a bigger effect on overall electrical grid system performance and reliability [1]. This shows the impact of faults and downtime on the reliability of wind turbine especially for offshore wind farms which although are some of the most environmentally friendly and efficient methods to generate electricity in the world. However, the maintenance costs are high because of their remote location. This can amount to as much as 25 to 30% of the total energy production [2]. The aim of this paper is to present an overview of fault detection in wind turbines, study and analyze the faults and their root-causes. The paper also explores different techniques used in early fault detection to form base information for future work to build a general fault diagnostic scheme for wind turbines.",2010,0,
49,50,Reconfigurable context-free grammar based data processing hardware with error recovery,"This paper presents an architecture for context-free grammar (CFG) based data processing hardware for re-configurable devices. Our system leverages on CFGs to tokenize and parse data streams into a sequence of words with corresponding semantics. Such a tokenizing and parsing engine is sufficient for processing grammatically correct input data. However, most pattern recognition applications must consider data sets that do not always conform to the predefined grammar. Therefore, we augment our system to detect and recover from grammatical errors while extracting useful information. Unlike the table look up method used in traditional CFG parsers, we map the structure of the grammar rules directly onto the field programmable gate array (FPGA). Since every part of the grammar is mapped onto independent logic, the resulting design is an efficient parallel data processing engine. To evaluate our design, we implement several XML parsers in an FPGA. Our XML parsers are able to process the full content of the packets up to 3.59 Gbps on Xilinx Virtex 4 devices",2006,0,

This solution assumes that some information is known about the system from its design information and data structure. An example application of this solution is presented for a Ford machining cell that has been experiencing a gantry waiting problem. In the course of this example application, five inconsistencies were found between relatively common academic assumptions made by this fault detection solution (as well as others) and the actual cell's set-up and data.

56,57,Robust Speech Recognition Using a Cepstral Minimum-Mean-Square-Error-Motivated Noise Suppressor,"We present an efficient and effective nonlinear feature-domain noise suppression algorithm, motivated by the minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) optimization criterion, for noise-robust speech recognition. Distinguishing from the log-MMSE spectral amplitude noise suppressor proposed by Ephraim and Malah (E&M), our new algorithm is aimed to minimize the error expressed explicitly for the Mel-frequency cepstra instead of discrete Fourier transform (DFT) spectra, and it operates on the Mel-frequency filter bank's output. As a consequence, the statistics used to estimate the suppression factor become vastly different from those used in the E&M log-MMSE suppressor. Our algorithm is significantly more efficient than the E&M's log-MMSE suppressor since the number of the channels in the Mel-frequency filter bank is much smaller (23 in our case) than the number of bins (256) in DFT. We have conducted extensive speech recognition experiments on the standard Aurora-3 task. The experimental results demonstrate a reduction of the recognition word error rate by 48% over the standard ICSLP02 baseline, 26% over the cepstral mean normalization baseline, and 13% over the popular E&M's log-MMSE noise suppressor. The experiments also show that our new algorithm performs slightly better than the ETSI advanced front end (AFE) on the well-matched and mid-mismatched settings, and has 8% and 10% fewer errors than our earlier SPLICE (stereo-based piecewise linear compensation for environments) system on these settings, respectively.",2008,0,

58,59,Fault-Tolerant BPEL Workflow Execution via Cloud-Aware Recovery Policies,"BPEL is the de facto standard for business process modeling in today's enterprises and is a promising candidate for the integration of business and scientific applications that run in Grid or Cloud environments. In these distributed infrastructures, the occurrence of faults is quite likely. Without sophisticated fault handling, workflows are frequently abandoned due to software or hardware failures, leading to a waste of CPU hours. The fault handling mechanisms provided by BPEL are well suited for handling faults of the business logic, but infrastructure-induced errors should be handled automatically to avoid over-complication of workflow design and keep concerns separated. This paper identifies classes of faults that can be resolved automatically by the infrastructure, and provides a policy-based approach to configure this automatic behavior without the need for adding explicit fault handling mechanisms to the BPEL process. The proposed approach provides automatic redundancy of services using a Cloud infrastructure to allow substitution of defective services. An implementation based on the ActiveBPEL engine and Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud is presented.",2009,0,

We believe that this information set could be provided by any WSN regardless of its specific implementation. This abstraction makes the fault isolator generically applicable in enterprise business systems. The neural fault isolator was evaluated in a trial with 36 nodes and has proved to be highly efficient in the isolation of failed components.",2008,0,

We first show that a test sequence under the transparent-scan approach can imitate the application of broadside tests for transition faults. Test compaction can proceed similar to stuck-at faults by omitting test vectors from the test sequence. A new approach for enhancing test compaction is also described, whereby additional broadside tests are embedded in the transparent-scan sequence without increasing its length or reducing its fault coverage",2006,0,

In this paper we suggest a new approach using non-linear warping based on optic flow to map both baseline and diffusion weighted echo planar images to the anatomically correct T2 weighted spin echo image. The method is readily implemented and does not require a pre-processing step of rigid alignment. A global histogram matching precedes the base line EP image correction. A Markov random field based classification algorithm was implemented to cluster T2 weighted images into four different tissue type classes. This information was then used to synthesize diffusion based image models used in the warping algorithm to correct the geometric distortions in the diffusion weighted EP images.",2004,0,

The value of the inductance and capacitance depends on the area and size of the defect. By varying the various dimensions of the defect, the desired resonance frequency can be achieved. In this paper the effect of dumbbell shaped DGS, to the size reduction of a microstrip patch antenna is investigated.

Therefore, a literature survey of reliability of wind turbines, electrical machines and power electronic converters is given. Five different ways of achieving fault tolerance identified in the literature are discussed together with their applicability for wind turbines: (1) converters with redundant semiconductors, (2) fault tolerant converter topologies, (3) fault tolerance by increasing the number of phases, (4) fault tolerance of switched reluctance machines, and (5) design for fault tolerance of PM machines and converters. Because converters fail more often than machines, it makes sense to use of fault tolerant converter topologies.

Such defects are bound to hinder the correct operation of future processor systems, unless new online techniques become available to detect and to tolerate them while preserving the integrity of software applications running on the system. This paper proposes a new, software-based, defect detection and diagnosis technique. We introduce a novel set of instructions, called access-control extension (ACE), that can access and control the microprocessor's internal state. Special firmware periodically suspends microprocessor execution and uses the ACE instructions to run directed tests on the hardware. When a hardware defect is present, these tests can diagnose and locate it, and then activate system repair through resource reconfiguration. The software nature of our framework makes it flexible: testing techniques can be modified/upgraded in the field to trade off performance with reliability without requiring any change to the hardware. We evaluated our technique on a commercial chip-multiprocessor based on Sun's Niagara and found that it can provide very high coverage, with 99.22% of all silicon defects detected. Moreover, our results show that the average performance overhead of software-based testing is only 5.5%.

78,79,Optimizing Joint Erasure- and Error-Correction Coding for Wireless Packet Transmissions,"To achieve reliable packet transmission over a wireless link without feedback, we propose a layered coding approach that uses error-correction coding within each packet and erasure-correction coding across the packets. This layered approach is also applicable to an end-to-end data transport over a network where a wireless link is the performance bottleneck. We investigate how to optimally combine the strengths of error- and erasure-correction coding to optimize the system performance with a given resource constraint, or to maximize the resource utilization efficiency subject to a prescribed performance. Our results determine the optimum tradeoff in splitting redundancy between error-correction coding and erasure-correction codes, which depends on the fading statistics and the average signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the wireless channel. For severe fading channels, such as Rayleigh fading channels, the tradeoff leans towards more redundancy on erasure-correction coding across packets, and less so on error-correction coding within each packet. For channels with better fading conditions, more redundancy can be spent on error-correction coding. The analysis has been extended to a limiting case with a large number of packets, and a scenario where only discrete rates are available via a finite number of transmission modes.",2008,0,

86,87,Fault Diagnosis of Bearings in Rotating Machinery Based on Vibration Power Signal Autocorrelation,"Since fault in a great number of bearings commences from a single point defect, research on this category of faults has shared a great deal in predictive diagnosis literature. Single point defects will cause certain characteristic fault frequencies to appear in machine vibration spectrum. In traditional methods, data extracted from frequency spectrum has been used to identify damaged bearing part. Because of impulsive nature of fault strikes, and complex modulations present in vibration signal, a simple spectrum analysis may result in erroneous conclusions. When a shaft rotates at constant speed, strikes due to a single point defect repeat at constant intervals. Each strike shows a high energy distribution around it. This paper considers the time intervals between successive impulses in auto-correlated vibration power signals. The most frequent interval between successive impulses determines the period of defective part. This period is related to fault frequency and therefore shows the defective part. A comparison of results extracted from the traditional and the proposed methods shows the efficiency improvement of the second method in respect of the first one",2006,0,
87,88,A Distributed Fault-Tolerant Algorithm for Event Detection Using Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks,"Distributed event detection using wireless sensor networks has received growing interest in recent years. In such applications, a large number of inexpensive and unreliable sensor nodes are distributed in a geographical region to make firm and accurate local decisions about the presence or absence of specific events based on their sensor readings. However, sensor readings can be unreliable, due to either noise in the sensor readings or hardware failures in the devices, and may cause nodes to make erroneous local decisions. We present a general fault-tolerant event detection scheme that allows nodes to detect erroneous local decisions based on the local decisions reported by their neighbors. This detection scheme does not assume homogeneity of sensor nodes and can handle cases where nodes have different accuracy levels. We prove analytically that the derived fault-tolerant estimator is optimal under the maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion. An equivalent weighted voting scheme is also derived. Further, we describe two new error models that take into account the neighbor distance and the geographical distributions of the two decision quorums. These models are particularly suitable for detection applications where the event under consideration is highly localized. Our fault-tolerant estimator is simulated using a network of 1024 nodes deployed randomly in a square region and assigned random probability of failures",2006,0,

Actuators in the aerospace and transportation industries are examples of this kind of operation. Diagnostics of faults in such applications is, however, challenging. A novel method using windowed Fourier ridges is proposed in this paper for the detection of rotor faults in BLDC motors operating under continuous non-stationarity. Experimental results are presented to validate the concept and depict the ability of the proposed algorithm to track and identify rotor faults. The proposed algorithm is simple and can be implemented in real-time without much computational burden.",2005,0,
89,90,Supervision and fault management of process-tasks and terminology,"The supervision of technical processes is aimed at showing the present state, indicating undesired or unpermitted states, and taking appropriate actions to avoid damage or accidents. The deviations from normal process behavior result from faults and errors, which can be attributed to many causes. They may result in some shorter or longer time periods with malfunctions or failures if no counteractions are taken. One reason for supervision is to avoid these malfunctions or failures. In the following article the basic tasks of supervision are shortly described.",2007,0,
90,91,An industrial case study of implementing and validating defect classification for process improvement and quality management,"Defect measurement plays a crucial role when assessing quality assurance processes such as inspections and testing. To systematically combine these processes in the context of an integrated quality assurance strategy, measurement must provide empirical evidence on how effective these processes are and which types of defects are detected by which quality assurance process. Typically, defect classification schemes, such as ODC or the Hewlett-Packard scheme, are used to measure defects for this purpose. However, we found it difficult to transfer existing schemes to an embedded software context, where specific document- and defect types have to be considered. This paper presents an approach to define, introduce, and validate a customized defect classification scheme that considers the specifics of an industrial environment. The core of the approach is to combine the software engineering know-how of measurement experts and the domain know-how of developers. In addition to the approach, we present the results and experiences of using the approach in an industrial setting. The results indicate that our approach results in a defect classification scheme that allows classifying defects with good reliability, that allows identifying process improvement actions, and that can serve as a baseline for evaluating the impact of process improvements",2005,0,
91,92,Evaluation of soft-bit error sequence generators at the output of the decoding process,"Soft decision decoding algorithms are widely used in modern wireless systems; convolutional and turbo codes are usually adopted as the inner scheme thanks to their capability to correct symbol errors at low SNR values. Such algorithms can achieve high coding gains using soft decoding, and modern digital hardware technology enables efficient and low cost practical implementations. We apply the experience gained in previous work, concerning the simulation of bit error processes (Costamagna, E. et al., Proc. IEEE, vol.90 p.842-59, 2002), to implement soft-bit generative models based on hidden Markov chains and chaotic attractors. Both the input and the output of the demodulation process of a GSM-GPRS and a 3GPP UMTS transceiver are observed, developing our earlier analysis (Costamagna et al., IEEE 58th VTC, 2003), and the quality of the soft-bit sequences generated for the input is evaluated comparing the sequences obtained at the output of the demodulator when simulated or target sequences are supplied at the input. Moreover, the deep significance of some statistical features exhibited by the sequences in order to describe their error burst behavior is briefly discussed.",2004,0,
92,93,Procedure call duplication: minimization of energy consumption with constrained error detection latency,"This paper presents a new software technique for detecting transient hardware errors. The objective is to guarantee data integrity in the presence of transient errors and to minimize energy consumption at the same time. Basically, we duplicate computations and compare their results to detect errors. There are three choices for duplicate computations: (1) duplicating every statement in the program and comparing their results, (2) re-executing procedures with duplicated procedure calls and comparing the results, (3) re-executing the whole program and comparing the final results. Our technique is the combination of (1) and (2): Given a program, our technique analyzes procedure call behavior of the program and determines which procedures should have duplicated statements (choice (1)) and which procedure calls should be duplicated (choice (2)) to minimize energy consumption while controlling error detection latency constraints. Then, our technique transforms the original program into the program that is able to detect errors with reduced energy consumption by re-executing the statements or procedures. In benchmark program simulation, we found that our technique saves over 25% of the required energy on average compared to previous techniques that do not take energy consumption into consideration",2001,0,
93,94,The complexity of adding failsafe fault-tolerance,"In this paper, we focus our attention on the problem of automating the addition of failsafe fault-tolerance where fault-tolerance is added to an existing (fault-intolerant) program. A failsafe fault-tolerant program satisfies its specification (including safety and liveness) in the absence of faults. And, in the presence of faults, it satisfies its safety specification. We present a somewhat unexpected result that, in general, the problem of adding failsafe fault-tolerance in distributed programs is NP-hard. Towards this end, we reduce the 3-SAT problem to the problem of adding failsafe fault-tolerance. We also identify a class of specifications, monotonic specifications and a class of programs, monotonic programs. Given a (positive) monotonic specification and a (negative) monotonic program, we show that failsafe fault-tolerance can be added in polynomial time. We note that the monotonicity restrictions are met for commonly encountered problems such as Byzantine agreement, distributed consensus, and atomic commitment. Finally, we argue that the restrictions on the specifications and programs are necessary to add failsafe fault-tolerance in polynomial time; we prove that if only one of these conditions is satisfied, the addition of failsafe fault-tolerance is still NP-hard.",2002,0,

The approaches are: leader-driven multicast (LDM), monitoring MAC layer unicast (re)transmissions by other receivers; application-level forward error correction (FEC) using block erasure codes; negative feedback from selected receivers in the form of extra parity requests (EPR). The performance of these three methods is evaluated using both experiments on a mobile computing testbed and simulation. The results indicate that, while LDM is helpful in improving the raw packet reception rate, the combination of FEC and EPR is most effective in improving the frame delivery rate",2002,0,

96,97,Finding Faults: Manual Testing vs. Random+ Testing vs. User Reports,"The usual way to compare testing strategies, whether theoretically or empirically, is to compare the number of faults they detect. To ascertain definitely that a testing strategy is better than another, this is a rather coarse criterion: shouldn't the nature of faults matter as well as their number? The empirical study reported here confirms this conjecture. An analysis of faults detected in Eiffel libraries through three different techniques-random tests, manual tests, and user incident reports-shows that each is good at uncovering significantly different kinds of faults. None of the techniques subsumes any of the others, but each brings distinct contributions.",2008,0,

It aims to enable parallel applications to avoid anticipated failures via preventive migration and, in the case of unforeseeable failures, to minimize their impact through selective checkpointing. An adaptation manager is designed to make runtime decisions in response to failure prediction. Extensive experiments, by means of stochastic modeling and case studies with real applications, indicate that FT-Pro outperforms periodic checkpointing, in terms of reducing application completion times and improving resource utilization, by up to 43 percent.",2008,0,

This paper presents a framework that exploits the excess number of thrusters to accommodate thruster faults during operation. First, a redundancy resolution scheme is presented that considers the presence of an excess number of thrusters along with any thruster faults and determines the reference thruster forces to produce the desired motion. This framework is then extended to incorporate a dynamic state feedback technique to generate reference thruster forces that are within the saturation limit of each thruster. Results from both computer simulations and experiments are provided to demonstrate the viability of the proposed scheme",2002,0,

This paper explains the concept of middleware by enumerating its functions and categorizes middleware according to adopted communication models. It also extracts five essential requirements of automotive middleware and proposes a middleware design for automotive systems based on the message-oriented middleware (MOM) structure. The proposed middleware effectively addresses the derived requirements and includes many essential features such as real-time guarantee, fault-tolerance, and a global time base",2006,0,

103,104,Non-differential protection of a generator's stator utilizing fault transients,"This paper presents a novel protection scheme for detecting faults on the stator of a generator unit which is directly connected to a distribution system. In the scheme, a multi-channel fault transient detection unit, using the outputs of the current transformers (CTs) at the output of the generator terminal, is employed to extract the fault-generated transient current signals. The detector unit is tuned to extract two bands of fault generated transient signals with different center frequencies. A spectral comparison technique is applied to firstly compute the spectral energies of the two band signals, and then the fault diagnosis determines whether it is an internal and external fault by comparing the ratio of the two signals with a predefined threshold. The scheme offers advantages of immunity to CT saturation, and is capable of detecting both low level and interturn faults. In addition, the protection scheme is also simple in application, and is cost-effective in that it only requires one set of CTs. Simulation studies show that the proposed technique can give correct responses for various fault conditions",2001,0,
104,105,Towards fault tolerance pervasive computing,"Pervasive computing exists in the user's environment, the technology is sustainable if it is invisible to the user and does not intrude the user's consciousness. This requires that functioning of the multitude of devices in the environment be oblivious to the user. Therefore, the system has to be resilient to various kinds of faults and should be able to function despite faults. In addition, pervasive computing provides a platform for context-aware computing that enables automatic configuration of a pervasive system based on the environment context.

105,106,Globally optimal uneven error-protected packetization of scalable code streams,"In this paper, we present a family of new algorithms for rate-fidelity optimal packetization of scalable source bit streams with uneven error protection. In the most general setting where no assumption is made on the probability function of packet loss or on the rate-fidelity function of the scalable code stream, one of our algorithms can find the globally optimal solution to the problem in O(N<sup>2</sup>L<sup>2</sup>) time, compared to a previously obtained O(N<sup>3</sup>L<sup>2</sup>) complexity, where N is the number of packets and L is the packet payload size. If the rate-fidelity function of the input is convex, the time complexity can be reduced to O(NL<sup>2</sup>) for a class of erasure channels, including channels for which the probability function of losing n packets is monotonically decreasing in n and independent erasure channels with packet erasure rate no larger than N/2(N + 1). Furthermore, our O(NL<sup>2</sup>) algorithm for the convex case can be modified to rind an approximation solution for the general case.

Whereby such applications meet the users demand and offer a performance improvement, the susceptibility to faults of any used computer node is raised. Often a single fault may cause a complete application failure. On the other hand, the redundancy in distributed systems can be utilized for fast fault detection and recovery. So, we followed an approach that is based an duplication of each application process to detect crashes and faulty functions of single computer nodes. We concentrate on two aspects of efficient fault-tolerance-fast fault detection and recovery without delaying the application progress significantly. The contribution of this work is first a new fault detecting protocol for duplicated processes. Secondly, we enhance a roll forward recovery scheme so that it is applicable to a set of cooperative processes in conformity to the protocol",2000,0,
108,109,Straight-Edge Extraction in Distorted Images Using Gradient Correction,"Many camera lenses, particularly low-cost or wide-angle lenses, can cause significant image distortion. This means that features extracted naively from such images will be incorrect. A traditional approach to dealing with this problem is to digitally rectify the image to correct the distortion, and then to apply computer vision processing to the corrected image. However, this is relatively expensive computationally, and can introduce additional interpolation errors. We propose instead to apply processing directly to the distorted image from the camera, modifying whatever algorithm is used to correct for the distortion during processing, without a separate rectification pass. In this paper we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using the particular classic problem of gradient-based extraction of straight edges. We propose a modification of the Burns line extractor that works on a distorted image by correcting the gradients on the fly using the chain rule, and correcting the pixel positions during the line-fitting stage. Experimental results on both real and synthetic images under varying distortion and noise show that our gradient-correction technique can obtain approximately a 50% reduction in computation time for straight-edge extraction, with a modest improvement in accuracy under most conditions.",2009,0,

In order to preserve both high precision and high recall, we devise a candidate-elimination algorithm which determines appropriate context size of spelling correction rules based on rule accuracy. Experimental results showed that the proposed system can extract 42,537 spelling correction rules and apply the rules to correct spelling errors on the test corpus and thus, the rate of precision is increased from 31.08% to 79.04% on the basis of message unit.",2007,0,

Currently, there are two OPC approaches - the model-based OPC (MB-OPC) and the inverse lithography technology (ILT). MB-OPC generates masks which is less complex compared with ILT. But ILT produces much better results than MB-OPC in terms of contour fidelity because ILT is a pixel based method. Observing that MB-OPC preserves the mask shape topologies which leads to a lower mask complexity, we combine the strengths of both methods - the topology invariant property and the pixel based mask representation. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that this topological invariant pixel based OPC (TIP-OPC) paradigm is proposed, which fills the critical hole of the OPC landscape and potentially has many new applications. Our technical novelty includes the lithography friendly mask topological invariant operations, the efficient fast Fourier transform based cost function sensitivity computation and the TIP-OPC algorithm.

126,127,Recent improvements on the specification of transient-fault tolerant VHDL descriptions: a case-study for area overhead analysis,"We present a new approach to design reliable complex circuits with respect to transient faults in memory elements. These circuits are intended to be used in harmful environments like radiation. During the design flow, this methodology is also used to perform an early-estimation of the obtained reliability level. Usually, this reliability estimation step is performed in the laboratory, by means of radiation facilities (particle accelerators). By doing so, the early-estimated reliability level is used to balance the design process into a trade-off between maximum area overhead due to the insertion of redundancy and the minimum reliability required for a given application. This approach is being automated through the development of a CAD tool (FT-PRO). Finally, we present also a case-study of a simple microprocessor used to analyze the FT-PRO performance in terms of the area overhead required to implement the fault-tolerant circuit.",2000,0,
127,128,Error calculation techniques and their application to the Antenna Measurement Facility Comparison within the European Antenna Centre of Excellence,"This paper gives an overview of the ongoing activities under the Antenna Measurement activity of the Antenna Centre of Excellence (ACE) network within the EU 6th framework research program. In particular, in this work an attempt is made to establish a common uncertainty estimation criteria in spherical near field and far field antenna measurement systems. The results from this activity are important instruments to verify the measurements accuracies for antenna measurement ranges as well as to investigate and evaluate possible improvements in measurement set-ups and procedures.

128,129,GNSS pseudorange error density tracking using Dirichlet Process Mixture,"In satellite navigation system, classical localization algorithms assume that the observation noise is white-Gaussian. This assumption is not correct when the signal is reflected on the surrounding obstacles. That leads to a decrease of accuracy and of continuity of service. To enhance the localization performances, a better observation noise density can be use in an adapted filtering process. This article aims to show how the Dirich-let Process Mixture can be employed to track the observation density on-line. This sequential estimation solution is adapted when the noise is non-stationary. The approach will be tested under a simulation scenario with multiple propagation conditions. Then, this density modeling will be used in Rao-Blackwellised Particle Filter.",2010,0,
129,130,On handling dependent evidence and multiple faults in knowledge fusion for engine health management,"Diagnostic architectures that fuse outputs from multiple algorithms are described as knowledge fusion or evidence aggregation. Knowledge fusion using a statistical framework such as Dempster-Shafer (D-S) has been used in the context of engine health management. Fundamental assumptions made by this approach include the notion of independent evidence and single fault. In most real world systems, these assumptions are rarely satisfied. Relaxing the single fault assumption in D-S based knowledge fusion involves working with a hyper-power set of the frame of discernment. Computational complexity limits the practical use of such extension. In this paper, we introduce the notion of mutually exclusive diagnostic subsets. In our approach, elements of the frame of discernment are subsets of faults that cannot be mistaken for each other, rather than failure modes. These subsets are derived using a systematic analysis of connectivity and causal relationship between various components within the system. Specifically, we employ a special form of reachability analysis to derive such subsets. The theory of D-S can be extended to handle dependent evidence for simple and separable belief functions. However, in the real world the conclusions of diagnostic algorithms might not take the form of simple or separable belief functions. In this paper, we present a formal definition of algorithm dependency based on three metrics: the underlying technique an algorithm is using, the sensors it is using, and the feature of the sensor that the algorithm is using. With this formal definition, we partition evidence into highly dependent, weakly dependent and independent evidence. We present examples from a Honeywell auxiliary power unit to illustrate our modified D-S method of evidence aggregation",2006,0,
130,131,Transmission Line Fault Location Using Two-Terminal Data Without Time Synchronization,"This letter presents a new transmission line fault location method that uses current and voltage sinusoidal phasors at both ends, without necessity of data synchronization. The main difference among the classical Johns method resides in the fact that the proposed method is based on magnitude of fault point voltage and does not demand exact phase angles of the acquired signals. Simulated and real case results are presented, showing that the proposed algorithm is robust, accurate, and provides adequate performance. Practical applications confirm that the synchronization is not really necessary, making the method faster and easier to apply than classical methods in many real situations",2007,0,

133,134,Incremental fault-tolerant design in an object-oriented setting,"With the increasing emphasis on dependability in complex, distributed systems, it is essential that system development can be done gradually and at different levels of detail. We propose an incremental treatment of faults as a refinement process on object-oriented system specifications. An intolerant system specification is a natural abstraction from which a fault-tolerant system can evolve. With each refinement step a fault and its treatment are introduced, so the fault-tolerance of the system increases during the design process. Different kinds of faults are identified and captured by separate refinement relations according to how the tolerant system relates to abstract properties of the intolerant one in terms of safety, and liveness. The specification language utilized is object-oriented and based upon first-order predicates on communication traces. Fault-tolerance refinement relations are formalized within this framework",2001,0,

136,137,Group communication protocols under errors,"Group communication protocols constitute a basic building block for highly dependable distributed applications. Designing and correctly implementing a group communication system (GCS) is a difficult task. While many theoretical algorithms have been formalized and proved for correctness, only few research projects have experimentally assessed the dependability of GCS implementations under complex error scenarios. This paper describes a thorough error-injection experimental campaign conducted on Ensemble, a popular GCS. By employing synthetic benchmark applications, we stress selected components of the GCS $the group membership service, the FIFO-ordered reliable multicast - under various error models, including errors in the memory (text and heap segments) and in the network messages. The data show that about 5-6% of the failures are due to an error escaping Ensemble's error-containment mechanism and manifesting as a fail silence violation. This constitutes an impediment to achieving high dependability, the natural objective of GCSs. Our results are derived for a particular system (Ensemble), and more investigation involving other GCSs is required to generalize the conclusions. Nevertheless, through an accurate analysis of the failure causes and the error propagation patterns, this paper offers insights into the design and the implementation of robust GCSs.",2003,0,
137,138,Extended fault modeling used in the space shuttle PRA,"A probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) has been completed for the space shuttle with NASA sponsorship and involvement. This current space shuttle PRA is an advancement over past PRAs conducted for the space shuttle in the technical approaches utilized and in the direct involvement of the NASA centers and prime contractors. One of the technical advancements is the extended fault modeling techniques used. A significant portion of the data collected by NASA for the space shuttle consists of faults, which are not yet failures but have the potential of becoming failures if not corrected. This fault data consists of leaks, cracks, material anomalies, and debonding faults. Detailed, quantitative fault models were developed for the space shuttle PRA which involved assessing the severity of the fault, detection effectiveness, recurrence control effectiveness, and mission-initiation potential. Each of these attributes was transformed into a quantitative weight to provide a systematic estimate of the probability of the fault becoming a failure in a mission. Using the methodology developed, mission failure probabilities were estimated from collected fault data. The methodology is an application of counter-factual theory and defect modeling which produces consistent estimates of failure rates from fault rates. Software was developed to analyze all the relevant fault data collected for given types of faults in given systems. The software allowed the PRA to be linked to NASA's fault databases. This also allows the PRA to be updated as new fault data is collected. This fault modeling and its implementation with FRAS was an important part of the space shuttle PRA.",2004,0,
138,139,DMTracker: finding bugs in large-scale parallel programs by detecting anomaly in data movements,"While software reliability in large-scale systems becomes increasingly important, debugging in large-scale parallel systems remains a daunting task. This paper proposes an innovative technique to find hard-to-detect software bugs that can cause severe problems such as data corruptions and deadlocks in parallel programs automatically via detecting their abnormal behaviors in data movements. Based on the observation that data movements in parallel programs typically follow certain patterns, our idea is to extract data movement (DM)-based invariants at program runtime and check the violations of these invariants. These violations indicate potential bugs such as data races and memory corruption bugs that manifest themselves in data movements. We have built a tool, called DMTracker, based on the above idea: automatically extract DM-based invariants and detect the violations of them. Our experiments with two real-world bug cases in MVAPICH/MVAPICH2, a popular MPI library, have shown that DMTracker can effectively detect them and report abnormal data movements to help programmers quickly diagnose the root causes of bugs. In addition, DMTracker incurs very low runtime overhead, from 0.9% to 6.0%, in our experiments with High Performance Linpack (HPL) and NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB), which indicates that DMTracker can be deployed in production runs.",2007,0,
139,140,Lightweight Fault-Tolerance for Peer-to-Peer Middleware,"We address the problem of providing transparent, lightweight, fault-tolerance mechanisms for generic peer-to-peer middleware systems. The main idea is to use the peer-to-peer overlay to provide for fault-tolerance rather than support it higher up in the middleware architecture, e.g. in the form of services. To evaluate our approach we have implemented a fault-tolerant middleware prototype that uses a hierarchical peer-to-peer overlay in which the leaf peers connect to sensors that provide data streams. Clients connect to the root of the overlay and request streams that are routed upwards through intermediate peers in the overlay up to the client. We report encouraging preliminary results for latency, jitter and resource consumption for both the non-faulty and faulty cases.",2010,0,
140,141,Automated Support for Propagating Bug Fixes,"We present empirical results indicating that when programmers fix bugs, they often fail to propagate the fixes to all of the locations in a code base where they are applicable, thereby leaving instances of the bugs in the code. We propose a practical approach to help programmers to propagate many bug fixes completely. This entails first extracting a programming rule from a bug fix, in the form of a graph minor of an enhanced procedure dependence graph. Our approach assists the programmer in specifying rules by automatically matching simple rule templates; the programmer may also edit rules or compose them from scratch. A graph matching algorithm for detecting rule violations is then used to locate the places in the code base where the bug fix is applicable. Our approach does not require that rules occur repeatedly in the code base. We present empirical results indicating that the approach nevertheless exhibits good precision.",2008,0,

We use the results of a calibrated Ray tracing software in a sample office environment. First we divide the whole floor plan into LOS and Obstructed LOS (OLOS), and then we model the distance error in each environment considering the variation of bandwidth of the system. We show that the behavior of the distance error in LOS environment can be modeled as Gaussian, while behavior of the OLOS is a mixture of Gaussian and exponential distribution. We also related the statistics of the distributions to the bandwidth of the system.",2003,0,

SSFCLs can limit the magnitude of a fault current seen by a system using different methods, such as inserting a large impedance in the current path or controlling the voltage applied to the fault. However, these two methods can introduce a few problems when SSFCLs are used in a system along with other protection equipment such as protective relays and sensors. An experiment was designed and implemented to evaluate the behavior of the protective relays in a mimic distribution system with a SSFCL. This paper introduces the details of the experiment and the result shows that the distorted current and voltage waveforms resulting from the action of the SSFCL disturb the protective equipment.",2010,0,
143,144,Considering Fault Correction Lag in Software Reliability Modeling,"The fault correction process is very important in software testing, and it has been considered into some software reliability growth models (SRGMs). In these models, the time-delay functions are often used to describe the dependency of the fault detection and correction processes. In this paper, a more direct variable ""correction lag"", which is defined as the difference between the detected and corrected fault numbers, is addressed to characterize the dependency of the two processes. We investigate the correction lag and find that it appears Bell-shaped. Therefore, we adopt the Gamma function to describe the correction lag. Based on this function, a new SRGM which includes the fault correction process is proposed. And the experimental results show that the new model gives better fit and prediction than other models.",2008,0,
144,145,Effects of Defects on the Thermal and Optical Performance of High-Brightness Light-Emitting Diodes,"Defects in terms of voids, cracks, and delaminations are often generated in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) devices and modules. During various manufacturing processes, accelerated testing, inappropriate handling, and field applications, defects are most frequently induced in the early stage of process development. One loading is due to the nonuniform loads caused by temperature, moisture, and their gradients. In this research, defects in various cases are modeled by a nonlinear finite-element method (FEM) to investigate the existence of interfaces, interfacial open and contacts in terms of thermal contact resistance, stress force nonlinearity, and optical discontinuity, in order to analyze their effects on the LED's thermal and optical performance. The simulation results show that voids and delaminations in the die attachment would enhance the thermal resistance greatly and decrease the LED's light extraction efficiency, depending on the defects' sizes and locations generated in packaging.",2009,0,

146,147,Evaluation of risk in canal irrigation systems due to non-maintenance using fuzzy fault tree approach,"The safety and performance of many existing irrigation systems could be improved by doing the preventive maintenance activities. Modeling canal irrigation systems in terms of condition and performance that can be directly correlated with particular canal system maintenance activities. There are two categories of scheduled maintenance activity in irrigation maintenance systems: maintenance may be targeted towards restoring deliveries (""restorative maintenance""), or towards reducing the risk of failures (""preventative maintenance""). This paper covers the latter kind of maintenance scheduling by 'risk analysis'. The purpose of this risk analysis is to forecast the impact of preventative maintenance on deliveries from the main channel systems. After gaining the experience from the preliminary risk analysis through questionnaire based survey and failure history of past record, a 'fuzzy fault tree (FFT)' method is developed for the rapid risk assessment and it is necessitated for the irrigation system manager/engineer. 'Risk analysis' of irrigation systems from the point of view of maintenance is studied and applied to the Tirunelveli Channel Systems located in India.

147,148,Waveform matching approach for fault diagnosis of a high-voltage transmission line employing harmony search algorithm,"An accurate and effective technology for fault diagnosis of a high-voltage transmission line plays an important role in supporting rapid system restoration. The fault diagnosis of a high-voltage transmission line involves three major tasks, namely fault-type identification, fault location and fault time estimation. The diagnosis problem is formulated as an optimisation problem in this work: the variables involved in the fault diagnosis problem, such as the fault location, and the unknown variables such as ground resistance, are taken into account as optimisation variables; the sum of the discrepancy of the approximation components of the actual and expected waveforms is taken as the optimisation objective. Then, according to the characteristics of the formulated optimisation problem, the harmony search, an effective heuristic optimisation algorithm developed in recent years, is employed to solve this problem.

154,155,An empirical validation of the relationship between the magnitude of relative error and project size,"Cost estimates are important deliverables of a software project. Consequently, a number of cost prediction models have been proposed and evaluated. The common evaluation criteria have been MMRE, MdMRE and PRED(k). MRE is the basic metric in these evaluation criteria. The implicit rationale of using a relative error measure like MRE, rather than an absolute one, is presumably to have a measure that is independent of project size. We investigate if this implicit claim holds true for several data sets: Albrecht, Kemerer, Finnish, DMR and Accenture-ERP. The results suggest that MRE is not independent of project size. Rather, MRE is larger for small projects than for large projects. A practical consequence is that a project manager predicting a small project may falsely believe in a too low MRE. Vice versa when predicting a large project. For researchers, it is important to know that MMRE is not an appropriate measure of the expected MRE of small and large projects. We recommend therefore that the data set be partitioned into two or more subsamples and that MMRE is reported per subsample. In the long term, we should consider using other evaluation criteria.",2002,0,

All CED techniques introduce some form of redundancy. Redundant systems we subject to common-mode failures (CMFs). While most of the studies of CED techniques focus on area overhead, few analyze the CMF vulnerability of these techniques. In this paper, we present simulation results to quantitatively compare various CED schemes based on their area overhead and the protection (data integrity) they provide against multiple failures and CMFs. Our results indicate that, for the simulated combinational logic circuits, although diverse duplex systems (with two different implementations of the same logic function) sometimes have marginally higher area overhead, they provide significant protection against multiple failures and CMFs compared to other CED techniques like parity prediction",2000,0,
157,158,Optimal scheduling of imprecise computation tasks in the presence of multiple faults,"With the advance of applications such as multimedia, image/speech processing and real-time AI, real-time computing models allowing to express the timeliness versus precision trade-off are becoming increasingly popular. In the imprecise computation model, a task is divided into a mandatory part and an optional part. The mandatory part should be completed by the deadline even under worst-case scenario; however, the optional part refines the output of a mandatory part within the limits of the available computing capacity. A non-decreasing reward function is associated with the execution of each optional part. Since the mandatory parts have hard deadlines, provisions should be taken against faults which may occur during execution. An FT-Optimal framework allows the computation of a schedule that simultaneously maximizes the total reward and tolerates transient faults of mandatory parts. We extend the framework to a set of tasks with multiple deadlines, multiple recovery blocks and precedence constraints among them. To this aim, we first obtain the exact characterization of imprecise computation schedules which can tolerate up to k faults, without missing any deadlines of mandatory parts. Then, we show how to generate FT-Optimal schedules in an efficient way. Our solution works for both linear and general concave reward functions",2000,0,

The major advantage of using a FIB is that one can control the size, shape, and orientation of artificial defects precisely, allowing realistic surface defects, e.g., half-penny-shaped, 100 mum long, <1 mum wide, and 50 mum deep. We have demonstrated that multiple artificial defects with varying inclination angles relative to the specimen's crystallographic orientation can be machined in a few hours.

159,160,A parallel and fault tolerant file system based on NFS servers,"One important piece of system software for clusters is the parallel file system. All current parallel file systems and parallel I/O libraries for clusters do not use standard servers, thus it is very difficult to use these systems in heterogeneous environments. However why use proprietary or special-purpose servers on the server end of a parallel file system when you have most of the necessary functionality in NFS servers already? This paper describes the fault tolerance implemented in Expand (Expandable Parallel File System), a parallel file system based on NFS servers. Expand allows the transparent use of multiple NFS servers as a single file system, providing a single name space. The different NFS servers are combined to create a distributed partition where files are stripped. Expand requires no changes to the NFS server and uses RPC operations to provide parallel access to the same file. Expand is also independent of the clients, because all operations are implemented using RPC and NFS protocol. Using this system, we can join heterogeneous servers (Linux, Solaris, Windows 2000, etc.) to provide a parallel and distributed partition. Fault tolerance is achieved using RAID techniques applied to parallel files. The paper describes the design of Expand and the evaluation of a prototype of Expand, using the MPI-IO interface.

As a consequence, dynamic and automatic fixing of integration problems in systems that include OTS components can be extremely beneficial to increase their reliability and mitigate these risks. In this paper, we present a technique for enhancing component-based systems with capabilities to self-heal common integration faults by using a predetermined set of healing strategies. The set of faults that can be healed has been determined from the analysis of the most frequent integration bugs experienced by users according to data in bug repositories available on Internet. An implementation based on AOP techniques shows the viability of this technique to heal faults in real case studies.",2008,0,
167,168,Recursive Evaluation of Fault Tolerance Mechanisms for SLA Management,"Service level agreements (SLAs) have been introduced into the grid in order to build a basis for its commercial uptake. The challenge for Grid providers in agreeing and operating SLA-bound jobs is to ensure their fulfillment even in the case of failures. Hence, fault-tolerance mechanisms are an essential means of the provider's SLA management. The high utilization of commercial operated clusters leads to scenarios in which typically a job migration effects other jobs scheduled. The effects result from the unavailability of enough free resources which would be needed to catch all resource outages. Consequently before initiating a migration, its effects for other jobs have to be compared and the initiation of fault- tolerance (FT-) mechanisms have to be evaluated recursively. This paper presents a measurement for the benefit of initiating a FT-mechanism, the recursive evaluation, and termination condition. Performing such an impact evaluation of an initiated chain of FT-mechanisms is often more profitable than performing a single FT-mechanism and accordingly this is important for the Grid commercialization.",2008,0,
168,169,Corrective control strategies in case of infeasible operating situations,"A new method that deals with power systems infeasible operating situations is proposed in this paper. In case these situations occur, appropriate corrective actions must be efficiently obtained and quickly implemented. In order to accomplish this, it is necessary (a) to quantify the systems unsolvability degree (UD), and (b) to determine a corrective control strategy to pull the system back into the feasible operation region. UD is determined through the smallest distance between the infeasible (unstable) operating point and the feasibility boundary in parameter (load) space. In this paper the control strategies can be obtained by two methods, namely the proportionality method (PM) and the nonlinear programming based method (NLPM). Capacitor banks, tap changing transformers and load shedding are the usual controls available. Simulations have been carried out, for small to large systems, under contingency and heavy load situations, in order to show the efficiency of the proposed method. It can be a very useful tool in operation planning studies, particularly in voltage stability analysis.",2001,0,

170,171,Using Search Methods for Selecting and Combining Software Sensors to Improve Fault Detection in Autonomic Systems,"Fault-detection approaches in autonomic systems typically rely on runtime software sensors to compute metrics for CPU utilization, memory usage, network throughput, and so on. One detection approach uses data collected by the runtime sensors to construct a convex-hull geometric object whose interior represents the normal execution of the monitored application. The approach detects faults by classifying the current application state as being either inside or outside of the convex hull. However, due to the computational complexity of creating a convex hull in multi-dimensional space, the convex-hull approach is limited to a few metrics. Therefore, not all sensors can be used to detect faults and so some must be dropped or combined with others. This paper compares the effectiveness of genetic-programming, genetic-algorithm, and random-search approaches in solving the problem of selecting sensors and combining them into metrics. These techniques are used to find 8 metrics that are derived from a set of 21 available sensors. The metrics are used to detect faults during the execution of a Java-based HTTP web server. The results of the search techniques are compared to two hand-crafted solutions specified by experts.",2010,0,

For a large set of feature extraction techniques, it is found that contrasting to intuition, no improvement but even significant result degradation of classification accuracy can be observed. For techniques relying on geometrical properties of the image material (shape), moderate improvements of classification accuracy can be achieved. Reasons for this somewhat unexpected results are discussed and ways how to exploit potential distortion correction benefits are sketched.",2010,0,
172,173,A comparison of phase space reconstruction and spectral coherence approaches for diagnostics of bar and end-ring connector breakage faults in polyphase induction motors using current waveforms,"Two signal (waveform) analysis approaches are investigated in this paper for motor drive fault identification-one linear and the other nonlinear. Twenty-one different motor-drive operating conditions including healthy, 1 through 10 broken bars, and 1 through 10 broken end-ring connectors are investigated. Highly accurate numerical simulations of current waveforms for the various operating conditions are generated using the time stepping coupled finite element-state space method for a 208-V, 60-Hz, 2-pole, 1.2-hp, squirrel cage 3-phase induction motor. The linear signal analysis method is based on spectral coherence, whereas the nonlinear signal analysis method is based on stochastic models of reconstructed phase spaces.

173,174,Ontology-based fault diagnosis for industrial control applications,"Traditional fault detection systems in industrial control applications are just able to report occurring faults. Fault diagnosis systems are more desirable for plant operators, as such systems are capable to reduce the number of occurring alarms by elimination of consecutive alarms and prioritization of critical alarms. The disadvantage of those systems is that they have to be implemented anew for every control application, as the system dependencies vary from application to application. Ontology-based fault diagnosis systems do not have this disadvantage. Only the ontology has to be created for the new system, which greatly reduces time and effort for new systems, as old ontologies can be reused for the new system.",2010,0,
174,175,Ground control for the geometric correction of PAN imagery from Indian remote sensing (IRS) satellites,"Efficacy of a hand-held global positioning system (GPS) receiver in stand-alone mode of GPS measurements was investigated by taking measurements on different dates. These measurements were compared to those observed by DGPS and total station for the validation of hand-held GPS receiver accuracy. Ground control point (GCP) coordinates were derived from 1:25,000 and 1:50,000 scale topographic maps, and by using two different types of GPS receivers- a stand-alone hand-held and dual frequency DGPS receivers. GCPs derived from each source were used independently for the GCP-based geometric correction of IRS PAN sensor images by using affine mapping function. GCPs derived from maps yielded root mean squares (RMS) error from 15 to 35 m respectively. However, GCPs derived by DGPS or stand-alone mode hand-held GPS receiver gave RMS error in the range of 3 to 6 meter, which is very close to spatial resolution of PAN sensor imagery (5.8 m). The mean values of GCP coordinates observed with the help of hand-held GPS receiver in stand-alone mode might prove a cost effective solution for the determination of GCP coordinates in the geometric correction of current high-resolution imagery from IRS satellites.",2003,0,
175,176,Synchronization Probabilities using Conventional and MVDR Beam Forming with DOA Errors,"In this paper, code synchronization probabilities of the direct sequence spread spectrum (DS/SS) system are investigated when the receiver utilizes an adaptive antenna array. Performance studies of three beam forming algorithms in the presence of direction-of-arrival (DOA) errors are presented. The investigated algorithms are the conventional, the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR), and the MVDR+ADL where the MVDR algorithm is enhanced against DOA error via the adaptive diagonal loading (ADL). The paper includes a large number of analytical and simulation results where the effects of DOA errors are investigated. It can be concluded that the MVDR beam former is more sensitive to DOA errors than the conventional beam former, especially, at large DOA errors and high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) values. However, this sensitivity can be reduced notably by using the ADL.",2007,0,
176,177,Fault Tree Reuse Across Multiple Reasoning Paradigms,"The development of a diagnostic model can be a very time-consuming and manually intensive process. One must first analyze the Test Program Set (TPS) to determine the fault tree and then integrate with that any additional knowledge that can be obtained from external data sources (such as test results, maintenance actions from the various maintenance levels, run-time failure information, etc.). The diagnostic models defined in the IEEE Std. 1232-2002 (AI-ESTATE) each define a different method that can be used for a diagnostic reasoner. It has been determined that each of these models utilize the information found in the basic TPS fault tree. As the fault tree represents hard won engineering knowledge that is expensive to reproduce, it is desirable to share the fault tree representations across multiple reasoner models. This paper will layout how each model type in the AI-ESTATE standard utilizes the fault tree to perform diagnostics and how, through the use of the XML representation of the AI-ESTATE fault tree model, that basic fault tree can be shared between reasoner models. It would also be desirable to find a way to gain that fault tree knowledge without having to manually reproduce it. As such, this paper will also describe how that information can at least be semi-automatically extracted from TPS design artifacts.",2006,0,

178,179,"Mutual coupling in microstrip antenna array: evaluation, reduction, correction or compensation","Mutual coupling between the antenna elements in a microstrip antenna array is a potential source of performance degradation, particularly in a highly congested environment. The degradation includes impedance mismatching, increased side-lobe level, deviation of the radiation pattern from the desired one, and decrease of gain due to the excitation of a surface wave. To deal with these problems, the first thing is to evaluate the mutual coupling and to select the element with low mutual coupling. Then, it is still desired to reduce the mutual coupling further by taking some measures. Finally, in certain critical cases, it is necessary to involve the mutual coupling effects accurately through numerical analysis, such as ultra low side lobe arrays and adaptive ing arrays. All these issues are discussed and some numerical examples are given. Due to limited space, the paper focuses mainly on the work done in our laboratory.",2005,0,

We detail our algorithm for geometric and shading correction and demonstrate its usefulness on real-world and synthetic data.",2006,0,
180,181,A novel co-evolutionary approach to automatic software bug fixing,"Many tasks in software engineering are very expensive, and that has led the investigation to how to automate them. In particular, software testing can take up to half of the resources of the development of new software. Although there has been a lot of work on automating the testing phase, fixing a bug after its presence has been discovered is still a duty of the programmers. In this paper we propose an evolutionary approach to automate the task of fixing bugs. This novel evolutionary approach is based on co-evolution, in which programs and test cases co-evolve, influencing each other with the aim of fixing the bugs of the programs. This competitive co-evolution is similar to what happens in nature for predators and prey. The user needs only to provide a buggy program and a formal specification of it. No other information is required. Hence, the approach may work for any implementable software. We show some preliminary experiments in which bugs in an implementation of a sorting algorithm are automatically fixed.",2008,0,
181,182,An NN-based atmospheric correction algorithm for Landsat/TM thermal infrared data,"Land surface temperature (LST) is a key variable for studies of global or regional land surface processes, energy and water cycle, and thus, has important applications in various areas. Atmospheric correction is a major issue in LST retrieval using remote sensing data because the presence of the atmosphere always influences the radiation from the ground to the space sensor. Atmospheric correction of thermal infrared (TIR) data for land surface temperature retrieval is to estimate the three atmospheric parameters: transmittance, path radiance and the downward radiance. Typically the atmospheric parameters are obtained using atmospheric profiles combined with a radiative transfer model (RTM). But this approach is time-consuming and expensive, which is impractical for high-speed (near-realtime) operational atmospheric correction. An artificial neural network (NN) based atmospheric correction model for Landsat/TM thermal infrared data is proposed. The multi-layer feed-forward neural network (MFNN) is selected, in which the atmospheric profiles (temperature, humidity and pressure), elevation and scan angle are the input variables, and the atmospheric parameters are the output variables. The MFNN is combined with the radiative transfer simulation, using MODTRAN 4.0 and the latest global assimilated data. Finally, the transmittance and path radiance derived by the MFNN-based algorithm is compared with MODTRAN4.0 results. The RMSE for both parameters are 0.0031 and 0.035 Wm<sup>-2</sup>sr<sup>-1</sup>m<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The results indicate that the proposed approach can be a practical method for Landsat/TM thermal data in both accuracy and efficiency.",2010,0,

183,184,Three-Dimensional Pareto-Optimal Design of Inductive Superconducting Fault Current Limiters,"The inductive-type superconducting fault current limiters (LSFCLs) mainly consist of a primary copper coil, a secondary complete or partial superconductor cylinder, and a closed or open magnetic iron core. Satisfactory performance of such device significantly depends on optimal selection of its employed materials and construction dimensions, as well as its electrical, thermal, and magnetic parameters. Therefore, it is very important to identify a comprehensive model describing the LSFCL behavior in a power system prior to its fabrication. When a fault occurs, the dynamic model should essentially characterize the overall phenomena to compare the simulation results by varying LSFCL parameters to maximize the merits of a fault current limiter while minimizing its drawbacks during the normal state. The principle object of this paper is to achieve a feasible and full penetrative approach in 3-D alignments, i.e., a Pareto-optimal design of LSFCLs by means of multicriteria decision-making techniques after defining the LSFCL model in a power system CAD/electromagnetic transients including dc environment.",2010,0,

185,186,Coverage gain estimation for multi-burst forward error correction in DVB-H networks,"An approach for increasing the reception robustness of mobile broadcast streaming services has been developed for mobile broadcast systems based on time-slicing, such as DVB-H, employing multi-burst FEC at link or application layer. Multiple bursts will be encoded jointly in order to overcome burst errors caused by signal level variations. The approach shows high potential which can be characterized by a link margin gain due to reduced CNR requirements to cope with fast fading and shadowing. Nevertheless, the achieved gain depends on several system parameters (encoding period and coding rate), the physical environment (correlation of shadowing and multi-path fading) and on the mobility of the users (velocity and trajectory). The paper deals with the coverage estimation and network gain due to multi-burst FEC for vehicular users in a realistic urban scenario. Since the user behavior has to be considered the gain cannot be directly included into the link budget. Thus, a methodology has been developed in order to estimate the coverage of multi-burst FEC services based on dynamic system-level simulations. Results are shown by means of simulations in realistic scenarios and field measurements in urban environments.",2009,0,

First of all an extension of a previous XML formalization of basic binary faults, like memory and CPU registers corruption, is done in order to support TLM2.0transaction's parameters corruptions. Next a novel Dynamic Binary Instrumentation (DBI) technique for C++ binaries is used to insert fault injection wrappers in SystemC transaction path.

189,190,Modular fault recovery in timed discrete-event systems: application to a manufacturing cell,"This paper extends the previous results of the authors on fault recovery to timed discrete-event systems (TDES), and discusses the application of the proposed methodology to a manufacturing cell. It is assumed that the plant can be modelled as a TDES, the faults are permanent, and that a diagnosis system is available that detects and isolates faults with a bounded delay (expressed in clock ticks). Thus, the combination of the plant and the diagnosis system, as the system to be controlled, has three modes: normal, transient and recovery. Initially, the plant is in the normal mode. Once a fault occurs, the system enters the transient mode. After the fault is detected and isolated by the diagnosis system, the system enters the recovery mode. This framework does not depend on the diagnosis technique used, as long as lower and upper bounds for diagnosis delay are available. A modular switching supervisory scheme is proposed to satisfy the system specifications. The design consists of a normal-transient supervisor, and multiple recovery supervisors each for recovery from a particular failure mode. The issue of the nonblocking property of the system under supervision, and also supervisor admissibility (controllability), in particular coerciveness, are studied. The proposed approach is applied to a manufacturing cell consisting of two machines and two conveyors. A modular switching supervisor is designed to ensure the specifications in the normal mode are met. In cases of failure, the supervisor sends appropriate recovery commands so that the cell can complete its production cycle",2005,0,

192,193,Operational Fault Detection in cellular wireless base-stations,"The goal of this work is to improve availability of operational base-stations in a wireless mobile network through non-intrusive fault detection methods. Since revenue is generated only when actual customer calls are processed, we develop a scheme to minimize revenue loss by monitoring real-time mobile user call processing activity. The mobile user call load profile experienced by a base-station displays a highly non-stationary temporal behavior with time-of-day, day-of-the-week and time-of-year variations. In addition, the geographic location also impacts the traffic profile, making each base-station have its own unique traffic patterns. A hierarchical base-station fault monitoring and detection scheme has been implemented in an IS-95 CDMA Cellular network that can detect faults at - base station level, sector level, carrier level, and channel level. A statistical hypothesis test framework, based on a combination of parametric, semi-parametric and non-parametric test statistics are defined for determining faults. The fault or alarm thresholds are determined by learning expected deviations during a training phase. Additionally, fault thresholds have to adapt to spatial and temporal mobile traffic patterns that slowly changes with seasonal traffic drifts over time and increasing penetration of mobile user density. Feedback mechanisms are provided for threshold adaptation and self-management, which includes automatic recovery actions and software reconfiguration. We call this method, Operational Fault Detection (OFD).

194,195,A study of student strategies for the corrective maintenance of concurrent software,"Graduates of computer science degree programs are increasingly being asked to maintain large, multi-threaded software systems; however, the maintenance of such systems is typically not well-covered by software engineering texts or curricula. We conducted a think-aloud study with 15 students in a graduate-level computer science class to discover the strategies that students apply, and to what effect, in performing corrective maintenance on concurrent software. We collected think-aloud and action protocols, and annotated the protocols for a number of behavioral attributes and maintenance strategies. We divided the protocols into groups based on the success of the participant in both diagnosing and correcting the failure. We evaluated these groups for statistically significant differences in these attributes and strategies. In this paper, we report a number of interesting observations that came from this study. All participants performed diagnostic executions of the program to aid program comprehension; however, the participants that used this as their predominant strategy for diagnosing the fault were all unsuccessful. Among the participants that successfully diagnosed the fault and displayed high confidence in their diagnosis, we found two commonalities. They all recognized that the fault involved the violation of a concurrent-programming idiom. And, they all constructed detailed behavioral models (similar to UML sequence diagrams) of execution scenarios. We present detailed analyses to explain the attributes that correlated with success or lack of success. Based on these analyses, we make recommendations for improving software engineering curriculums by better training students how to apply these strategies effectively.",2008,0,

196,197,Effective Static Analysis to Find Concurrency Bugs in Java,"Multithreading and concurrency are core features of the Java language. However, writing a correct concurrent program is notoriously difficult and error prone. Therefore, developing effective techniques to find concurrency bugs is very important. Existing static analysis techniques for finding concurrency bugs either sacrifice precision for performance, leading to many false positives, or require sophisticated analysis that incur significant overhead. In this paper, we present a precise and efficient static concurrency bugs detector building upon the Eclipse JDT and the open source WALA toolkit (which provides advanced static analysis capabilities). Our detector uses different implementation strategies to consider different types of concurrency bugs. We either utilize JDT to syntactically examine source code, or leverage WALA to perform interprocedural data flow analysis. We describe a variety of novel heuristics and enhancements to existing analysis techniques which make our detector more practical, in terms of accuracy and performance. We also present an effective approach to create inter-procedural data flow analysis using WALA for complex analysis. Finally we justify our claims by presenting the results of applying our detector to a range of real-world applications and comparing our detector with other tools.",2010,0,
197,198,A case study of evaluation technique for soft error tolerance on SRAM-based FPGAs,"SRAM-based field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are vulnerable to a single event upset (SEU), which is induced by radiation effect. Therefore, the dependable design techniques become important, and the accurate dependability analysis method is required to demonstrate their robustness. Most of present analysis techniques are performed by using full reconfiguration to emulate the soft error. However, it takes long time to analyze the dependability because it requires many times of reconfiguration to complete the soft error injection. In the present paper, we construct the soft error estimation system to analyze the reliability and to reduce the estimation time. Moreover, we apply Monte Carlo simulation to our approach, and identify trade-off between accuracy of error rate and estimation time. As a result of our experimentation for 8-bit full-adder and multiplier, we can show the dependability of the implemented system. Also, the constructed system can reduce the estimation time. According to the result, when performing about 50% circuit Monte Carlo simulation, the error rate is within 20%.",2010,0,
198,199,Effects of finite weight resolution and calibration errors on the performance of adaptive array antennas,"Adaptive antennas are now used to increase the spectral efficiency in mobile telecommunication systems. A model of the received carrier-to-interference plus noise ratio (CINR) in the adaptive antenna beamformer output is derived, assuming that the weighting units are implemented in hardware, The finite resolution of weights and calibration is shown to reduce the CINR. When hardware weights are used, the phase or amplitude step size in the weights can be so large that it affects the maximum achievable CINR. It is shown how these errors makes the interfering signals leak through the beamformer and we show how the output CINR is dependent on power of the input signals. The derived model is extended to include the limited dynamic range of the receivers, by using a simulation model. The theoretical and simulated results are compared with measurements on an adaptive array antenna testbed receiver, designed for the GSM-1800 system. The theoretical model was used to find the performance limiting part in the testbed as the 1 dB resolution in the weight magnitude. Furthermore, the derived models are used in illustrative examples and can be used for system designers to balance the phase and magnitude resolution and the calibration requirements of future adaptive array antennas",2001,0,

Scatter correction (2 iterations, OSEM) typically requires 15-45 sec per bed. Very good agreement between the estimated scatter and measured emission data for several typical clinical scans is reported for CPS Pico-3D and HiRez LSO PET/CT systems.

201,202,Time and frequency domain analyses based expert system for impulse fault diagnosis in transformers,"The presence of insulation failure in the transformer winding is detected using the voltage and current oscillograms recorded during the impulse test. Fault diagnosis in transformers has several parameters such as the severity of fault, the kind of fault and the location of the fault. Detection of major faults involving a large section of the coils have never been a big issue and several visual and computational methods have already been proposed by several researchers. The present paper describes an expert system based on re-confirmative method for the diagnosis of minor insulation failures involving small number of turns in transformers during impulse tests. The proposed expert system imitates the performance of an experienced testing personnel. To identify and locate a fault, an inference engine is developed to perform deductive reasoning based on the rules in the knowledge base and different statistical techniques. The expert system includes both the time-domain and frequency-domain analyses for fault diagnosis. The basic aim of the expert system is to provide a non-expert with the necessary information and interaction in order to make fault diagnosis in a friendly windowed environment. The rules for fault diagnosis have been so designed that these are valid for the range of power transformers used in practice up to a voltage level of 33 kV. The fault diagnosis algorithm has been tested using experimental results obtained for a 3 MVA transformer and simulation results obtained for 5 and 7 MVA transformers",2002,0,
