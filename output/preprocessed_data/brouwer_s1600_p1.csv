0,Extreme response style in recurrent and chronically depressed patients: change with antidepressant administration and stability during continuation treatment.,"Peterson, Timothy J.; Feldman, Greg; Harley, Rebecca; Fresco, David M.; Graves, Lesley; Holmes, Avram; Bogdan, Ryan; Papakostas, George I.; Bohn, Laurie; Lury, R. Alana; Fava, Maurizio; Segal, Zindel V.","The authors examined extreme response style in recurrently and chronically depressed patients, assessing its role in therapeutic outcome. During the acute phase, outpatients with major depressive disorder (N = 384) were treated with fluoxetine for 8 weeks. Remitted patients (n = 132) entered a continuation phase during which their fluoxetine dose increased and they were randomly assigned to treatment with or without cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Results showed a predictive relationship between extreme response style and clinical outcome. Patients in the medication-only group showed a significant increase in the frequency of extreme responses, whereas patients receiving CBT showed no significant change. These results are consistent with recent findings suggesting that metacognitive factors may be as important as changes in thought content when treating depression.",2007.0,10.1037/0022-006X.75.1.145,2MY5I4VV,1,cognitive,1
1,Psychometric deviance in offspring at risk for schizophrenia: I. Initial delineation of a distinct subgroup.,"Moldin, S. O.; Gottesman, I. I.; Erlenmeyer-Kimling, L.; Cornblatt, B. A.","Psychometric signs from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), which measure substantive disturbances in thinking, social relatedness, volition, and affective expressivity, were evaluated as possible indicators of transmissible liability specific to schizophrenia. Children of three criterion groups in the New York High-Risk Project--offspring at high risk (HR) for schizophrenia, psychiatric comparison (PC) offspring at risk for affective disorders, and normal comparison (NC) offspring not at augmented risk for psychiatric morbidity--were tested before the expression of schizophrenic psychopathology, when the subjects ranged in age from 13 to 26 years. The rate of psychometric deviance in the HR group (23 \ \% \ ) was significantly higher than that in either the PC (7 \ \% \ ) or NC (2 \ \% \ ) groups, and profile analyses showed that the HR subgroup could be delineated by qualitative distinctions in personality functioning. Our results support the utility of MMPI indicators in etiologic investigations of schizophrenia.",1990.0,,R9LTASER,0,personality,2
2,Practice of therapy acquired regulatory skills and depressive relapse/recurrence prophylaxis following cognitive therapy or mindfulness based cognitive therapy,"Segal, Zindel V.; Anderson, Adam K.; Gulamani, Tahira; Dinh Williams, Le-Ahn; Desormeau, Philip; Ferguson, Amanda; Walsh, Kathleen; Farb, Norman A. S.","Background: To investigate whether usage of treatment-acquired regulatory skills is associated with prevention of depressive relapse/recurrence. Method: Remitted depressed outpatients entered a 24-month clinical follow up after either 8 weekly group sessions of cognitive therapy (CT; N = 84) or mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT; N = 82). The primary outcome was symptom return meeting the criteria for major depression on Module A of the SCID. Results: Factor analysis identified three latent factors (53% of the variance): decentering (DC), distress tolerance (DT), and residual symptoms (RS), which were equivalent across CT and MBCT. Latent change score modeling of factor slopes over the follow up revealed positive slopes for DC (beta = .177), and for DT (beta = .259), but not for RS (beta = -.017), indicating posttreatment growth in DC and DT, but no change in RS. Cox regression indicated that DC slope was a significant predictor of relapse/recurrence prophylaxis, Hazard Ratio (HR) = .232 90% Confidence Interval (CI) [.067, .806], controlling for past depressive episodes, treatment group, and medication. The practice of therapy-acquired regulatory skills had no direct effect on relapse/recurrence (beta = .028) but predicted relapse/recurrence through an indirect path (beta = -.125), such that greater practice of regulatory skills following treatment promoted increases in DC (beta = .462), which, in turn, predicted a reduced risk of relapse/recurrence over 24 months (beta = -.270). Conclusions: Preventing major depressive disorder relapse/recurrence may depend upon developing DC in addition to managing residual symptoms. Following the acquisition of therapy skills during maintenance psychotherapies, DC is strengthened by continued skill utilization beyond treatment termination. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement What is the public health significance of this article?-People receiving maintenance psychotherapies for depression are expected to utilize emotion regulation skills past the point of active treatment but receive little guidance regarding which skills are most effective. Our data suggest that resilience to episode return depends upon the development of metacognitive skills for the regulation of distressing thoughts and emotions.

3,How does cognitive therapy prevent relapse in residual depression? Evidence from a controlled trial.,"Teasdale, John D.; Scott, Jan; Moore, Richard G.; Hayhurst, Hazel; Pope, Marie; http://orcid.org/Scott","This study examined the cognitive mediation of relapse prevention by cognitive therapy (CT) in a trial of 158 patients with residual depression. Scores based on agreement with item content of 5 questionnaires of depression-related cognition provided no evidence for cognitive mediation. A measure of the form of response to those questionnaires, the number of times patients used extreme response categories ( totally agree and totally disagree ), showed significant and substantial prediction of relapse, differential response to CT, and conformity to mediational criteria. CT reduced relapse through reductions in absolutist, dichotomous thinking style. CT may prevent relapse by training patients to change the way that they process depression-related material rather than by changing belief in depressive thought content.

4,The cognitive patterns of depressed patients.,"Jiao, Li; Xu, Junmian","Studied the cognitive patterns of depressed patients based on the cognitive theory of A. T. Beck et al (1979). Ss were 51 patients (aged 20-55 yrs) with depressive disorder (DD), 41 patients (aged 20-55 yrs) with nondepressed schizophrenia (NDS), and 96 normal controls (aged 20-55 yrs). The Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire, Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used. Cognitive patterns of DD Ss were compared to those of NDS Ss and controls based on Ss' test scores using descriptive statistics. The relationships among automatic thoughts, dysfunctional attitudes, DD, and the remission of DD were analyzed using correlation coefficients, factor analyses, and multiple regression analyses to identify principal factors contributing to dysfunctional attitudes.

5,Relationship between mother-child mediated learning experience (MLE) strategies and mothers' attachment style and mental health.,"Isman, Esther B.; Tzuriel, David","The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between mother-child mediated learning experience (MLE) strategies and mothers' attachment and mental health. Fifty two Israeli mother-child dyads were videotaped at home in two interaction conditions: free play and structured. The interactions were analyzed using the Observation of Mediated Interaction (OMI). Mothers rated themselves on the Attachment Scale and the Mental Health Inventory. MLE strategies were found to be positively predicted by secure attachment and negatively by anxious attachment. In addition, MLE strategies were positively predicted by feelings of wellbeing. Gender differences are discussed. The findings support previous findings about affect-cognition relationships, and indicate the importance of perceiving the mediator from a holistic point of view. Mediation is perceived not only as a determining factor of affective processes, but also as being determined by them.

6,Trajectories of Depressive Symptoms Over 2 Years Postpartum Among Overweight or Obese Women,"Lee, C. T.; Stroo, M.; Fuemmeler, B.; Malhotra, R.; stbye, T.","Background: Although depressive symptoms are common postpartum, few studies have followed women beyond 12months postpartum to investigate changes in the number and severity of these symptoms over time, especially in overweight and obese women. Using two complementary analytical methods, this study aims to identify trajectories of depressive symptoms over 2 years postpartum among overweight or obese mothers, and assess the demographic, socioeconomic, and health covariates for these trajectories. Methods: Using longitudinal data from two behavioral intervention studies (Kids and Adults Now!-Defeat Obesity [KAN-DO] and Active Mothers Postpartum (AMP); n=844), we used latent growth modeling to identify the overall trajectory of depressive symptoms and how it was related to key covariates. Next, we used latent class growth analysis to assess the heterogeneity in the depressive symptom trajectories over time, and thereby, identify subgroups of women with distinct trajectories. Findings: The overall trajectory of depressive symptoms over 2 years postpartum was relatively stable in our sample. However, the presence of three distinct latent class trajectories (stable-low [82.5 \% ], decreasing symptoms [7.3 \% ], and increasing symptoms [10.2 \% ]), identified based on trajectory shape and mean depressive symptom score, supported heterogeneity in depressive symptom trajectories over time. Lower maternal education was related to a higher symptom score, and poorer subjective health status at baseline predicted inclusion in the increasing symptoms trajectory. Conclusions: In some overweight or obese mothers, postpartum depressive symptoms do not resolve quickly. Practitioners should be aware of this phenomenon and continue to screen for depression for longer periods of time postpartum.",2014.0,,9D7SHZZB,0,behavior,7

Attention is then called to a common, variably adaptive, and socially approved means of obviating or coping with envious feelings, involving a partial identification and culminating in the conscious experience of being proud of. A conjecture is made regarding narcissistic pathology, which is most likely to interfere with this mechanism.

8,Black/white differences in psychological adjustment to spousal loss among older adults,"Carr, D. S.","This study examines differences between Blacks and Whites in the effect of widowhood on depressive symptoms and anxiety; in grief symptoms six months after spousal loss; and the extent to which these differences are explained by marital quality, social support from children and friends, and religiosity. Analyses are based on the Changing Lives of Older Couples, a prospective study of 1,532 married individuals aged 65 and older. Widowhood is associated with elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms, yet these effects do not differ by race. Among widowed persons only, Blacks and Whites report similar levels of overall grief, yearning, intrusive thoughts, shock, depressive symptoms, and anxiety, whereas Blacks report significantly lower levels of anger and despair. The racial gap in anger is explained by Blacks' higher levels of religious participation and social support from children, whereas the difference in despair reflects Blacks' higher levels of preloss marital conflict.",2004.0,10.1177/0164027504268495,YHTRXNCC,0,cognitive_additional,9
9,Prognostic significance of depression occurrence in infantile autism.,"Scifo, R.; Calandra, C.; Parrinello, M. A.; Marchetti, B.","Autistic children undergoing therapeutic programs, which adopt in our service (USL 3 CT) different theoretical approaches, sometimes show a marked reduction in motor activities, a lowering of tone of voice, physical expression of sadness. We observe that animation is absent in the scene they may draw and colours are no longer used in their drawings. Sleep disturbance may appear or reappearance of enuresis. Many authors consider these symptoms as signs of depression. These changes, even though they create new problems in therapeutic management, are, in our opinion, a very important index of the unblocking of autistic withdrawal and beginning of development of those emotional, relational and cognitive components which seem to be frozen in autistic children and inhibit the birth of the mind, according to the U. Frith Theory. We report in this paper the psychoanalytic, cognitive, systemic, biological viewpoint on the occurrence of depression in infantile autism. We submit three cases of patients being treated in our service with the cognitive-behavioural oriented educational program and pharmacological therapy and discuss the multidimensional approach. The temporary occurrence of depression symptoms may be an index of a change within the resisting autistic balance, which may have a biological basis, but indicates the disorganization of the autistic child's mind in view of further development.",1996.0,,4RFNY7DF,0,cognitive,10
10,30 YEARS OF THE MINERALOCORTICOID RECEPTOR: Mineralocorticoid receptor mutations,"Zennaro, M. C.; Fernandes-Rosa, F.","Aldosterone and the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) are key elements for maintaining fluid and electrolyte homeostasis as well as regulation of blood pressure. Loss-of-function mutations of the MR are responsible for renal pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1), a rare disease of mineralocorticoid resistance presenting in the newborn with weight loss, failure to thrive, vomiting and dehydration, associated with hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis, despite extremely elevated levels of plasma renin and aldosterone. In contrast, a MR gain-of-function mutation has been associated with a familial form of inherited mineralocorticoid hypertension exacerbated by pregnancy. In addition to rare variants, frequent functional single nucleotide polymorphisms of the MR are associated with salt sensitivity, blood pressure, stress response and depression in the general population. This review will summarize our knowledge on MR mutations in PHA1, reporting our experience on the genetic diagnosis in a large number of patients performed in the last 10 years at a national reference center for the disease. We will also discuss the influence of rare MR variants on blood pressure and salt sensitivity as well as on stress and cognitive functions in the general population.",2017.0,10.1530/joe-17-0089,LLVR57SP,0,additional,11
11,Augmenting serotonin reuptake inhibitors in obsessive-compulsive disorder: What moderates improvement?,"Wheaton, Michael G.; Rosenfield, David; Foa, Edna B.; Simpson, H. Blair; http://orcid.org/Wheaton","Objective: Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) often only partially respond to serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs). In such cases, American Psychiatric Association practice guidelines suggest augmenting SRIs with cognitive-behavioral therapy consisting of exposure and ritual prevention (EX/RP) or antipsychotic medication (i.e., risperidone). We examined moderators and predictors of these 2 augmentation strategies. Method: Data came from a randomized controlled trial that compared adding EX/RP or risperidone to SRIs in adults with OCD. Patients entered the study on a stable SRI dosage and were randomized to EX/RP (N = 40), risperidone (N = 40), or placebo (N = 20). Data were analyzed using multilevel modeling. Results: Pretreatment OCD severity, age, and depression were significant moderators. Although OCD severity was unrelated to EX/RP response, individuals with more severe OCD had poorer outcomes and slower improvement with risperidone. Increasing age predicted better response to risperidone, but not EX/RP. Increased depression predicted poorer response to placebo, but not EX/RP or risperidone. Poorer functioning predicted worse outcome across all 3 conditions. Together, these moderators and predictor accounted for 33 \% of the variance in outcomes, above and beyond the 30.8 \% accounted for by treatment condition. Conclusions: SRI augmentation with EX/RP was more effective than risperidone across all of the demographic and clinical variables tested. EX/RP's superiority over risperidone increased with baseline OCD severity and with younger age. These data indicate that EX/RP should be the recommended SRI augmentation strategy, even for severe OCD. What determines the degree of EX/RP response in individual patients deserves further study.

12,Using personal scalings on life event inventories to predict dysphoria,"Zimmerman, M.","The predictive ability of subjective weights of life events was examined. The focus of this study was the event 'doing very poorly on an important exam'. Two days before taking their midterm in an introductory psychology class, 164 students rated 120 life events as to the degree of negative impact on their life they believed the event did have (if it previously occurred) or would have (if it had not occurred). The subjects also filled out the Depressive Adjective Checklist (DACL) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). One week later, on the day the grades were returned to the students, the second testing session was held. One hundred thirty-two subjects returned to again complete the two measures of depression. Thirty-three of the students were identified as having experienced the event. The results of a hierarchical multiple regression showed that the subjective rating of negative impact was a significant predictor of post-exam DACL scores but not post-exam BDI scores. Previous experience with the event was not associated with either post-exam depression measure. It is suggested that the perception of life events is an important variable in life event research and that subjective weights can be utilized as markers of individuals who are vulnerable to the effects of stress.",1983.0,,A2KPI7X8,0,diathesis,13

Less is known, however, about the specific processes that foster the maintenance of such prolonged and intense emotions-particularly positive-over time in this disorder. We investigated group-related differences in the ability to maintain positive and negative emotion representations over time using a previously validated emotion working memory task (Mikels et al., 2005, 2008) among individuals with bipolar I disorder (BD; n = 29) compared with both major depressive disorder (MDD; n = 29) and healthy control (n = 30) groups. Results revealed that the BD group exhibited a selective deficit in maintaining negative-but not positive-emotions compared to both the MDD and the control groups. The MDD and control groups did not differ significantly. These findings suggest that the heightened magnitude and duration of positive emotion observed in BD may, in part, be accounted for by difficulties maintaining negative emotions.",2013.0,10.1037/a0029381,DCH82NKP,0,cognitive_additional,16
16,"Patient coordination style during the first session of therapy: Relationship with early alliance, patient's characteristics and outcomes","Beretta, V. and","In the past two decades, psychotherapy researchers and clinicians postulated that the therapeutic alliance is a key component in psychotherapy. Meta-analyses confirm this assumption and conclude that alliance is a powerful predictor of therapeutic outcome for various forms of treatments, problems and patients. In the literature, various measures of alliance are mentioned but not much is known about the behavioural correlates and the nature of this process. The coordination construct is a way to analyse the micro-process involved in the interactional process. Defined by Westerman and Foote (Psychotherapy 1995;32:222-32) as how well a patient relates his or her contributions in the exchange to the therapist's contributions and to the patient's own contributions at other points in time , the patient's coordination style (PCS) focuses on the complex interaction process and defensive pattern involved in the problematic patient's behaviour. Our hypothesis is that the coordination construct involves conversational collaboration needed to create a strong alliance. The aim of the study is to investigate this hypothesis by analysing the interaction between patient and therapist. Furthermore, the influence of patient's characteristic on patient's coordination style at the beginning of the therapy is explored. Moreover, in line with findings in the alliance literature, we expect to find a relationship between coordination style and therapeutic outcome. The data consisted in 60 self-referred outpatients with anxiety and depressive disorders (with/without cluser C personality disorders) that completed the Brief Psychodynamic Intervention in the Adult Psychiatry outpatient unit of the University of Lausanne (Switzerland). Coordination style was assessed at the first session by means of the coordination scales and alliance was measured by the Helping Alliance Questionnaire (Haq-I), patient's version administrated after each session of treatment. Patient's characteristics are measured in terms of global symptomatic distress (SCL-90), social adjustment (SAS), interpersonal problems (IIP) and overall level of defensive functioning (DMRS). Outcome of treatment consists of reduction in symptomatic distress (SCL-90, HAMA, HDRS) and positive evolution of social adjustment. As predicted, patient coordination style was closely related to the therapeutic alliance as assessed by the patient. Furthermore, patient's coordination style in the first session was a good predictor of the development of the alliance during early sessions of Brief Psychodynamic Intervention. Results showed that coordination was largely influenced by patient's characteristics. The global symptomatic distress, the level of social malad-justment and specific interpersonal problems (hostility and domineering) were correlated to a non-coordinated style. However, coordination was not related to outcome in Brief Psychodynamic Intervention. With regard to these results, the specific roles of therapist and patient in developing early alliance are discussed.",2004.0,,YMSFXLGY,0,personality,17
17,Predictors of psychological outcomes in nonheterosexual individuals.,"Sanders, Emily K.; Chalk, Holly McCartney","Gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, and queer (GLBPQ) individuals have higher rates of negative psychological outcomes, but the reasons for these trends are unclear. Gay-related stress including internalized homophobia, perceived stigma, and overt discrimination may contribute to these heightened rates, but gay identity may buffer these consequences. GLBPQ individuals (N = 1,169) completed online surveys of gay-related stress, protective factors, and outcomes including depression, anxiety, stress, nonsuicidal self-injury, and suicidality. Hierarchical regressions were used to examine predictive relationships between gay-related stress, gay identity, and negative outcomes. Among gay/lesbian participants, overt discrimination predicted all outcomes; gay identity predicted Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) depression, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) depression, and DASS stress; and internalized homophobia predicted Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) stress (p \textless .001). Among bisexual and pansexual participants, perceived stigma predicted CES-D depression, DASS depression, and Pereceived Stress Scale (PSS) stress, and overt discrimination predicted CES-D depression (p \textless .001). Gay identity predicted reduced negative outcomes among gay and lesbian people, but did not affect bisexual or pansexual people. Gay identity did not interact significantly with overt discrimination, perceived stigma, or internalized homophobia, challenging the hypothesis that it would buffer their effects. These results indicated that the factors may function differently in different populations, highlighting the need for further research on the topic.

The use of opioid antagonists may protect against the development of memory deficits after ECT. The current study aimed at assessing the effect of Naltrexone in diminishing memory impairments. Methods: This randomized, double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled clinical trial took place at Imam Hossein hospital of Tehran/Iran. Patients diagnosed withMDD, were assigned to either Naltrexone or placebo and received 6 sessions of ECT within 2 weeks.Wechsler Memory Scale was performed the day before the first session of ECT, as well as 2 weeks, 1 and 3 months after finishing the 6th session. The Hamilton depression rating scale was performed 2 times to examine the possible interference caused by depression or to relapse as a confounding variable. Results: Patients receiving Naltrexone and placebo showed no significant difference in WMS scores. However, after further assessment, changes of WMS scores in every round were compared; the results showed that after 2 weeks from baseline, the amount of the reduction of total WMS scores from baseline was significantly lower in the Naltrexone group (P = 0.04). Conclusions: This study suggests that Naltrexone as compared to placebo has no advantageous effect on attenuating memory deficits in the long term. It is a smaller degree of memory decline that makes Naltrexone superior to placebo. Copyright © 2017, Iranian Red Crescent Medical Journal.",2017.0,10.5812/ircmj.59814,UT4PIB5B,0,additional,19

In humans, CR may improve health span, yet concerns remain about potential negative effects of CR. OBJECTIVE To test the effect of CR on mood, quality of life (QOL), sleep, and sexual function in healthy nonobese adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A multisite randomized clinical trial (Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy Phase 2 [CALERIE 2]) was conducted at 3 academic research institutions. Adult men and women (N = 220) with body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 22.0 to 28.0 were randomized to 2 years of 25 \% CR or an ad libitum (AL) control group in a 2:1 ratio favoring CR. Data were collected at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months and examined using intent-to-treat analysis. The study was conducted from January 22, 2007, to March 6, 2012. Data analysis was performed from July 18, 2012, to October 27, 2015. INTERVENTIONS Two years of 25 \% CR or AL. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Self-report questionnaireswere administered to measure mood (Beck Depression Inventory-II [BDI-II], score range 0-63, higher scores indicatingworse mood, and Profile of Mood States [POMS], with a total mood disturbance score range of -32 to 200 and higher scores indicating higher levels of the constructs measured), QOL (Rand 36-Item Short Form, score range 0-100, higher scores reflecting better QOL, and Perceived Stress Scale, score range 0-40, higher scores indicating higher levels of stress), sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI], total score range 0-21, higher scores reflectingworse sleep quality), and sexual function (Derogatis Interview for Sexual Function-Self-report, total score range 24-188, higher scores indicating better sexual functioning). RESULTS In all, 218 participants (152women [69.7 \% ]; mean [SD] age, 37.9 (7.2) years; mean [SD] BMI, 25.1 [1.6])were included in the analyses. The CR and AL groups lost a mean (SE) of 7.6 (0.3) kg and 0.4 (0.5) kg, respectively, at month 24 (P \textless .001). Compared with the AL group, the CR group had significantly improved mood (BDI-II: between-group difference [BGD], -0.76; 95 \% CI, -1.41 to -0.11; effect size [ES], -0.35), reduced tension (POMS: BGD, -0.79; 95 \% CI, -1.38 to -0.19; ES, -0.39), and improved general health (BGD, 6.45; 95 \% CI, 3.93 to 8.98; ES, 0.75) and sexual drive and relationship (BGD, 1.06; 95 \% CI, 0.11 to 2.01; ES, 0.35) at month 24 as well as improved sleep duration at month 12 (BGD, -0.26; 95 \% CI, -0.49 to -0.02; ES, -0.32) (all P \textless .05).

METHODS: We investigated the application of QUS in the evaluation of bone status in a group of 64 adolescents ( \textgreater 12 years) and young adults ( \textless 40 years) with CF in a comparison with a dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the whole body and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) of the radius at 4 \% and 66 \% sites. RESULTS: Mean (SD) Z-scores of speed of sound (SOS), whole body bone mineral content (BMC), radial trabecular bone mineral density (BMD), and radial cortical BMD were respectively -0.31 (0.78), -0.09 (1.28), 0.10 (1.16) and -0.62 (2.88). The pQCT determined bone geometry values (cortical bone area and cortical thickness) were more depressed than the BMD data.

21,A polymorphism in the dopamine beta-hydroxylase gene is associated with paranoid ideation in patients with major depression.,"Wood, Jordan G.; Joyce, Peter R.; Miller, Allison L.; Mulder, Roger T.; Kennedy, Martin A.","BACKGROUND: Increased dopaminergic activity may play a primary role in psychotic depression. Dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DbetaH) catalyses the key step in biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter noradrenaline from dopamine, and low DbetaH activity is a possible risk factor for developing psychotic depression. An exon 2 polymorphism (DBH*444 g/a) of the DbetaH gene (DBH) is significantly associated with both serum and cerebrospinal fluid levels of DbetaH. METHODS: We determined the genotype of the DBH*444g/a polymorphism in a cohort of 164 patients with major depression and examined the association of this polymorphism with paranoid ideation, interpersonal sensitivity, and psychoticism on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist. RESULTS: Patients who possessed the A allele were significantly more likely to have higher scores for interpersonal sensitivity and paranoia than patients without the A allele (p =.004 and p =.048, respectively), suggesting that this allele may predispose patients to paranoia in major depression. In addition, we found an association between prolactin levels in men and DBH*444 g/a genotype such that homozygous G individuals displayed significantly higher levels than homozygous A or heterozygote individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Depressed patients with the GG genotype of DbetaH have lower scores for interpersonal sensitivity and paranoid ideation. The GG genotype may be protective against the development of psychosis in the presence of a major depressive episode.",2002.0,,EVTJ2QHA,0,personality,22
22,Experimental manipulation of affective judgments about physical activity: a systematic review and meta-analysis of adults,"Rhodes, R. E.; Gray, S. M.; Husband, C.","The purpose of this meta-analysis was to examine the current effectiveness of physical activity (PA) interventions to change affective judgements (AJ) and subsequent behaviour and explore potential moderators. Eligible studies were published in a peer-reviewed English journal and included an experimental design in the PA domain with a measure of AJ as the dependent variable, among adults (>17 years). Literature searches concluded in July 2017 using 11 common databases, with additional hand searching conducted in February 2018. The search yielded 32 independent studies. Random-effects meta-analysis showed positive changes in AJ favouring intervention over control groups, g = 0.43 (95% CI = 0.26-0.60). These changes predicted (beta = 0.64) positive changes in PA, g = 0.38 (95% CI = 0.16-0.60), among a sub-sample (k = 14) of studies that also provided behavioural data. Moderator analyses showed the effects were inflated by potential publication bias, participant gender, baseline PA and focus of the intervention. AJ may show change from intervention but larger sample studies are required to obtain a more reliable effect size estimate. Further, few studies have employed behaviour change techniques that would align with the theoretical reasons for changes in AJ, so our evidence for practical intervention content is limited.",2018.0,10.1080/17437199.2018.1530067,HZHZAAVR,0,additional,23
23,Micromegas: Altered Body-Environment Scaling in Literary Fiction.,"Dieguez, Sebastian","Architectonic embodiment postulates a bidirectional link between bodily awareness and the architectural environment. The standard size and features of the human body, for instance, are thought to influence the structure of interiors and buildings, as well as their perception and appreciation. Whereas architectural practice and theory, the visual arts and more recently the cognitive sciences have explored this relationship of humans with their crafted environments, many fictional literary works have long experimented with alterations of body-environment scaling. This so-called Gulliver theme - popular in the science-fiction genre but also in children's literature and philosophical satire - reveals, as a recurrent thought-experiment, our preoccupation with proportions and our fascination for the infinitely small and large. Here I provide an overview of the altered scaling theme in literature, including classics such as Voltaire's Micromegas, Swift's Gulliver's Travels, Caroll's Alice, and Matheson's The Shrinking man, closely examining issues relevant to architectonic embodiment such as: bodily, perceptual, cognitive, affective, and social changes related to alterations in body size relative to people, objects and architectural environments. I next provide a taxonomy of the Gulliver theme and highlight its main psychological features, and then proceed to review relevant work from cognitive science. Although fictional alterations of body-environment scaling far outreach current possibilities in experimental research, I argue that the peripetiae and morals outlined in the literary realm, as products of the human imagination, provide a unique window into the folk-psychology of body and space.",2016.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00556,IFBCTQW4,0,cognitive,24
24,Methamphetamine: Putting the Brakes on Speed.,"Gettig, Jacob P.; Grady, Sarah E.; Nowosadzka, Izabella","In only recent history, illicit use of methamphetamine, once isolated to urban areas on the West Coast, has spread into rural areas of the Midwest and southern United States. Although past and current methamphetamine legislation has increased penalties for methamphetamine manufacturers and tightened restrictions on sales of known precursors, the problem still persists. In fact, a 2004 survey indicates that an alarming 6.2 \% of high school seniors have tried methamphetamine. A number of biological, genetic, and environmental factors influence children's and adolescents' paths to substance abuse. Nurses should recognize the symptoms of methamphetamine abuse, which include agitation; aggressive behavior; rapid mood swings; hypertension; tachycardia; and eventually lesion-marked skin, clinical depression, and paranoid psychosis. Treatment for methamphetamine addiction includes behavioral therapy. Research on pharmacologic therapy is lacking. Educating youth on methamphetamine prevention appears to be the best approach to curb the spreading use of this addictive and deadly drug.

25,Psychological processes underlying the development of a chronic pain problem: A prospective study of the relationship between profiles of psychological variables in the fear-avoidance model and disability,"Boersma, K.; Linton, S. J.","OBJECTIVES: Understanding the psychological processes that underlie the development of a chronic pain problem is important to improve prevention and treatment. The aim of this study was to test whether distinct profiles of variables within the fear-avoidance model could be identified and could be related to disability in a meaningful way. METHODS: In 81 persons with a musculoskeletal pain problem, cluster analysis was used to identify subgroups with similar patterns on fear and avoidance beliefs, catastrophizing, and depression. The clusters were examined cross-sectionally and prospectively on function, pain, health care usage, and sick leave. RESULTS: Five distinct profiles were found: pain-related fear, pain-related fear + depressed mood, medium pain-related fear, depressed mood, and low risk. These subgroups were clearly related to outcome. In contrast to the clusters medium pain-related fear and low risk, the majority of those classified in the clusters pain-related fear, pain-related fear + depressed mood, and depressed mood reported long-term sick leave during follow-up. The subjects in the clusters with high scores on the depression measure reported the highest percentage of health care usage during follow-up (70 \% in the pain-related fear + depressed mood group and 42 \% in the depressed mood group reported \textgreater 10 health care visits). CONCLUSIONS: Distinct profiles of psychological functioning could be extracted and meaningfully related to future disability. These profiles give support to the fear-avoidance model and underscore the need to address the psychological aspects of the pain experience early on.

26,Cognitive-emotional reactivation during deep transcranial magnetic stimulation over the prefrontal cortex of depressive patients affects antidepressant outcome.,"Isserles, Moshe; Rosenberg, Oded; Dannon, Pinchas; Levkovitz, Yechiel; Kotler, Moshe; Deutsch, Frederic; Lerer, Bernard; Zangen, Abraham",BACKGROUND: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) enables non-surgical activation of specific brain areas. TMS over the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is emerging as a significant tool that can augment or replace non/partially effective antidepressant medications. Deep TMS (DTMS) utilizes newly developed coils that enable effective stimulation of deeper cortical layers involved in the pathophysiology of depression. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the H1-DTMS coil as an add-on to antidepressants in treating patients with major depression. We also intended to evaluate whether the antidepressant outcome of DTMS treatment is affected by a cognitive-emotional procedure performed during stimulation. METHODS: 57 patients were enrolled in the study that included 4 weeks of daily 20 Hz stimulation sessions and additional 4 weekly sessions as a short maintenance phase. Two subgroups of patients received either positive or negative cognitive-emotional reactivation along with the stimulation sessions. RESULTS: 21 of 46 patients (46 \% ) who received at least 10 stimulation sessions achieved response (improvement of \textgreater /= 50 \% in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS)) and 13 of them (28 \% ) achieved remission (HDRS-24 \textless /= 10) by the end of the daily treatment phase. Improvements were smaller in the negatively reactivated group and Beck Depression Inventory scores were not significantly improved in this group. CONCLUSIONS: DTMS over the PFC proved to be safe and effective in augmenting antidepressant medications. Negative cognitive-emotional reactivation can disrupt the therapeutic effect of DTMS. A large sham controlled study is required to further establish the effectiveness of DTMS as an augmentation treatment and the role of cognitive reactivation during stimulation.,2011.0,10.1016/j.jad.2010.06.038,9PMNMIDN,0,cognitive,27
27,Reminiscence Therapy Improves Cognitive Functions and Reduces Depressive Symptoms in Elderly People With Dementia: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Huang, Hui-Chuan; Chen, Yu-Ting; Chen, Pin-Yuan and","OBJECTIVE: Cognitive function impairments and depressive symptoms are common in elderly people with dementia. Previous meta-analyses of outdated and small-scale studies have reported inconsistent results regarding the effects of reminiscence therapy on cognitive functions and depressive symptoms; therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis by including more recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with large sample sizes to investigate the immediate and long-term (6-10 months) effects of reminiscence therapy on cognitive functions and depressive symptoms in elderly people with dementia. REVIEW METHODS: Electronic databases, including PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ProQuest, Google Scholar, and Chinese databases were searched to select eligible articles. Primary outcome measures included the scores of cognitive functions and depressive symptoms. In total, 12 RCT studies investigating the effects of reminiscence therapy on cognitive functions and depressive symptoms in elderly people with dementia were included. Two reviewers independently extracted data. All analyses were performed using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Reminiscence therapy had a small-size effect on cognitive functions (g = 0.18, 95 \% confidence interval [CI] 0.05-0.30) and a moderate-size effect on depressive symptoms (g = -0.49, 95 \% CI -0.70 to -0.28) in elderly people with dementia. Long-term effects of reminiscence therapy on cognitive functions and depressive symptoms were not confirmed. Moderator analysis revealed that institutionalized elderly people with dementia exhibited greater improvement in depressive symptoms than community-dwelling people with dementia did (g = -0.59 vs. -0.16, P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis confirms that reminiscence therapy is effective in improving cognitive functions and depressive symptoms in elderly people with dementia. Our findings suggest that regular reminiscence therapy should be considered for inclusion as routine care for the improvement of cognitive functions and depressive symptoms in elderly people with dementia, particularly in institutionalized residents with dementia.",2015.0,10.1016/j.jamda.2015.07.010,7Q65NY92,0,cognitive,28
28,The empathic wall and the ecology of affect.,"Nathanson, Donald L.","The nature and significance of affect and of affective transmission are examined, and a new ego mechanism, called the empathic wall, is described to explain the organism's adaptation to affective resonance. It is suggested that the earliest form of communication is the sharing of affect; the infant needs some way of differentiating between affect experienced as the result of (maternal) transmission and that resulting from purely inner sources. The empathic wall mechanism provides a primitive form of affect blocking and allows attribution of experienced affect either to subject or object, thus providing the substrate on which both denial and projection are formed. The psychoanalytic understanding of empathy is reviewed in terms of the empathic wall. Clinical material is provided to demonstrate the use of this concept in the understanding of patients and in therapy.

29,Family therapy and work with relatives in various psychiatric diseases .,"Wiedemann, G.; Buchkremer, G.","The use of family therapy and relatives' groups in various areas of psychiatry, e.g. schizophrenia, affective disorders, eating disorders, dependency disorders, psychogeriatrics, and adolescent and child psychiatry, is discussed. These forms of therapy have continued to increase in popularity, although relatively few controlled studies of their effectiveness had been undertaken until quite recently. For each disorder, the most frequently employed types of therapy are compared with each other on the basis of controlled studies of efficacy. More flexible combinations and integrated approaches are constantly being developed. These rely less on particular methods of treatment than on the patients themselves, their illnesses, and their attitudes towards their mental states and social environments. A few of these treatment strategies are discussed, and their most important features described. Controlled studies have provided increasing evidence of the efficacy of family therapy and relatives' groups in respect of various criteria: relapse rate, psychopathology, symptoms, quality of life (both of the patients and of their relatives), social integration, and subjective well-being, amongst others. The effectiveness of such treatment in many areas requires further investigation, for example in chronic mental illness and psychogeriatric disorders, which represent fields of ever-increasing interest. More basic research and continued assessment of the methods employed in practice will be required to clarify further the underlying principles and the best framework for carrying out family therapy and relatives' group sessions, and thereby develop successful methods of treatment based on firm theoretical principles.",1996.0,,R7FAA7E2,0,cognitive,30

OBJECTIVES: We sought to identify the factors associated with patients' sense of security during the palliative care period. METHODS: We recruited 174 adult patients (65 \% of those eligible) from six palliative home care units. The relationship between the patients' sense of security during palliative care and individual factors was evaluated in a stepwise procedure using the generalized linear model (ordinal multinomial distribution and logit link). RESULTS: Respondents' ratings of their sense of security ranged from 1 (never) to 6 (always), with a mean value of 4.6 (SD 1.19). Patients with lower feelings of security experienced higher stress; more worry about personal finances; lower feelings of self-efficacy; a lower sense of security with the palliative care provided (lower ratings on subscales of care interaction); mastery; prevailed own identity; higher symptom intensity (especially depression, anxiety, and lack of well-being); lower health-related quality of life; lower attachment anxiety and avoidance; less support from family, relatives, and friends; lower comfort for those closest to them; and more often had gynecological cancer. Six variables (mastery, nervousness and stress, gynecological cancer, self-efficacy, worrying about personal finances, and avoidance) were selected in building the stepwise model. CONCLUSION: These findings stress the importance of palliative care services in supporting dying patients' sense of security through symptom management with a wide scope and through supporting the patients' sense of mastery, identity, and perception of a secure care interaction and also through attention to the family members' situation.",2014.0,10/f23x7z,VDJZNQLU,0,psychodynamic,31

32,Review of Depression as a psychoanalytic problem.,"Gibbs, Patricia L.","Reviews the book, Depression as a Psychoanalytic Problem by Thomas H. Ogden (2014). In his comprehensive and well-researched book, Paolo Azzone takes a historical look at depression. He starts by reviewing the Ancient Greeks and the philosophy of the Hellenistic and Roman imperial periods. Of interest to academics and historians will be the relevant historical documents that Azzone selects to build his book's premises. Early in the book, then, the reader will begin to appreciate Azzone's historical compilation of humanity's attempts to understand, diagnose, and treat depression-even if some readers disagree with Azzone's conclusions. At a later point in the book, it will be clear that the author is championing a psychoanalytic conceptualization of humanity, suffering, and depression that is not at all confined to the measurable, rational, predictable, or concrete. From here Azzone precedes to develop his theory and treatment of depression, starting with an emphasis on the affect most associated with depression: sadness. His conclusion that there must be a theory-driven, relevant description of depressive disorders has been carefully argued to this point in his book. This book highly recommend Azzone's book to all clinicians. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",,,EUGH557V,0,psychodynamic,33
33,"Exposure to Terrorism, Stress-Related Mental Health Symptoms, and Coping Behaviors among a Nationally Representative Sample in Israel","Bleich, A.; Gelkopf, M.; Solomon, Z.","Context: The terrorist attacks on Israeli society have been ongoing since September 2000. However, few studies have examined the impact of terrorism on nationally representative population samples, and no study has examined the psychological impact of ongoing terrorism in Israel. Objectives: To determine the level of exposure to terrorist attacks and the prevalence of traumatic stress-related (TSR) symptoms, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and sense of safety after 19 months of terrorism in Israel, and to identify correlates of the psychological sequelae and the modes of coping with the terrorism. Design, Setting, and Participants: Telephone survey conducted April-May 2002, using a strata sampling method, of 902 eligible households and a representative sample of 742 Israeli residents older than 18 years (82 \% contact rate) and a final participation of 512 (57 \% ). Main Outcome Measures: Number of TSR symptoms, rates of those with symptom criteria for PTSD and acute stress disorder assessed by the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire, self-reported feelings of depression, optimism, sense of safety, help-seeking, and modes of coping. Results: Of 512 survey participants, 84 (16.4 \% ) had been directly exposed to a terrorist attack and 191 (37.3 \% ) had a family member or friend who had been exposed. Of 510 participants who responded to questions about TSR symptoms, 391 (76.7 \% ) had at least 1 TSR symptom (mean, 4.0 [SD, 4.5] ; range, 0-23; mean intensity, 0.8; range, 0-4). Symptom criteria for PTSD were met by 48 participants (9.4 \% ) and criteria for acute stress disorder, by 1 participant; 299 (58.6 \% ) reported feeling depressed. The majority of respondents expressed optimism about their personal future (421/512 [82.2 \% ]) and the future of Israel (307/509 [66.8 \% ]), and expressed self-efficacy with regard to their ability to function in a terrorist attack (322/431 [74.6 \% ]). Most expressed a low sense of safety with respect to themselves (307/509 [60.4 \% ]) and their relatives (345/507 [67.9 \% ]). Few reported a need for professional help (27/ 506 [5.3 \% ]). Female sex, sense of safety, and use of tranquilizers, alcohol, and cigarettes to cope were associated with TSR symptoms and symptom criteria for PTSD; level of exposure and objective risk were not. The most prevalent coping mechanisms were active information search about loved ones and social support. Conclusions: Considering the nature and length of the Israeli traumatic experience, the psychological impact may be considered moderate. Although the survey participants showed distress and lowered sense of safety, they did not develop high levels of psychiatric distress, which may be related to a habituation process and to coping mechanisms.",2003.0,10.1001/jama.290.5.612,EPQNDSZX,0,diathesis,34
34,Exposure to peer suicide in college students.,"Watkins, Robin Lynn","Exposure to peer suicide among young people has been identified as a potential risk factor for suicide-related behavior, but it has also been the subject of conflicting research and is not well understood. The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between exposure to peer suicide in college students and subsequent risk for suicide-related behavior and depression. The association between the level of closeness to the suicide victim and subsequent risk for suicide-related behavior and depression was also examined. Social support and current life stress were investigated as two potential moderating factors. Three hundred seventy college undergraduate students who were recruited from Introductory Psychology courses at Northern Illinois University participated in this study. After those who had been exposed to non-peer or non-recent peer suicides (n = 67), those with invalid protocols resulting from failure to complete one or more measures (n = 29), and those who were not between the ages of 18 and 20 (n = 14) were deleted from the sample, a total sample of 260 remained. Of these participants, 50 had been recently exposed to the suicide of a peer, as defined by the study criteria. Participants completed a Demographic Questionnaire, an Exposure Questionnaire to determine exposure status, the Peer Relationship Scale to determine relationship between survivor and victim, and the College Student Social Support Scale and Life Experiences Survey as measures of the moderating variables and the Adult Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire, Beck Hopelessness Scale, Reasons for Living Inventory for Young Adults, Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire, and Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition as the dependent measures. The findings suggest that exposure is associated with increased suicidal ideation and behavior, as well as depressive symptomatology, but only when survivors have high levels of concurrent or subsequent life stress. These results lend support to a diathesis-stress conceptualization of the relationship between exposure and risk. Closeness to the suicide victim was not a significant predictor of suicide risk or depressive symptoms. Based on the present results, it appears that the discrepancies in the literature may have been due to the presence of the unrecognized moderating variable of life stress.

METHODS: Data from the Pittsburgh Girls Study were analyzed. All girls were 17 years old. Girls were included if they were not missing self-reported sexual orientation and mental health data (N = 527). Thirty-one girls (6 \ \% \ ) endorsed same-sex romantic orientation/identity or current same-sex attraction. Bivariate analyses were conducted to test group differences in the prevalence of substance use and suicidal behavior, and group differences in depression, anxiety, borderline personality disorder (BPD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and conduct disorder (CD) symptoms. RESULTS: Compared with heterosexual girls, sexual minority girls reported higher past-year rates of cigarette, alcohol, and heavy alcohol use, higher rates of suicidal ideation and self-harm, and higher average depression, anxiety, BPD, ODD, and CD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Sexual minority girls are an underrepresented group in the health disparities literature, and compared with heterosexual girls, they are at higher risk for mental health problems, most likely because of minority stress experiences such as discrimination and victimization. The disparities found in this report highlight the importance of discussing sexual orientation as part of a comprehensive preventive care visit.",2012.0,10.1016/j.jpag.2011.06.011,IWH8MYXA,0,personality,36

T.; Ekeberg","Background: Despite an increased risk of suicide among physicians we lack studies on prevalence and predictors of suicidal ideation among medical students and young doctors. Method: A prospective study of Norwegian medical students (n = 522) re-examined after the first postgraduate year, comprising suicidal thoughts and attempts, perceived study stress, job stress, and personality. Results: The previous year prevalence of suicidal thoughts was 14 \% at both points of time. The lifetime prevalence was 43 \% , while 8 \% had planned suicide, and 1.4 \% had attempted suicide. Suicidal ideation in medical school was predicted by lack of control, personality trait, single marital status, negative life events and mental distress (anxiety and depression). In the first postgraduate year, mental distress was the most important predictor, but before controlling for this variable, job stress, vulnerability (neuroticism), single status, and less working hours were independent predictors. Prospectively, suicidal thoughts and vulnerability as student predicted postgraduate suicidal ideation. Conclusions: The level of suicidal thoughts was high, but the level of attempts was low. Clinical implications: Preventive efforts should be directed both at the students' abilities to cope with stress and at mental health services for young doctors. Limitations of study: The lower response rate at follow-up (57 \% ) may reduce external validity. \textcopyright 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",2001.0,10.1016/S0165-0327(00)00205-6,ZQ9V2SJG,0,personality,37

This study investigated the direct and moderational influence of affectively laden phrases in cancer risk messages. Two experimental studies were conducted in relation to different cancer-related behaviors--sunbed use (n = 112) and red meat consumption (n = 447)--among student and nonstudent samples. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (a) a cognitive message using cognitively laden phrases or (b) an affective message using affectively laden phrases. The results revealed that affective phrases did not directly influence feelings of risk in both studies. Evidence for a moderational influence was found in Study 2, suggesting that affective information strengthened the relation between feelings of risk and intention (i.e., participants relied more on their feelings in the decision-making process after exposure to affective information). These findings suggest that solely using affective phrases in risk communication may not be sufficient to directly influence feelings of risk and other methods need to be explored in future research. Moreover, research is needed to replicate our preliminary indications for a moderational influence of affective phrases to advance theory and practice.",2015.0,10.1080/10810730.2014.965362,3ML6SWGM,0,behavior,38

The aims of this study were to use data from an ongoing Australian longitudinal cohort study to (1) compare different measures of workplace bullying, (2) estimate the prevalence of bullying and ill-treatment at work, (3) evaluate whether workplace bullying is distinct from other adverse work characteristics and (4) examine the unique contribution of workplace bullying to common mental disorders in mid-life. Method: The sample comprised 1466 participants (52 \% women) aged 52-58 from wave four of the Personality and Total Health (PATH) through Life study. Workplace bullying was assessed by a single item of self-labelling measure of bullying and a 15-item scale of bullying-related behaviours experienced in the past 6 months. Factor analysis the identified underlying factor structure of the behavioural bullying scale. Results: Current bullying was reported by 7.0 \% of respondents, while 46.4 \% of respondents reported that they had been bullied at some point in their working life. Person-related and work-related bullying behaviours were more common than violence and intimidation. The multi-dimensional scale of bullying behaviours had greater concordance with a single item of self-labelled bullying (Area Under the Curve = 0.88) than other adverse work characteristics (all Area Under the Curves \textless 0.67). Self-labelled bullying and scales reflecting person-related and work-related bullying were independent predictors of depression and/or anxiety. Conclusion: This study provides unique information on the prevalence and mental health impacts of workplace bullying and ill-treatment in Australia. Workplace bullying is a relatively common experience, and is associated with increased risk of depression and anxiety. Greater attention to identifying and preventing bullying and ill-treatment in the workplace is warranted.",2016.0,10.1177/0004867415622267,73NU3TCP,0,cognitive_additional,39

Methods: We measured SAA, CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α in plasma samples from 89 adult psychiatric out-patients by multiplex, high-sensitivity electrochemiluminescent assays. Psychiatric symptoms were evaluated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Results: Plasma SAA was most robustly associated with depressive symptoms across diagnostic boundaries in this cohort of out-patients. Elevated SAA was significantly associated with higher total scores on the HAMD-17 scale and correlated with multiple scale items that rated symptoms of fatigue and depressed mood, but not with anxiety-related items. Conclusions: SAA might constitute a cross-diagnostic marker indicative of depressed mood and fatigue in a naturalistic patient setting. Because SAA activates Toll-like receptors 2 and 4, present on macrophages and glial cells, its association with depression severity could also implicate this inflammatory mediator in the pathogenesis of mood disorders.",2017.0,10.1111/acps.12730,6BYEDF7M,0,additional,41
41,"On narcissism, aggressivity and anti-Semitism.","Grunberger, Bela","Describes anti-Semitic propaganda as the product of non-Jewish religions and ideologies that stem from the narcissistic wish for omnipotence and the belief that Jews represent the order of the oedipal Father. The oedipal features of Judaism include the creation of the superego and of God, the Father. The dominant features of Christianity derive affective charge from primary narcissism and represent a challenge to the order of the Father because the Son and the Mother are the objects of narcissistic cathexis. Non-Jewish religion and ideology allow narcissists to identify with a global narcissistic fantasy and use reactional agressivity by attacking Jews as the first herald of oedipal authority that drove them from the paradise in which they merged with the Mother. The divide is not between Jews and non-Jews, but between the narcissist and the oedipal.

Postpartum mothering involves automatic and attentional processes to screen out new external as well as internal stimuli. The present study investigated sensorimotor gating in relation to sleep duration, depression, as well as catecholaminergic and oxytocinergic genotypes in postpartum women.Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex and startle reactivity were assessed two months postpartum in 141 healthy and 29 depressed women. The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met, and oxytocin receptor (OXTR) rs237885 and rs53576 polymorphisms were genotyped, and data on sleep duration were collected.Short sleep duration (less than four hours in the preceding night) and postpartum depression were independently associated with lower PPI. Also, women with postpartum depression had higher startle reactivity in comparison with controls. The OXTR rs237885 genotype was related to PPI in an allele dose-dependent mode, with T/T healthy postpartum women carriers displaying the lowest PPI.Reduced sensorimotor gating was associated with sleep deprivation and depressive symptoms during the postpartum period. Individual neurophysiological vulnerability might be mediated by oxytocinergic genotype which relates to bonding and stress response. These findings implicate the putative relevance of lower PPI of the startle response as an objective physiological correlate of liability to postpartum depression.",2016.0,10.1016/j.euroneuro.2016.01.002,AN7HM5RR,0,diathesis,43

A.; True, W. R.; Tsuang, M.; Bucholz, K. K.; Koenen, K. C.","Combat exposure is associated with increased risk of psychiatric and substance use disorders in veterans. However, it is not known whether combat exposure independently increases risk for these disorders or whether this association is accounted for by genetic vulnerability common to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This article tests competing explanations for the association of combat exposure and PTSD with nicotine dependence (ND), alcohol dependence (AD), and major depression (MD). Data were obtained from 6099 members of the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, a national registry of male-male twin pairs who served in the military during the Vietnam era. Twin models were fit to estimate the genetic and environmental variance common and specific to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition, lifetime diagnoses of PTSD, combat trauma, and 3 comorbid conditions: ND, AD, and MD. Variance specific to ND, AD, and MD was due to genetic factors (48 \% , 36 \% , and 12 \% , respectively) and unique environmental factors (36 \% , 42 \% , and 58 \% , respectively). After accounting for variance common to PTSD, no residual genetic and environmental variance overlapped between combat and ND, combat and AD, and combat and MD. Combat exposure is not independently associated with lifetime ND, AD, and MD. The association of combat exposure with these 3 disorders is due to genetic and unique environmental contributions in common with PTSD. These findings suggest comorbid PTSD may represent a genetically mediated vulnerability to psychopathology after trauma. \textcopyright 2008 Elsevier Inc.

44,The influence of thoughts of death and suicidal ideation on the course of depression in older depressed patients,"Bogers, I. C.; Zuidersma, M.; Boshuisen, M. L.; Comijs, H. C. and","Objective: Thoughts of death are not regularly included in diagnostic instruments and rarely examined separately from thoughts of suicide. This exploratory study examined whether thoughts of death and thoughts of suicide affect the course of late-life depressive disorders. Methods: In 378 depressed older persons, thoughts of death and thoughts of suicide were assessed using questions from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. After 2years, the presence of a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of minor or major depression or dysthymia was assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology was administered every 6months up till 3-year follow-up. Results: Multinomial logistic regression showed that thoughts of death as well as thoughts of suicide predicted double depression at follow-up (OR=2.14 [95 \% CI: 1.04-4.40] and OR=6.47 [95 \% CI: 2.22-3.02], respectively), compared with patients without these thoughts. Results became non-significant when adjusted for baseline depression severity (OR=1.17 [95 \% CI: 0.52-2.63] and OR=2.57 [95 \% CI: 0.79-8.84], respectively). Mixed linear models showed that severity of depression was lowest in the reference group, while symptoms decreased more over time in those with either thoughts of death or suicide. Conclusions: Patients with thoughts of death or with thoughts of suicide were more severely depressed at baseline and follow-up, with the highest risk of being depressed at follow-up for patients with thoughts of suicide. These associations could be explained by baseline depression severity. The results suggest that thoughts of death and thoughts of suicide are important risk markers in predicting the course of depression.",2016.0,10.1002/gps.4541,8Z4QZVRL,0,cognitive_additional,45

The South Oaks Gambling Screen, the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90-R) and the Temperament and Character Inventory-R were administered to a large sample of 1632 outpatients attending a specialized outpatient GD unit. Sociodemographic variables were also recorded. A Structural Equation Model was adjusted to assess the pathway. Age of onset mediated between personality profile (novelty seeking and self-transcendence) and GD severity and depression symptoms (measured by SCL-90-R). Sex had a direct effect on GD onset and depression symptoms: men initiated the GD earlier and reported fewer depression symptoms. Age of onset is a mediating variable between sex, personality traits, GD severity and depression symptoms. These empirical results provide new evidence about the underlying etiological process of dysfunctional behaviors related to gambling, and may help to guide the development of more effective treatment and prevention programs aimed at high-risk groups such as young men with high levels of novelty seeking and self-transcendence.",2016.0,10.1007/s10899-015-9537-y,VE3X9K9Y,0,personality,46
46,Affective self-regulation trajectories during secondary school predict substance use among urban minority young adults.,"Griffin, Kenneth W.; Lowe, Sarah R.; Acevedo, Bianca P.; Botvin, Gilbert J.","This study explored the relationship between trajectories of affective self-regulation skills during secondary school and young adult substance use in a large multiethnic, urban sample (N = 995). During secondary school, participants completed a measure of cognitive and behavioral skills used to control negative, unpleasant emotions or perceived stress. As young adults, participants reported on the frequency and quantity of their alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use in a telephone interview. Controlling for demographic variables, self-regulation did not significantly change over adolescence, although there was significant variation in participants' rates of growth and decline. Lower seventh-grade self-regulation and less steep increases in self-regulation were predictive of higher young adult substance use. Male participants had significantly lower initial self-regulation and higher young adult substance use. The results suggest that interventions that build affective self-regulation skills in adolescence may decrease the risk of young adult substance use.

METHOD: The TADS, a multisite clinical trial, randomized 439 adolescents with major depressive disorder to 12 weeks of treatment with fluoxetine, cognitive-behavioral therapy, their combination, or pill placebo. The pill placebo group, treated openly after week 12, was not included in the subsequent analyses. Treatment differences in remission rates and probabilities of remission over time are compared. Recovery rates in remitters at weeks 12 (acute phase remitters) and 18 (continuation phase remitters) are summarized. We also examined whether residual symptoms at the end of 12 weeks of acute treatment predicted later remission. RESULTS: At week 36, the estimated remission rates for intention-to-treat cases were as follows: combination, 60 \% ; fluoxetine, 55 \% ; cognitive-behavioral therapy, 64 \% ; and overall, 60 \% . Paired comparisons reveal that, at week 24, all active treatments converge on remission outcomes. The recovery rate at week 36 was 65 \% for acute phase remitters and 71 \% for continuation phase remitters, with no significant between-treatment differences in recovery rates. Residual symptoms at the end of acute treatment predicted failure to achieve remission at weeks 18 and 36. CONCLUSIONS: Most depressed adolescents in all three treatment modalities achieved remission at the end of 9 months of treatment.",2009.0,10.1097/CHI.0b013e31819176f9,9T9SGNJX,0,cognitive,48
48,Dynamic molecular and anatomical changes in the glucocorticoid receptor in human cortical development,"Sinclair, D.; Webster, M. J.; Wong, J.; Weickert, C. S.","The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) has a critical role in determining the brain's capacity to respond to stress, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of psychiatric illness. We hypothesized that key changes in cortical GR occur during adolescence and young adulthood, at a time when individuals are at increased risk of developing schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression. We investigated the mRNA and protein expression of GR in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex across seven developmental time points from infancy to adulthood. GR mRNA expression, determined by microarray and quantitative real-time PCR, was lowest in neonates and peaked around young adulthood. Western blotting revealed two dynamic patterns of GR$\alpha$ protein expression across the lifespan, with N-terminal variants displaying differing unique patterns of abundance. GR$\alpha$-A and a 67-kDa GR$\alpha$ isoform mirrored mRNA trends and peaked in toddlers and late in adolescence, whereas a 40-kDa isoform, very likely a GR$\alpha$-D variant, peaked in neonates and decreased across the lifespan. GR$\alpha$ protein was localized to pyramidal neurons throughout life and most strikingly in young adulthood, but to white matter astrocytes only in neonates and infants (130 days). These results suggest that the neonatal and late adolescent periods represent critical windows of stress pathway development, and highlight the importance of white matter astrocytes and pyramidal neurons, respectively, at these stages of cortical development. Evidence of dynamic patterns of GR isoform expression and cellular localization across development strengthens the hypothesis that windows of vulnerability to stress exist across human cortical development. \textcopyright 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",2011.0,10.1038/mp.2010.28,EBMV3SD2,0,diathesis,49
49,The structure of problem and positive behavior among American Indian adolescents: gender and community differences.,"Mitchell, C. M.; Beals, J.","Using Problem-Behavior Theory as framework, the latent structure of problem and positive behaviors was examined within a sample of 1,894 American Indian adolescents. Support was found for a two-factor second-order structure in which problem behaviors (antisocial behavior, alcohol use, drug use, and risky sexual behavior) and positive behaviors (school success, cultural activities, competencies, and community-mindedness) represented two relatively uncorrelated aspects of behavior. Hierarchical multiple regressions demonstrated that the positive behaviors construct contributed significant incremental construct validity in the statistical prediction of psychosocial outcomes, over and above the problem behaviors. In addition, the fit of the structure was examined across gender and the four participating communities. The importance of the inclusion of positive behaviors is discussed from the standpoint of both prevention/promotion activities and the communities' perceptions. Further recommendations are made for deeper understandings of community concerns and strengths in conducting preventive/promotive research efforts.",1997.0,,46PQ99AT,0,behavior,50

P.; Srbye; Sjaastad, Mary Cosgrove; Heyerdahl, Oscar","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to measure the effects of transference interpretations (the assumed core active ingredient) in dynamic psychotherapy, using an experimental design. METHOD: One hundred patients were randomly assigned to two groups. One group received dynamic psychotherapy over 1 year, with a moderate level of transference interpretations, while the other group received dynamic psychotherapy with no transference interpretations. The most common axis I disorders were depression and anxiety disorders. Forty-six patients fulfilled the general criteria for personality disorder. Seven experienced psychotherapists treated patients in both groups. Five full sessions from each treatment were rated by two evaluators with process measures in order to document treatment integrity. Outcome variables were the Psychodynamic Functioning Scales, Inventory of Interpersonal Problems Scale-Circumplex version, Global Assessment of Functioning Scale, and Symptom Checklist-90-R. Quality of Object Relations Scale (lifelong pattern) and personality disorders were preselected as possible moderators of treatment effects. Change was assessed using linear-mixed models. Clinically significant change was also calculated. RESULTS: The authors could not demonstrate differential treatment effects between the groups. However, the moderator analyses showed that transference interpretations were more helpful for patients with a lifelong history of less mature object relations. Small negative effects were observed for patients with mature object relations. CONCLUSIONS: The authors could not show differences in average effectiveness between treatments. However, the moderator analyses indicated that treatment worked through different active ingredients for different patients. Contrary to common expectation, patients with poor object relations profited more from therapy with transference interpretations than from therapy with no transference interpretations.",2006.0,10.1176/ajp.2006.163.10.1739,75MN2BM2,0,personality,51

M.","pH and bicarbonate affect many metabolic reactions but each may change independently. To study bicarbonate's effect onplasma potassium, blood bicarbonate in normal, hypokalemic or hyperkalemic rats was either maintained constant, lowered by hydrochloric acid or raised by sodium bicarbonate administraion. Blood pH was maintained constant by changing PCO2. In normokalemia lowering bicarbonate increased plasma potassium 2.0mEq above values obtained in the other groups. To eliminate urinary potassium losses, experiments were also performed in rats with bilateral ureteral ligation. Again, plasma potassium concentration rose significantly more in the lowered bicarbonate group. Similarly, in hypokalemia, plasma potassium rose 1.2 and 0.4mEq in the lowered and unchanged groups, but fell 0.2mEq/liter in the elevated group. Differences could not be ascribed to renal potassium losses as potassium excretion was essentially zero in each group. In hyperkalemia, plasma potassium concentration remained elevated for 150 min in the lowered bicarbonate group but fell 1.3 and 2.0mEq in the unchanged and elevated groups, respectively. Urinary potassium losses in the three groups were statistically identical. In all experiments blood pH was maintained unchanged during the experiment. The data show that bicarbonate, independent of blood pH, alters transcellular potassium distribution suggesting the usefulness of bicarbonate therapy in hyperkalemia even at a compensated blood pH.",2008.0,10.1186/1472-6963-8-99,I6P2KA43,0,behavior,52

This study investigates the prevalence of suicidal ideation in a population of inpatients with acute schizophrenia, together with the clinical parameters associated with suicidal thoughts. METHOD: We assessed 93 schizophrenia patients. We matched subjects for age and sex and compared subjects with and without suicidal thoughts. We performed stepwise multiple regression analysis to assess the association between specific clinical symptoms and suicidal ideation. RESULTS: Of the patients, 20.4 \% reported suicidal thoughts during the last 15 days. Severity of depressive symptoms, motor retardation, guilt feelings, pathological guilt, and self-depreciation predicted the patients' suicidal ideation.

Prevention of suicidal behaviour should include helping patients improve their self-esteem and reducing depression and guilt feelings.",2004.0,,X5JJKT3L,0,psychodynamic,54
54,The perpetrators of medical child abuse (Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy) - A systematic review of 796 cases,"Yates, G.; Bass, C.","INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the perpetrators of medical child abuse (MCA) which is often described as ""Munchausen's syndrome by proxy"" or ""factitious disorder imposed on another"". The demographic and clinical characteristics of these abusers have yet to be described in a sufficiently large sample. We aimed to address this issue through a systematic review of case reports and series in the professional literature. METHOD: A systematic search for case reports and series published since 1965 was undertaken using MEDLINE, Web of Science and EMBASE. 4100 database records were screened. A supplementary search was then conducted using GoogleScholar and reference lists of eligible studies. Our search yielded a total sample of 796 perpetrators: 309 from case reports and 487 from case series. Information extracted included demographic and clinical characteristics, in addition to methods of abuse and case outcomes. RESULTS: Nearly all abusers were female (97.6%) and the victim's mother (95.6%). Most were married (75.8%). Mean caretaker age at the child's presentation was 27.6 years. Perpetrators were frequently reported to be in healthcare-related professions (45.6%), to have had obstetric complications (23.5%), or to have histories of childhood maltreatment (30%). The most common psychiatric diagnoses recorded were factitious disorder imposed on self (30.9%), personality disorder (18.6%), and depression (14.2%). CONCLUSIONS: From the largest analysis of MCA perpetrators to date, we provide several clinical recommendations. In particular, we urge clinicians to consider mothers with a personal history of childhood maltreatment, obstetric complications, and/or factitious disorder at heightened risk for MCA. Longitudinal studies are required to establish the true prognostic value of these factors as our method may have been vulnerable to publication bias.",2017.0,10/gcz5v2,2YMBTJHE,0,additional,55

The authors assessed the physical health of these Ss 6-30 mo after entry into the project. Ss in the seminar group had better physical health than did control Ss: fewer self-reported symptoms of physical illness, fewer doctors' visits overall, and fewer illness-related visits to Student Health. They were more likely to visit a doctor for a checkup and had healthier habits of diet and exercise. The authors postulate that the learning of antidepression skills produces better physical health.

56,"Gender differences in self-efficacy, behavior change, and psychological distress in a behavioral weight loss program.","Thorp, Cynthia Marlena","Studies on the psychological status of obese individuals who seek treatment have demonstrated different motivational and psychological outcomes in males and females. Although self-efficacy has received increasing attention as a mediating factor in weight loss, there are few studies examining this relationship between genders. Research on obesity treatment has also linked increased psychological distress in women, while measures of psychopathology may be differentially affected by degree of obesity in men. The purpose of the present study was to examine gender differences in weight control self-efficacy, psychological distress, BMI, and change in weight control behaviors. The study tested four hypotheses examining both self-efficacy and psychological distress (measured as depression, anxiety, and somatization) in a prospective quasi-experimental design. Participants were recruited from an obese clinical population within a multidisciplinary behavioral weight management intervention (N = 70, 83 \% female). Results indicate that both groups significantly improved global self-efficacy scores by 24 \% from pretest to posttest, and psychological distress scores decreased by 44 \% from pretest to posttest. While the results of this study support previous findings on the impact of self-efficacy on weight management and success of the current intervention, the study failed to find statistically significant differences between genders in both measures of weight loss self-efficacy or psychological distress. The results of this study indicate that the Kaiser Permanente Healthy Ways (HW) Medical Weight Management Program intervention did have a significant impact on both males and females. The HW intervention helped to increase self-efficacy and weight control behaviors, while decreasing psychological distress and BMI. Implications for further research are discussed.

M.; Shorten, G.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Prospective longitudinal studies now indicate that cognitive dysfunction following coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) is both common and persistent. This dysfunction is due in part to the inflammatory response and cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion, with nitric oxide (NO) as an important mediator of both. We hypothesized that a clinically significant association exists between plasma concentrations of nitrate/nitrite (NO3-/NO2-) and cognitive dysfunction after CABG. METHODS: Cognitive assessment was performed on 36 adult patients the day before CABG, on the fourth postoperative day and 3 months postoperatively. Patient spouses (n = 10) were also studied. RESULTS: A new cognitive deficit was present in 22/36 (62 \% ) 4 days postoperatively and in 16/35 (49 \% ) of patients, 3 months postoperatively. Patients who had cognitive dysfunction 3 months postoperatively were more likely to have cognitive dysfunction and increased plasma NO3-/NO2- concentrations compared to the non-deficit group preoperatively (22.6 (9.2) vs. 27.6 (8.4)) (P = 0.002). Plasma NOx (NO3- plus NO2-) concentrations were greater in patients with cognitive dysfunction 3 months postoperatively, 2 h (24.2 (6.3) vs. 19.1 (5.2)) (P = 0.002), and 12 h postoperatively (24.8 (7.6) vs. 18.8 (5.6)) (P = 0.001). There was, however, a time course similarity in NOx elevations for both deficit and non-deficit groups.

Interventions may be more effective in improving self-care if they mobilize support from providers, promote self-efficacy, increase understanding of HF, increase the family involvement, and are individualized. All of these elements are emphasized in motivational interviewing (MI); few trials have been conducted using MI in HF patients and rarely have caregivers been involved in MI interventions. The aim of this study will be to evaluate if MI improves self-care maintenance in HF patients, and to determine if MI improves the following secondary outcomes: a) in HF patients: self-care management, self-care confidence, symptom perception, quality of life, anxiety/depression, cognition, sleep quality, mutuality with caregiver, hospitalizations, use of emergency services, and mortality; b) in caregivers: caregiver contribution to self-care, quality of life, anxiety/depression, sleep, mutuality with patient, preparedness, and social support. METHODS: A three-arm randomized controlled trial will be conducted in a sample of 240 HF patients and caregivers. Patients and caregivers will be randomized to the following arms: 1) MI intervention to patients only; 2) MI intervention to patients and caregivers; 3) standard of care to patients and caregivers. The primary outcome will be measured in patients 3months after enrollment. Primary and secondary outcomes also will be evaluated 6, 9 and 12months after enrollment. CONCLUSION: This study will contribute to understand if MI provided to patients and caregivers can improve self-care.

59,Perinatal mental health in lesbian mothers: A review of potential risk and protective factors,"Ross, L. E.","Postpartum depression and other perinatal mental illnesses are common complications of childbirth. The majority of research on these conditions has been conducted in heterosexual women; however, increasing numbers of women are choosing to parent in the context of lesbian relationships. Although many of the fundamental aspects of the transition to parenthood are shared between lesbian and heterosexual mothers, lesbian mothers may differ from heterosexual parents on a number of variables that have been previously associated with perinatal mental health. Lesbian mothers may be more likely than their heterosexual peers to lack social support, particularly from their families of origin, and may be exposed to additional stress due to homophobic discrimination. However, the likelihood that lesbian pregnancies will be planned, together with the relatively equal division of child- care labour observed in lesbian couples, may offer protection from perinatal depression. The study of perinatal mental health in lesbian mothers is warranted, both to ensure that the mental health needs of this largely invisible population are being met, and to further illuminate the role of psychosocial stress in perinatal mental health in all women. \textcopyright 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

J.; Schene, Aart H.","BACKGROUND: Maintenance antidepressant (AD) medication is the most commonly used preventive strategy in a highly recurrent disease, i.e. depression. Little is known about the discontinuation of maintenance AD use and the association with recurrence in daily clinical practice. The purpose was to examine the discontinuation rate of maintenance AD in daily clinical practice in recurrently depressed patients and the associated risk of recurrence. METHODS: Prospectively AD maintenance medication and recurrence were examined in 172 euthymic patients with recurrent depression. AD user profiles before recurrence (nonusers, intermittent users, continuous users) were examined and related to recurrence over a 2-year follow-up period. RESULTS: Less than half of the patients (42 \% ) used AD continuously. Taking into account the minimal required adequate used dosage ( \textgreater or = 20 mg fluoxetine equivalent), only 26 \% of the patients used AD as recommended by international guidelines. Despite continuous use of AD, 60.4 \% relapsed in 2 years. This relapse rate was comparable to the rate of the intermittent users (63.6 \% ). In patients who stopped taking AD after remission and who received additional preventive CT, the recurrence rates were significantly lower than in non-AD-using patients treated with usual care (8 vs. 46 \% ). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of recurrently depressed patients treated with AD discontinue maintenance AD therapy in daily primary and secondary clinical practice. AD seems to offer poor protection against relapse in this patient group. Patients who stopped using AD experienced less relapse, especially if they were treated with preventive CT. Alternative maintenance treatments (including preventive cognitive therapy after discontinuation of AD) should be studied in recurrently depressed patients with intermittent good remission, not only in secondary but also in primary care.",2008.0,10.1159/000110056,IVIM4WYH,0,cognitive,62
62,Response Inconsistency of Patient-Reported Symptoms as a Predictor of Discrepancy Between Patient and Clinician-Reported Depression Severity.,"Conijn, Judith M.; Emons, Wilco H. M.; Page, Bethan F.; Sijtsma, Klaas and","The aim of this study was to assess the extent to which discrepancy between self-reported and clinician-rated severity of depression are due to inconsistent self-reports. Response inconsistency threatens the validity of the test score. We used data from a large sample of outpatients (N = 5,959) who completed the self-report Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the clinician-rated Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). We used item response theory based person-fit analysis to quantify the inconsistency of the self-report item scores. Inconsistency was weakly positively related to patient-clinician discrepancy (i.e., higher BDI-II scores relative to MADRS scores). The mediating effect of response inconsistency in the relationship between discrepancy and demographic (e.g., ethnic origin) and clinical variables (e.g., cognitive problems) was negligible. The small direct and mediating effects of response inconsistency suggest that inaccurate patient self-reports are not a major cause of patient-clinician discrepancy in outpatient samples. Future research should investigate the role of clinician biases in explaining clinician-patient discrepancy.",2016.0,10.1177/1073191116666949,7ZWHSGW4,0,cognitive,63

64,Perceived control moderated the self-efficacy-enhancing effects of a chronic illness self-management intervention,"Jerant, A.; Moore, M.; Lorig, K.; Franks, P.","Objective: Identifying moderators of the effects of self-efficacy-enhancing interventions could improve their efficiency. We examined the effects of a home-based variant of the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program on self-efficacy, and explored the moderating effects of perceived control over self-management (PCSM). Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, patients (N= 415) aged \textgreater 40 years with various chronic conditions plus basic activity impairment and/or significant depressive symptoms were randomized to one of three groups: intervention provided in homes or by telephone, v. usual care control. We used mixed effects linear models for repeated measures to examine effects on self-management self-efficacy at 6-month follow-up and explore moderation by PCSM. Results: Only the home intervention had a significant self-efficacy-enhancing effect (Wald test, $\chi$2 = 13.8, p = 0.008; effect size = 0.3). The effect was moderated by PCSM, considered as a continuous [effective in subjects with lower PCSM (Wald test, $\chi$2 = 13.4, p = 0.009)] or categorical (effective only for subjects in the lowest tercile) variable. Conclusions: People with lower PCSM appear more likely to experience enhanced self-efficacy from chronic illness self-management training than those with higher PCSM. These findings, although preliminary, suggest that office-based measurement of PCSM might identify those chronically ill patients likely to benefit most from self-management training. \textcopyright SAGE Publications 2008.",2008.0,,MKHNI92X,0,behavior,65

Setting: The study was implemented in a university clinical research laboratory. However, therapy was predominantly self-administered at-home by subjects. Participants: Two subjects, presented with opposing chronic symptoms after stroke. Both were enrolled several years post-acute had completed a standard prescribed stroke rehabilitation program prior to enrollment. Interventions: Patients completed a 13-month intervention, which consists of three primary components; (1) TLNS, (2) targeted training and (3) physical exercise. For the first six months of the intervention individuals practiced all three components for one hour, twice daily. Followed by a 30-day withdrawal period, and an additional six months of resumed exercise, training, and device use.Main Outcome Measure(s)Improvements were measured using the RBANS, SIS, DIP, and QIDS-SR16. Results: All measures, physical and cognitive, demonstrated substantial improvement from baseline to end of intervention, with clear stimulation-dependent effect. DIP score improved 58 percent within twelve weeks. Depression score decreased by 10 points-a clinically significant improvement-from moderate depression to complete remission of depression by the end of Phase II. SIS Memory and Thinking domain improved 47 percent from baseline. All components of the RBANS improved as well, ranging from 10-42% improvement in the first six months.Conclusion/DiscussionTLNS intervention can be used to recover and improve cognitive functioning, disordered speech, and emotion in individuals with chronic stroke. These findings present a new non-invasive brain stimulation technique with applications in applied rehabilitative neurosciences. Additional research is necessary to understand the potential mechanisms of this phenomenon and optimize efficiency of the intervention.",2017.0,10.1016/j.apmr.2017.08.136,5IJUVEBA,0,additional,66

S.","INTRODUCTION: Head-to-head comparisons of antipsychotics have predominantly included patients with chronic conditions. The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of ziprasidone and olanzapine in patients with recent-onset schizophrenia. METHODS: The study was an 8-week, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, controlled multicenter trial (NCT00145444). Seventy-six patients with schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (diagnosis \textless 5 y), and a maximum lifetime antipsychotic treatment \textless 16 weeks participated in the study. Efficacy of ziprasidone (80-160 mg/d) and olanzapine 10-20 mg was measured using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale, the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS), and the Heinrich Quality of Life Scale (HQLS); tolerability assessments included laboratory assessments, body weight, and electroencephalogram. RESULTS: Olanzapine (n = 34) and ziprasidone (n = 39) showed equal efficacy as measured by the PANSS, CDSS, CGI, and HQLS. However, mean weight gain was significantly higher in the olanzapine group (6.8 vs 0.1 kg, P \textless .001). Ziprasidone was associated with decreasing levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, and transaminases, while these parameters increased in the olanzapine group (all P values \textless .05). There were no significant differences in fasting glucose and prolactin levels or in cardiac or sexual side effects. Patients on ziprasidone used biperiden for extrapyramidal side effects more frequently (P \textless .05). DISCUSSION: The results of this study indicate that ziprasidone and olanzapine have comparable therapeutic efficacy but differ in their side effect profile. However, there is a risk of a type II error with this sample size. Clinically significant weight gain and laboratory abnormalities appear early after initiating treatment and are more prominent with olanzapine, while more patients on ziprasidone received anticholinergic drugs to treat extrapyramidal symptoms.",2011.0,10.1093/schbul/sbp037,EYUV8X79,0,behavior,67

METHOD: A selective review of the literature on adaptive style, and its' relevance to outcomes of depressive symptoms, posttraumatic stress symptoms, somatic distress, and health-related quality of life in children with cancer. RESULTS: Studies have found children with cancer report low levels of psychological distress. Adaptive style is a much stronger predictor of psychosocial outcomes than is health history. CONCLUSION: Children with cancer represent a flourishing population. A repressive adaptive style is one pathway to resilience in this population.

B.","Traditional models of physical dependence suggest that nicotine dependence should be reflected by the extent of drug exposure (e.g., smoking rate) and by evidence of physiological adaptation (e.g., withdrawal severity). An affective model suggests that nicotine dependence should be related to an individual's tendency to experience negative affect and expectations that nicotine use would ameliorate such affect. This research investigated the ability of these 2 models to predict relapse back to smoking at 6 months postquit. Logistic regression models were developed and tested in 505 heavy smokers participating in nicotine patch clinical trials. Results supported both models, but the most potent predictor of outcome was postquit negative affect, which accounted for much of the predictive validity of traditional measures of nicotine dependence.

69,Post-traumatic stress and associated disorders among Vietnam veterans: the significance of combat exposure and social support.,"Boscarino, J. A.","The hypothesis is tested that individuals exposed to traumatic stress who currently have lower social support have higher rates of post-traumatic stress and associated disorders. To test this, the current prevalence of five psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress, generalized anxiety, depression, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse, were studied among a random sample of veterans who served in Vietnam (N = 2,490) and a random sample of era veterans who did not (N = 1,972). Logistic regression was used to analyze each disorder, controlling for past combat exposure, current social status, childhood delinquency, military adjustment, and current social support. Combat exposure was the best predictor of post-traumatic stress and was also associated with anxiety and depression, but not alcohol or drug abuse. Substance abuse was associated with childhood delinquency, and the best predictor of drug abuse was illicit Army drug use. Lower social support was associated with all disorders, except drug abuse. Although the causal nexus is not clear in this case, this study suggests that future research and clinical interventions should not overlook the significance of social support among victims of traumatic stress.",1995.0,,2U9F9ADN,0,diathesis,70

There are no direct randomized comparative studies of different medications. Objectives.‐ Comparative efficacy and safety of sertraline, agomelatine, valproate and sertraline + valproate in depression in BDII. Methods.‐ 89 depressive patients (total score HDRS>=17, CGI score>=3) with BD II diagnosis, 18‐65 years old (average 38+/‐2.5 years), disease duration>=2 years, were randomized into 4 groups: agomelatine (n = 28); sertraline (n = 20); valproate (n = 21); valproate + sertraline (n = 21). Rating scales were assessed at the screening and every week of therapy. The main efficacy measures were the rates of response (50% score reduction in HDRS) and remission (total HDRS score < 7). Results.‐ 72 patients completed the study. The reasons for the premature discontinuation: mood switches to hypomania ‐ 1 (3.6%) for agomelatine, 4 (20%) for sertraline, 1 (5%) ‐ suicide attempt in the combination therapy group, adverse events ‐ 1 (3.6%) for agomelatine, 3 (14.3%) for valproate, 4 (20%) for combination, lack of efficacy ‐ 3 (10.7%) for agomelatine. At the end of the study the number of responders was: sertraline ‐ 65%, agomelatine ‐ 42.9%, valproate ‐ 57.1%, combination ‐ 60% (N/S); number of remitters: combination ‐ 45%, valproate ‐ 33.3%, agomelatine ‐ 32.1%, sertraline ‐ 20% (N/S). The differences in adverse events frequency between groups were N/S. Conclusions.‐ Efficacy and tolerability were comparable in all therapeutic groups with some advantage of valproate + sertraline combination, providing the lowest level of mood switches.",2018.0,10.1016/j.eurpsy.2017.12.016,QDDMGMVK,0,additional,71

C.; Wong, S.; Young, W.; Au, M.","Objective: This study was conducted to identify risk factors for depressive symptomatology among older Chinese migrants. Method: One hundred and sixty-two Chinese migrants aged 55 years or older, living in the community and recruited via Chinese community organizations and general practitioners, were interviewed using a Chinese version of the Geriatric Depression Scale and measures of stressful life events, morbid conditions, self-rated health, acculturation, social support and service utilization. Result: Twenty-six percent of participants met the criteria for depressive symptomatology. No recent migrants showed symptoms of depression. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that lower emotional support, greater number of visits to a doctor, difficulties in accessing health services and low New Zealand cultural orientation increased the risk of showing symptoms of depression. Conclusion: Significant numbers of older Chinese migrants appear to be depressed or at risk for depression and, while participants with depressive symptoms consulted general practitioners more than their counterparts without such symptoms, they reported greater difficulty in accessing health services. The findings point to the need for further epidemiological study of this growing sector of the population and investigation of the nature of its engagement with health services. Social support and aspects of acculturation may play a significant role in preventing depression.

(Achievements and defenses of the spiritual position, and the heart's content).","Maizels, Neil","Explores some conceptual and technical issues in relation to the Kleinian terms Depressive Position and the Working-Through of the Depressive Position, and in so doing, suggests a new concept- the Spiritual Position. It is proposed that this spiritual position has achievements, such as a capacity for meta feeling, 1, and defenses, which are somewhat different, although related to the mourning and reparation of the working-through of the depressive position. Particular attention is paid to the development of the whole-object Father in the formation of an observing-ego-in-feeling, and to the development of the whole-object Mother (Nature) in the formation of a metamorphosic, feeling, philosophy of Life. Together, these formations give the mind a heart, which may come under attack from an omniscient, Tiresias-like internal object. Some clinical material is used to illustrate these achievements and defenses, and to highlight the difference of emphasis (as compared with the working-through of the depressive position) that they imply.

73,Treatment consideration for comorbid mood disorders in schizophrenic patients,"Tollefson, G. D.","The anatomy of the pharynx of Caenorhabditis elegans has been reconstructed from electron micrographs of serial sections. The pharynx is used for pumping food into the gut, and is composed of 34 muscle cells, 9 marginal cells, 9 epithelial cells, 5 gland cells and 20 neurones. Three regions of specialization in the cuticle lining of the pharyngeal lumen may aid in the accumulation of food particles. A basement membrane isolates the pharynx from the rest of the animal, making the pharyngeal nervous system a nearly self-contained unit which is composed primarily of five classes of motor neurones and six classes of interneurones. Three other classes have also been described, which by their morphology appear to be neurosecretory and motor, motor and interneuronal, and lastly one pair that only innervates three of the marginal cells. Some classes of neurone have free endings just under the cuticle lining the lumen of the pharynx, suggesting that these are mechano- or proprio-receptive endings. The connectivity of these neurones has been described at the level of individual synaptic regions, and after combining this information with video taped observations of the pharynx pumping, some interpretations of how these neurones function have been offered.",1997.0,10.1098/rstb.1976.0085,VL945LXK,0,behavior,74

Therefore, to evaluate the relationship between the quality of AEs and functional impairment, we studied 482 outpatients with depressive disorders who were not receiving any antidepressant treatment prior to the baseline visit and started it thereafter in usual clinical settings. The Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report Japanese version and antidepressant AEs for subjective assessment (antiAS) were performed at baseline and 10 days after antidepressant initiation (i.e. second visit). Functional impairment was evaluated with the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) on the second visit. As a result, the SDS was positively associated with the number of AEs (??=0.089, p=0.022) in multiple linear regression analysis (adjusted R2=0.357, p \textless 0.001). Subjects who experienced vertigo, nausea and insomnia had significantly more functional impairment than those who did not. Additionally, the number of severe AEs (??=0.151, p \textless 0.001) was associated with a higher SDS score, and those AEs with a negative causal attribution to antidepressants in the antiAS significantly affected the SDS (??=0.105, p=0.008).

H.","Objective Using a large prospective cohort of women age 40 or younger diagnosed with breast cancer, we examined the relationship between perceived partner support and anxiety. Methods Six hundred seventy-five young women with breast cancer Stages I-III, median age 36, completed a self-report baseline questionnaire. Perceived partner support was assessed using items extracted from the marital subscale of the Cancer Rehabilitation Evaluation System; generalized social support was assessed with the Medical Outcomes Study-Social Support Survey. Anxiety was measured using the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Multivariable logistic regression analyses evaluated the association between partner support, other sociodemographic factors, and anxiety. Results Mean age at diagnosis was 35.4 years. Fourteen percent of the women were not partnered, and among those who were partnered or in a significant relationship, 20 \% were categorized as unsupported. In univariate and multivariable analysis adjusting for sociodemographic factors, women in an unsupported-partnered relationship had higher odds of anxiety symptoms compared with women in a supported-partnered relationship. Young age and being financially insecure were also both independently associated with anxiety. Conclusions Our findings suggest that partner support may play a key role in a young woman's adjustment to a serious stressor such as breast cancer. In addition, younger age increases vulnerability to anxiety as does struggling with finances. Because supportive efforts of a partner have potential to protect against the impact of stress, interventions to enhance partner support and reduce anxiety might be beneficial to address challenges experienced as a couple in this setting.",2015.0,10.1002/pon.3780,RBKC6SNK,0,diathesis,77

E.; Iaboni, A.","Objective: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) may be the first manifestation of an underlying neurocognitive disorder. We undertook a review to provide an update on the epidemiology and etiological mechanisms of NPS that occur in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and just before the onset of MCI. We discuss common clinical presentations and the implications for diagnosis and care. Method: The authors conducted a selective review of the literature regarding the emergence of NPS in late life, before and after the onset of MCI. We discuss recent publications that explore the epidemiology and etiological mechanisms of NPS in the earliest clinical stages of these disorders. Results: NPS have been reported in 35% to 85% of adults with MCI and also occur in advance of cognitive decline. The occurrence of NPS for the first time in later life should increase suspicion for an underlying neurocognitive disorder. The presenting symptom may provide a clue regarding the etiology of the underlying disorder, and the co-occurrence of NPS may herald a more accelerated cognitive decline. Conclusions: NPS are prevalent in the early clinical stages of neurocognitive disorders and can serve as both useful diagnostic and prognostic indicators. Recognition of NPS as early manifestations of neurocognitive disorders will become increasingly important as we move towards preventative strategies and disease-modifying treatments that may be most effective when deployed in the earliest stages of disease.",2017.0,10.1177/0706743716648296,EG9GGJE7,0,additional,79

M.; Henderson, L. A.","The neural mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of chronic pain following nerve injury remain unclear. There is growing evidence that chronic neuropathic pain is associated with altered thalamic firing patterns, thalamocortical dysrhythmia and altered infra-slow oscillations in ascending pain pathways. Preclinical and post-mortem human studies have revealed that neuropathic pain is associated with prolonged astrocyte activation in the dorsal horn and we have suggested that this may result in altered gliotransmission, which results in altered resting neural rhythm in the ascending pain pathway. Evidence of astrocyte activation above the level of the dorsal horn in living humans is lacking and direct measurement of astrocyte activation in living humans is not possible, however, there is evidence that regional alterations in T2 relaxation times are indicative of astrogliosis. The aim of this study was to use T2 relaxometry to explore regional brain anatomy of the ascending pain pathway in individuals with chronic orofacial neuropathic pain. We found that in individuals with trigeminal neuropathic pain, decreases in T2 relaxation times occurred in the region of the spinal trigeminal nucleus and primary somatosensory cortex, as well as in higher order processing regions such as the dorsolateral prefrontal, cingulate and hippocampal/parahippocampal cortices. We speculate that these regional changes in T2 relaxation times reflect prolonged astrocyte activation, which results in altered brain rhythm and ultimately the constant perception of pain. Blocking prolonged astrocyte activation may be effective in preventing and even reversing the development of chronic pain following neural injury.",2018.0,10.1016/j.nicl.2018.04.015,QBZHTHD3,0,additional,80

Subjects were 154 full-term 12-month-old infants (64 unexposed, 61 with lighter cocaine exposure, 29 with heavier cocaine exposure) and their primary caregivers from low-income, urban backgrounds. Exposure status was determined in the maternity ward by biologic assay (infant meconium and/or maternal or infant urine) and maternal self-report. At the 12-month follow-up visit, infants were videotaped with their primary caregiver in Ainsworth's Strange Situation. Reliable coders masked to exposure status scored videotapes for attachment variables, amount of crying, and level of avoidance. Contrary to popular perceptions, level of prenatal cocaine exposure was not significantly related to secure/insecure attachment status, disorganized attachment status, or rated level of felt security. Foster care status also was not associated with attachment status. However, heavier prenatal cocaine exposure, in interaction with maternal contextual variables (public assistance or multiparity) was associated with alterations in infant socio-affective behavior, including a higher level of behavioral disorganization, more avoidance of the caregiver, and less crying.",2003.0,,BBZN99AY,0,psychodynamic,82

J. J.; Draijer, N.; Apenhorst-Hol, M.; Kupka, R. W.","Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD) both are severe and chronic psychiatric disorders. Both disorders have overlapping symptoms, and current research shows that the presence of a BPD has an adverse effect on the course of BD. The limited research available shows an unfavorable illness course, a worse prognosis and response to medication, longer treatment duration, more frequent psychiatric admissions, higher drop-out, increased risk of substance abuse, increased risk of suicide, and more impairment of social and occupational functioning. However, there is no research available on the effect of specific psychotherapeutic treatment for this patients.Methods/Design: This paper presents the protocol of a RCT to investigate the presence of borderline personality features in patients treated for BD (study part 1) and the effectiveness of STEPPS (Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving) added to treatment as usual (TAU) for BD compared to TAU in patients with BD and comorbid borderline personality features (study part 2). STEPPS is a validated and effective intervention for BPD. The study population consists of patients treated for BD at specialized outpatient clinics for BD in the Netherlands. At first the prevalence of comorbid borderline personality features in outpatients with BD is investigated. Inclusion criteria for study part 2 is defined as having three or more of the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria of BPD, including impulsivity and anger bursts. Primary outcomes will be the frequency and severity of manic and depressive recurrences as well as severity, course and burden of borderline personality features. Secondary outcomes will be quality of life, utilizing mental healthcare and psychopathologic symptoms not primarily related to BD or BPD. Assessment will be at baseline, at the end of the intervention, and at 12 and 18 months follow-up.Discussion: This will be the first randomized controlled trial of a specific intervention in patients with BD and comorbid BPD or borderline personality features. There are no recommendations in the guideline of treatment of bipolar disorders for patients with this complex comorbidity. We expect that a combined treatment aimed at mood disorder and emotion regulation will improve treatment outcomes for these patients. \textcopyright 2014 Riemann et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2014.0,,FSC3ZSCS,0,behavior,83
83,Psychotherapeutic process in psychodynamic psychotherapy for panic disorder and co-morbid depression.,"Goldman, Heather Ann","The specific research question that is explored in the present study focuses on psychotherapy process variables responsible for improvement of depressive symptoms in a group of DSM-IV panic patients who were being treated with a time-limited manualized psychodynamic psychotherapy for panic disorder called Panic-Focused Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (PFPP; Milrod, Busch, Cooper, \& Shapiro I997). A total of 17 patients with a primary DSM-IV diagnosis of panic disorder participated in the study. The Psychotherapy Dynamic Content Scale (PDCS; Busch, Goldman, Milrod, unpublished, available from the first author) was developed to measure psychotherapy process variables. Ratings were made based on 45-minute videotaped psychotherapy sessions of all study participants at three points in time (session \# 4, session \# 12, and session \# 21). Symptom severity was assessed on each participant at baseline, treatment completion, and at six-month post-treatment follow-up, using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS; Hamilton, 1960, 1967), Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS; Shear, et al., 1997), and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS; Sheehan, 1983). Results indicated that significant differences were found in the number of depression themes addressed by depressed patients and their therapists versus non-depressed patients and their therapists only in the early phase of the psychotherapy. Results also indicated that the presence of patient dynamics and therapist interventions that corresponded to depression-specific constructs correlated with the alleviation of depressive symptoms in the early phase of PFPP. It is clear from the results that all participants, whether they suffered from major depression or not, experienced a significant improvement in psychiatric symptoms (both depression and panic) as well as functional impairment after being treated with PFPP. Additionally, these patients were able to hold onto the gains that they made during the course of therapy as measured at 6-month post-treatment follow-up.

84,The Illness Density Index (IDI): A longitudinal measure of treatment efficacy.,"Kelley, Mary E.; Franco, Alexandre R.; Mayberg, Helen S.; Holtzheimer, Paul E.","BACKGROUND: A reliable and meaningful quantitative index of success is paramount in the trial of any new treatment. However, existing methods for defining response and remission for treatments tested for psychiatric disorders are limited in that they often minimize the variance in change over time among individual patients and generally use arbitrarily chosen levels of functioning at specified times during treatment. PURPOSE: To suggest and determine the properties of an alternative measure of treatment success, the Illness Density Index (IDI), that may be more sensitive to fluctuations in symptoms over the course of treatment compared to existing measures. METHODS: We examined data from 64 depressed patients with multiple assessments of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) over 12 weeks of randomized treatment in order to compare and contrast varying numerical definitions of response and remission, including percent change and linear slope over time. RESULTS: Examination of the indices comparing the within-sample rank of individual patients revealed that these indices agree in cases where patients have little or no response as well as clear and sustained response, while they differ in patients who have a slow (or late) response as well as relapse during the treatment course. LIMITATIONS: The measure may not be useful for all types of studies, especially short-term treatment trials. CONCLUSIONS: The IDI is highly correlated with both categorical (e.g., remission) and continuous (e.g., percent change) definitions of treatment success. Furthermore, it differentiates certain trajectories of change that current definitions do not. Thus, the proposed index may be a valuable addition to current measures of efficacy, especially when trying to identify biological substrates of illness or predictors of long-term outcome.",2012.0,10.1177/1740774512450099,WY7KUBSY,0,cognitive,85

This study of 236 preadolescents (M age = 11.3 years; 129 girls, 107 boys) evaluated 2 intrapersonal (cognitive) pathways by which narcissism might contribute to maladjustment. The first was that narcissism combines with salient self-serving gender stereotypes to encourage aggressive and selfish behavior. The second was that narcissism places children who perceive that they are failing to realize their grandiose self at risk for aggression and depression. Although concurrent-correlational, the data support the pathways, illuminate the content and dynamics of narcissistic children's minds, and suggest directions for future investigation.",2012.0,10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01731.x,NUY5SI9M,0,personality,86
86,"Telephone apprehension : A study of individual differences in attitudes to, and usage of the telephone","Fielding, Richard G.","This thesis explored one form of communication apprehension, namely telephone apprehension, defined as ""anxiety or fear associated with the anticipated or actual use of the telephone"". Using a self-report questionnaire, data from UK and Australian student and non-student samples indicated significant sex (male>female), non-significant age, but significant age by sex interactions (older men>older women, younger nsd). Culture and sample differences were significant (UK>Australian>USA; students>non-students). Correlations between apprehension and use were small. Factor analyses suggested that telephone apprehension comprised three independent factors. ""Problematic Communication"" focuses upon apprehension, whilst ""Approach-Avoidance"" involves overall like-dislike and use-avoidance. ""Confidence"" concerns self-perceived competence. This analysis implied that there was no necessary relation between telephone apprehension and use-avoidance. A validity study concluded that a revised self-report questionnaire incorporating distinctions between using, communicating, speaking and listening by telephone was an appropriately specified, valid and reliable measure of telephone apprehension.An investigation of the correlations of telephone apprehension with generalised anxiety, communication apprehension, social desirability and self-esteem showed that these were non-significant, and accounted for only 6.4% of the overall variance in telephone apprehension.It was concluded that differences in telephone apprehension do not result merely from differences in other, more generalised personality or communication variables.A critical review of the concept of telephone apprehension, and of communication apprehension in general, lead to the redefinition of telephone apprehension within an expectancy-value framework, as the summed product of the evaluative components of beliefs about the negative affective outcomes of telephone use, and their associated outcome expectancies. In addition to apprehension, other variables should be incorporated in predictive models of telephone use, such as non-affective outcome expectancies and evaluations, and self-efficacy expectancies. A combined expectancy-value and self-efficacy model was proposed which incorporated telephone apprehension as one of the predictor variables.

87,Risk and protective factors for medically serious suicide attempts: A comparison of hospital-based with population-based samples of young adults,"Donald, M.; Dower, J.; Correa-Velez, I.; Jones, M.","Objective: To investigate risk and protective factors for medically serious suicide attempts among young Australian adults. Method: The study used a case-control design. A clinical sample of 18-24 year olds was recruited via the emergency department of a large public hospital following a suicide attempt (n=95) and was compared to a sample of 18-24 year olds who participated in a population-based survey (n=380). Results: Risk factors for medically serious suicide attempts included early school leaving, parental divorce (males only), distress due to problems with parents (females only), distress due to problems with friends, distress due to the break-up of a romantic relationship, tobacco use, high alcohol use, current depressive symptomatology and a previous diagnosis of depression. Protective factors included social connectedness, problem-solving confidence and locus of control. There was a trend for social connectedness to be more protective among those with high rather than low levels of depressive symptomatology, and among smokers rather than non-smokers. Conclusions: Results are discussed in terms of designing evidence-based suicide prevention activities for young adults. \ \textcopyright \ 2006 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists.",2006.0,,6X3JH8AM,0,behavior,88

89,Characterologic subtypes of the borderline personality disorder. With a note on prognostic factors.,"Stone, M. H.","Borderline personality disorder (BPD), as defined by DSM, is heterogeneous with respect to the array of the personality traits patients may exhibit. Thus, the characterology of BPD admits of many subtypes. From the standpoint of DSM-Axis II, BPD is almost always associated with a complex personality pattern that meets criteria for several other Axis II disorders--which may then be viewed as characterologic subtypes. Usually these will be from the same dramatic cluster to which BPD itself belongs; namely, histrionic, narcissistic, or antisocial. But any of the Axis II disorders may be found in conjunction with BPD, schizoid being the rarest accompaniment. The Kraepelinian temperaments (depressive, manic, irritable, cyclothymic) constitute another set of subtypes. There is prognostic significance to these diagnostic subdivisions. Irritable and antisocial types predict poor outcome. The poorest prognosis results when antisociality is admixed with psychopathy. Obsessive-compulsive traits, especially self-discipline and orderliness, are associated with good outcome. A number of individual personality traits are found with especial frequency in BPD and may be viewed as finer-scale subtypes. Their presence influences the direction in which therapeutic efforts must be directed and also affects long-term outcome. These traits include mercurial, unreasonable, infantile, volatile, demanding, and going-to-extremes. In general, the nature and intensity of all the traits relevant to each BPD patient (especially those that are offensive or socially alienating), and the balance between negative and positive traits, account for much of the variance in ultimate response to treatment and in eventual outcome.",1994.0,,UWYMGPKM,0,personality,90
90,An epidemiological study of the use of ECT in adolescents.,"Walter, G.; Rey, J. M.","OBJECTIVE: There is little knowledge about the use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in adolescents. Given the prevalence and severity of psychiatric disorders in this age group, it is important to determine the frequency, indications, effectiveness, and side effects of ECT. METHOD: Persons younger than 19 years who received ECT between 1990 and 1996 in the Australian state of New South Wales were identified. Detailed information about diagnosis, treatment, and outcome was then obtained. RESULTS: Forty-two patients aged 14 to 18 years underwent a total of 49 courses comprising 450 ECTs (0.93 \ \% \ of all treatments given to all persons). Marked improvement or resolution of symptoms occurred in half of the completed courses. Mood disorders derived most benefit from ECT. Side effects were transient and minor. Prolonged seizures were observed in 0.4 \ \% \ of treatments. Comorbid personality disorder predicted poorer response, and the anesthetic propofol was associated with shorter seizures. CONCLUSIONS: Although ECT is an effective treatment for some mental disorders in adolescents and has few side effects, it is seldom used. Indications, response, and unwanted effects were similar to those observed in adults. The use of propofol may reduce the risk of prolonged seizures.",1997.0,10.1097/00004583-199706000-00018,LEWY3RWF,0,personality,91

However, the availability of CBT is limited by many factors including distance to major treatment centers and expense. This study evaluates a more accessible treatment approach for chronic pediatric pain using an Internet-delivered family CBT intervention. Participants included 48 children, aged 11-17 years, with chronic headache, abdominal, or musculoskeletal pain and associated functional disability, and their parents. Children were randomly assigned to a wait-list control group or an Internet treatment group. Primary treatment outcomes were pain intensity ratings (0-10 NRS) and activity limitations on the Child Activity Limitations Interview, both completed via an online daily diary. In addition to their medical care, the Internet treatment group completed 8 weeks of online modules including relaxation training, cognitive strategies, parent operant techniques, communication strategies, and sleep and activity interventions. Youth randomized to the wait-list control group continued with the current medical care only. Findings demonstrated significantly greater reduction in activity limitations and pain intensity at post-treatment for the Internet treatment group and these effects were maintained at the three-month follow-up. Rate of clinically significant improvement in pain was also greater for the Internet treatment group than for the wait-list control group. There were no significant group differences in parental protectiveness or child depressive symptoms post-treatment. Internet treatment was rated as acceptable by all children and parents. Findings support the efficacy and acceptability of Internet delivery of family CBT for reducing pain and improving function among children and adolescents with chronic pain.

93,Prevention of homicidal behaviour in men with psychiatric disorders,"Sher, L.; Rice, T.","Objectives. Homicide is overwhelmingly committed by men compared to women. Conservative estimates suggest that more than a third of these individuals have a treatable psychiatric disorder. These data present an opportunity to mental health clinicians to assist in the prevention of homicide by improving men's mental health. Methods. We review the current literature on men's mental health with a focus on assessing and reducing homicide risk in men with psychiatric conditions. Results. Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia appear to share a neural endophenotype that is a risk factor for homicide. Dual disorders, or the presence of a substance use disorder with other major mental illness, are a major risk factor for homicide in males. Dual diagnosis disorders, personality disorders and pathological traits and male depression share emotion dysregulation, irritability, and reactive aggression. Promoting physician education, addressing firearm safety, reducing the reluctance of men relative to women to engage in help-seeking behaviour, and using targeted risk interviews which integrate these data are all currently recommended. Conclusions. The main focus in prevention of homicidal behaviour in males with psychiatric disorders should be to identify high risk groups, to provide adequate treatment, and to facilitate compliance with long-term treatment while considering male specific problems and needs.",2015.0,,ML36KTQV,0,personality,94
94,Patient's lung cancer diagnosis as a cue for relatives' smoking cessation: evaluating the constructs of the teachable moment,"McBride, C. M.; Blocklin, M.; Lipkus, I. M.; Klein, W. M. P.; Brandon, T. H.","Background: To understand whether patient-reported experiences with lung cancer may create teachable moments (TM) for their relatives as evidenced by shifts in their risk perceptions, affective response, and self-image and in turn, motivation to quit smoking. Methods: Patients at a comprehensive cancer center (n = 152) completed a survey within 6 months of lung cancer diagnosis to assess their cancer-related symptoms and openness and enumerated relatives who were smokers. Relative smokers (n = 218) then completed a survey assessing their risk perceptions, affective response, and self-image as a smoker related to the patient's diagnosis (TM mechanisms), and their motivation to quit smoking. Cross-sectional mediation and moderation analyses were conducted to explore the links between patient-reported experiences, and relatives' TM mechanisms, and motivation to quit smoking. Results: Relative-reported affect was a significant mediator of the association between patient-reported symptoms and relative smoker's desire to quit. Relatives' self-image was a significant moderator of the association between patient-reported symptoms and relative smoker's desire to quit, such that patients' reported symptoms were associated with relatives' desire to quit only when the relative smoker reported a generally positive self-image as a smoker. No evidence was found for moderated mediation. However, the link between symptoms and negative affect was moderated by perceptions of risk. Conclusion: Whether smokers experience a family member's lung cancer as a TM is influenced by multiple interrelated cognitive and affective factors that warrant further exploration. Clearer understanding of these factors could inform how to re-invigorate and sustain this motivation to promote concrete actions toward smoking cessation.

95,Too close to home: Counter-transference dynamics in the wake of colleague's sexual boundary violation.,"Nicholsen, Shierry Weber","The author explores the repercussions of a colleague's sexual boundary violation in the analyst who is too close to the situation in that the offending analyst is an important person in her professional world and to her patient. She conceptualizes her counter-transference responses as an affective response to the structure of boundary violation, which is understood as an attack on the psychoanalytic frame. The ethical questions arising in the situation, and the author's decisions regarding them, are discussed in this context. As part of her counter-transference response to the situation as a whole, the author also explores the traumatic impact of the violation of her idealization of psychoanalysis and her identity as an analyst. The paper traces the author's working through and highlights the role of psychoanalytic writing in it, beginning with a crucial insight furnished by a text on sexual boundary violations and followed by what Bion calls ' 'public-ation, both in interpretations to her patient and in writing this paper.

96,"The predictive relationship between beliefs, attitudes, intentions and secondary school mathematics learning: a theory of reasoned action approach.","Norwich, B.; Jaeger, M.","This study investigated how attitudes and intentions about learning mathematics might be related to subsequent mathematics learning and achievement using the Ajzen and Fishbein theory of reasoned action. The sample consisted of 142 boys and girls between 12 and 14 years old in a large inner city comprehensive school who were assessed in a follow-up design over a nine-month period. Beliefs about the outcomes of learning, attitudes to learning, perceptions of significant others' prescriptions about learning, intentions to engage in learning behaviours, self and teacher reported learning behaviour and mathematics achievement were assessed at both stages. Regression analysis suggested that while the expectancy-value components of attitude did relate to learning behaviour intentions, perceived prescriptions did not relate to intentions. There was a weak relationship between the two measures of learning behaviour, but with neither measure did intention independently predict future behaviour once prior behaviour was taken into account. The best predictor of subsequent mathematics achievement was prior achievement, though teacher-reported learning behaviour did have an independent relationship with subsequent achievement. The findings are discussed in terms of the assessment of learning behaviours, the relevance of the behaviour intention construct for repeated multiple behaviours and future work on how affective variables might be related to cognitive achievements.",1989.0,,8TS5ABK9,0,cognitive,97
97,"Evaluating the clinical efficacy of a primary care-focused, nurse-led, consultation liaison model for perinatal mental health.","Harvey, Simone T.; Fisher, Lisa J.; Green, Vicki M.","In Australia, perinatal mental illness is common, although poorly identified and treated. Improved perinatal mental health depends on service provision models that reflect a focus on promotion, prevention, and early intervention, while facilitating improved referral pathways between primary health and specialist mental health services. In 2008, a contemporary community-based model of mental health service provision was developed as an alternative to the pre-existing hospital-based service model. The model is delivered primarily by mental health nurses using a consultation liaison framework. It provides for specialist mental health assessment and brief intervention in collaboration with the general practitioner, who remains the primary health provider. It also aims to raise community awareness and build capacity for the management of perinatal disorders in the primary care sector. Evaluation of the clinical effectiveness of the model, and the improvement in access for primary health providers and women, was conducted at 2 years from its implementation. Clinical effectiveness was evaluated by using comparative data from the Edinburgh Depression Scale and Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale, and the results demonstrated clinical efficacy.

F.; Bosmans, Judith E.; Beekman, Aartjan T. F.; Cuijpers, Pim; Kok, Robin N. and","Background: Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of Internet-based interventions for depression in comparison with usual care. However, evidence on the cost-effectiveness of these interventions when delivered in outpatient clinics is lacking. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of an Internet-based problem-solving guided self-help intervention in comparison with enhanced usual care for outpatients on a waiting list for face-to-face treatment for major depression. After the waiting list period, participants from both groups received the same treatment at outpatient clinics. Methods: An economic evaluation was performed alongside a randomized controlled trial with 12 months follow-up. Outcomes were improvement in depressive symptom severity (measured by CES-D), response to treatment and Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs). Statistical uncertainty around cost differences and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated using bootstrapping. Results: Mean societal costs for the intervention group were ???1579 higher than in usual care, but this was not statistically significant (95 \ \% \ CI - 1395 to 4382). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that the maximum probability of the intervention being cost-effective in comparison with usual care was 0.57 at a ceiling ratio of ???15,000/additional point of improvement in CES-D, and 0.25 and 0.30 for an additional response to treatment and an extra QALY respectively, at a ceiling ratio of ???30,000. Sensitivity analysis showed that from a mental healthcare provider perspective the probability of the intervention being cost-effective was 0.68 for a ceiling ratio of 0 ???/additional unit of effect for the CES-D score, response to treatment and QALYs. As the ceiling ratio increased this probability decreased, because the mean costs in the intervention group were lower than the mean costs in the usual care group. Limitations: The patients in the intervention group showed low adherence to the Internet-based treatment. It is possible that greater adherence would have led to larger clinical effects. Conclusions: Offering an Internet-based intervention to depressed outpatients on waiting list for face-to-face treatment was not considered cost-effective in comparison with enhanced usual care from a societal perspective. There was a high probability of the intervention being cost-effective in comparison with enhanced usual care from the perspective of the mental healthcare provider.",2016.0,10.1016/j.jad.2016.04.025,CVY8C2QF,0,behavior,101

METHODS: A group of 109 consecutive MS patients (McDonald's criteria) referred to the Clinic of Neurology, Belgrade, were enrolled in the study. At three time points during the study (baseline, and at 3 and 6 years during the follow-up period), the HRQoL (measured by MSQoL-54), Expanded Disability Status Scale, and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and Fatigue Severity Scale were assessed. RESULTS: During the study period, 93 patients provided both follow-up assessments. Statistically significant deterioration in the HRQoL at each subsequent time point was detected for all scales of the MSQoL-54 except for the pain and change in health scales. A higher level of education was a significant prognostic factor for a better HRQoL on the cognitive function scale throughout the entire period of observation, while marital status (single, including divorced and widowed) and increased age at the onset of MS had significant predictive values of poorer quality-of-life scores on the overall quality-of-life scale at 6-year follow-up. Higher levels of physical disability and depression at baseline were statistically significant prognostic markers for deterioration in HRQoL for the majority of MSQoL-54 scales during the entire follow-up period.

102,Little evidence for links between memory complaints and memory performance in very old age: longitudinal analyses from the Berlin Aging Study.,"Pearman, Ann; Hertzog, Christopher; Gerstorf, Denis","Cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between memory complaint and memory performance were examined in a sample of old-old participants from the Berlin Aging Study (BASE; N = 504, ages 70 to 100, age M = 84.7 at study onset). Participants were measured 4 times over the course of 6 years. Similar to many previous studies, initial cross-sectional memory complaints were predicted by depression and neuroticism, but not memory performance. Subjective age also predicted memory complaint independent of other variables. Latent growth curve models based on age and time in the study revealed that memory complaints did not change in level with age or time, and manifested no reliable random effects (individual differences in change). These models also detected no significant relationship between changes in memory and either initial memory complaint or changes in memory complaint over age or over time. None of the covariates that predicted initial memory complaints were related to changes in memory complaints over time. An autoregressive latent variable model for memory complaints, consistent with a conceptualization of complaints as judgments constructed from beliefs and other influences in the moment, did detect a concurrent effect of memory on memory complaints at the third occasion, controlling on initial complaints. These results suggest that for the oldest-old, changes in memory complaints may not primarily reflect monitoring of actual age-related memory changes, but rather are affected by other variables, including age-based memory stereotypes, neuroticism, depression, and concerns about aging.",2014.0,10.1037/a0037141,38JH849J,0,cognitive_additional,103
103,Emotion regulation and aging.,"Charles, Susan Turk; Carstensen, Laura L. KW  -,*Age Differences,*Aging,*Cognitive Processes,*Emotional States,Physiology","This chapter focus our review on normal aging as opposed to disease-related aging, and on the general experience of positive and negative affect as opposed to discrete emotions. We begin with a brief overview of age differences in physiological processes involved in emotional experience. We then describe the scope of the existing literature examining age and affective well-being. Next, we present socioemotional selectivity theory (SST) and strength and vulnerability integration (SAVI), both of which guide our understanding of emotional development in adulthood. SST has received considerable empirical support since it was proposed in the early 1990s. Its core tenets concern the ways that time horizons influence goals. SST initially addressed emotion somewhat indirectly, based on the premise that as people become increasingly focused (selectivity) on emotionally meaningful goals, well-being likely benefits. As evidence for social selection accrued along with evidence that emotional well-being is relatively high in later life, we began to consider selection as a highly effective form of antecedent emotion regulation. SAVI, in contrast, was proposed relatively recently. It aims to integrate the relatively positive profile of emotional well-being with concurrent evidence of repercussions for older adults who experience sustained and inescapable exposure to toxic situations. We review empirical findings that are consistent with the premise that motivational shifts lead to differences in attention, memory, social partner preferences, and problem-solving strategies that serve to maintain or optimize emotional experience. Next, we discuss situations posited by SAVI, in which benefits of age may be less pronounced and may even reverse in direction. We then review areas that we previously highlighted as especially important and how they have been addressed since the previous edition of this volume. We conclude that the emerging literature suggests that age differences in emotional experience, cognitive processes, and physiological functioning operate in concert to yield relatively well preserved if not enhanced emotional well being in later life.

104,Does effective management of sleep disorders reduce depressive symptoms and the risk of depression?,"Riemann, Dieter","The link between co-morbid insomnia and depression has been demonstrated in numerous groups. Insomnia has been associated with: (1) an increased risk of developing subsequent depression; (2) an increased duration of established depression; and (3) relapse following treatment for depression. In addition, specific insomnia symptoms, such as nocturnal awakening with difficulty resuming sleep, are more strongly associated with depression than classic symptoms of insomnia. Participants of a workshop, held at the 6th annual meeting of The International Sleep Disorders Forum: The Art of Good Sleep in 2008, evaluated whether the effective management of sleep disorders could reduce both concurrent depressive symptoms and the risk of developing subsequent depression. Following the workshop, a targeted literature review was conducted. Initial evidence demonstrated that in patients with insomnia and co-morbid depression either pharmacological treatment of insomnia or psychological treatment in the form of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia improved both insomnia and depressive symptoms. Although these appeared to be promising treatment strategies, however, of the 27 identified treatment studies, only one large well-designed randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of eszopiclone plus fluoxetine with placebo plus fluoxetine demonstrated unequivocal evidence that improvements in insomnia symptoms conferred additive benefits on depressive outcomes. In addition, it was unclear whether any differences exist in efficacy between sedating versus non-sedating pharmacotherapies for insomnia in this patient group. Further studies of sufficient sample size and duration are needed to evaluate combinations of pharmacological (either sedating or non-sedating) and psychological interventions in co-morbid insomnia and depression. This article reviews the level of evidence, recommendations and areas of particular interest for further study and discussion arising from this workshop.",2009.0,10.2165/11531130-000000000-00000,2LD2VYGT,0,cognitive,105

For example, there is evidence to suggest that variation in the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) predicts response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Environmental factors such as the occurrence of stressful life events before treatment may also be important. One prior report suggests that both factors interact in predicting response to antidepressants. GENDEP, a prospective part-randomized pharmacogenomics trial, collected longitudinal data on the outcome of 811 patients with major depression undergoing treatment with either an SSRI (escitalopram) or a tricyclic antidepressant (nortriptyline). Life events experienced over 6 months preceding treatment were measured using a List of Threatening Experiences Questionnaire, and several polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) have been genotyped including the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR). Stressful life events were shown to predict a significantly better response to escitalopram but had no effect on response to nortriptyline. Variation in the 5-HTTLPR and another polymorphism in the gene, STin4, significantly modified these effects. Gene-environment interactions including life events may therefore be important not only in the aetiology of depression, but also in predicting response to antidepressant medication. \textcopyright 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

106,Emotional eating in adolescents: A gene (SLC6A4/5-HTT) - Depressive feelings interaction analysis,"van Strien, T.; van der Zwaluw, C. S.; Engels, R. C. M. E.","Eating in response to distress - i.e. emotional eating - is highly prevalent in (female) adults with binge eating, but has only a very low prevalence in young children. The present study addresses the emergence of emotional eating in adolescence in relation to depressive feelings. Because a reduction of food intake is considered the biologically natural response to distress, we tested whether the a-typical stress-response of emotional eating develops in interaction with genetic vulnerability. We hypothesized that the short allele of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene, which is associated with lower serotonin activity, would moderate the relation between depressive feelings and the increase in emotional eating, particularly in females. A sample of Dutch families with two adolescents was included in a longitudinal study with a four-year follow-up. A moderator effect of 5-HTTLPR genotype on the relation between depressive feelings and the increase in emotional eating was found in both sexes in the youngest siblings (n = 286). In the older siblings (n = 298), this specific moderator effect was only found in the girls. Younger adolescents and older adolescent girls showed a higher increase in emotional eating if they carried the 5-HTTLPR short allele. This is the first study that found support for a gene × depressive feelings interaction on emergence of emotional eating in (female) adolescents. \textcopyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2010.0,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2010.03.012,TNH6FY73,0,diathesis,107

The aims of the present study were to establish a Japanese version of the Anosognosia Questionnaire-Dementia (AQ-D) and to examine its factor structure, reliability and validity, and to identify the effects of various variables on the AQ-D. Factor structure, internal consistency, test-retest reliability and concurrent validity of the Japanese version of the AQ-D were analyzed. Multiple regression was then done using the results of the AQ-D as dependent variables and entering all relevant predictor variables. Both the internal consistency and the test-retest reliability of the AQ-D were excellent. Factor analysis indicated four factors: anosognosia of basic and instrumental activities of daily living; that of episodic memory and orientation; that of disinhibited behaviors; and that of apathy and depression. The first two factors were regarded as anosognosia of cognitive deficits and were associated with Mini-Mental State Examination scores, while the latter two factors were regarded as anosognosia of behavioral symptoms and were associated with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) score. A dissociation between the two domains of anosognosia was confirmed, namely of cognitive deficits and of behavioral symptoms using the Japanese version of the AQ-D. The knowledge that various factors may have different effects on different domains of anosognosia in patients with AD may serve as useful information for clinicians assessing anosognosia in AD.",2007.0,10.1111/j.1440-1819.2007.01734.x,DI2IVVWQ,0,cognitive,108
108,Nested positive feedback loops in the maintenance of major depression: An integration and extension of previous models,"Smith, R.; Alkozei, A.; Killgore, W. D. S.; Lane, R. D.","Several theories of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) have previously been proposed, focusing largely on either a psychological (i.e., cognitive/affective), biological, or neural/computational level of description. These theories appeal to somewhat distinct bodies of work that have each highlighted separate factors as being of considerable potential importance to the maintenance of MDD. Such factors include a range of cognitive/attentional information-processing biases, a range of structural and functional brain abnormalities, and also dysregulation within the autonomic, endocrine, and immune systems. However, to date there have been limited efforts to integrate these complimentary perspectives into a single multi-level framework. Here we review previous work in each of these MDD research domains and illustrate how they can be synthesized into a more comprehensive model of how a depressive episode is maintained. In particular, we emphasize how plausible (but insufficiently studied) interactions between the various MDD-related factors listed above can lead to a series of nested positive feedback loops, which are each capable of maintaining an individual in a depressive episode. We also describe how these different feedback loops could be active to different degrees in different individual cases, potentially accounting for heterogeneity in both depressive symptoms and treatment response. We conclude by discussing how this integrative model might extend understanding of current treatment mechanisms, and also potentially guide the search for markers to inform treatment selection in individual cases.",2018.0,10.1016/j.bbi.2017.09.011,2IDR4XJ7,0,additional,109

111,The search for knowledge: Developing the American Psychiatric Association's practice guideline for major depressive disorder.,"Gelenberg, Alan J.","Working in Boston in the late 1980s, I received a telephone call from Byram Karasu, M.D. Byram was to chair the workgroup writing the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) first Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and honored me with an invitation to join. The first MDD Guideline was published in 1993. Byram chaired the workgroup that prepared the second edition, which was published in 2000. Since the second MDD Guideline was published in 2000, several additional biological treatments have received the FDA's imprimatur for MDD. Medications include escitalopram, duloxetine, the fluoxetine-olanzapine combination, the selegiline transdermal patch, desvenlafaxine, and the first medication to be approved for adjunctive treatment of resistant depression, aripiprazole. None is viewed as a blockbuster breakthrough. Rather, each offers incremental benefits and expands therapeutic options. There are effective biological interventions beyond medicines. Electroconvulsive therapy has been a mainstay in depression treatment since 1938. Evidence for its efficacy has grown even stronger since the last guideline. So-called complementary and alternative treatments often are used for patients suffering from MDD. Among psychotherapies, cognitive behavioral therapy is the best studied for MDD, and its efficacy is well established.

A sample of 73 high school students (34 boys, 39 girls) completed measures of self-oriented perfectionism, socially prescribed perfectionism, Type A behavior, self-efficacy, depressive symptoms, and psychosomatic symptoms. Correlational analyses found that self-oriented perfectionism was marginally related to Type A behavior. Students with elevated levels of depressive symptoms were also characterized by self-oriented perfectionism, Type A behavior, low self-efficacy, and health symptoms. In addition, health symptoms were linked with low self-efficacy. Simultaneous entry of several variables into a regression analysis found that significant unique predictors of depression were low self-efficacy and elevated self-oriented perfectionism. Similarly, a regression analysis found that low self-efficacy and high self-oriented perfectionism were unique predictors of health symptoms. The findings highlight the distinctions between the perfectionism and the Type A constructs, and support self-regulation models of depression and physical symptoms that include an emphasis on excessive perfectionistic standards and low self-efficacy. We discuss the need for preventive interventions designed for perfectionistic adolescents with low self-efficacy.

Using targeted advertising, we enrolled 153 gamblers (55 \ \% \ female; 32 \ \% \ minority; Mean age=47; SD=18.2) in a clinical validation study of the newly developed computerized gambling assessment module (C-GAM). For these analyses, we classified gamblers into three groups based on their endorsement of DSM-IV PGD: Non-gamblers (0 criteria; n=64; 44 \ \% \ ); PG (1-4 criteria; n=60; 41 \ \% \ ); and PGD (5-10 criteria; n=22; 15 \ \% \ ). We evaluated PG and PGD risk associated with personality disorder pathology using the computerized structured clinical interview of DSM-IV Axis II (SCID-II). Using multinomial logistic regression, we found increased odds of PGD among individuals with greater symptoms of borderline personality disorder after adjusting for socio-demographics, substance abuse/dependence and other personality disorders significant at the bivariate level. Yet after adjusting for depressive symptoms, borderline personality disorder criteria were nonsignificant, suggesting a complex relationship between personality pathology, depression, and gambling. These findings bolster the position that further investigation is needed regarding the association of gambling pathology with personality disorders and depressive symptoms.",2008.0,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2007.11.007,HEA9USNJ,0,personality,116

Several factors influence the concealment of sexual abuse among adolescent girls, which includes cultural factors and social status of the perpetrators. This paper espouses the concept of sexual abuse among adolescent girls, the existence of the problem, its magnitude, the factors that increase vulnerability to violence and abuse, and how these factors intersect with HIV and AIDS. Two case studies using a discovery method were used to explore the phenomenon under the study. The findings of the study indicated that sexual abuse and violence have profound mental health consequences including guilt, anxiety, depression and anger. Future research is suggested to explore this problem on a wider scale and develop interventions that can assist victims and perpetrators to cope with the situation.",2009.0,10/bm8ffg,IEBC4S4K,0,psychodynamic,117

Whether there is a relation between the number of sessions and the efficacy of the treatment is uncertain. METHOD: Randomized clinical trial comparing two treatment conditions in outpatients with major depression. All patients studied had a baseline score of at least 14 points on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The two conditions consist of 8-session or 16-session Short Psychodynamic Supportive Psychotherapy, both in combination with pharmacotherapy. Efficacy was assessed using the 17-item HDRS, the CGI of Severity and of Improvement, the depression subscale of the SCL-90 and the Quality of Life Depression Scale. RESULTS: The rate of change would seem to indicate that eight sessions are preferable for both moderately and severely depressed patients, although the results converged again at the end. Furthermore, in terms of satisfaction with the number of sessions and drop-out percentages during treatment, no differences were found between the conditions. CONCLUSION: In the light of the outcome analysis (faster remission after fewer sessions), a short version of the psychotherapy treatment in a combined course of treatment seems to be justified.",2005.0,10/bnhx4z,6RTPL8VN,0,psychodynamic,118

Final level of depression was significantly and independently predicted (a) by initial level of depression and (b) by the number of global negative trait adjectives women used to describe themselves at initial assessment. For a given level of depression, women with much globally self-devaluative thinking recovered more slowly than equally depressed women showing less of such thinking.

Using data from The Comparative Study of the Prevention of Crime and Violence by Mentally Ill Persons, we examined 128 men with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder discharged from general and forensic psychiatric hospitals in Canada, Finland, Germany, and Sweden. The association between symptoms and aggressive behavior was studied during two 6 month periods when the patients lived in the community. Severe positive and negative symptoms of psychosis, depression, and anxiety were measured at the beginning of each of the 6 month periods. In addition, at the beginning of the second 6 month period changes in symptoms in the previous period were indexed. Aggressive behavior was measured in each 6 month period by reports from patients and from collaterals. During the first 6 months post-discharge, after controlling for the presence of antisocial personality disorder or PCL score and past diagnoses of alcohol/drug abuse/dependence, the presence of a severe positive symptom significantly increased the risk of aggressive behavior. During the second 6 month period, after controlling for antisocial personality disorder or PCL score and self-reported alcohol/drug use, the presence of a severe positive symptom, a TCO symptom, and an increase in TCO symptoms significantly increased the risk of aggressive behavior. Neither depot medications nor obligatory community treatment reduced the risk of aggressive behavior after controlling for the presence of a severe positive symptom and/or TCO symptoms. These findings suggest that, among men with schizophrenia being treated in the community, the presence of severe psychotic symptoms and the development of TCO symptoms are antecedents of aggressive behavior.",2003.0,10.1002/bsl.540,BJY5LCV3,0,personality,122

While both the validity and reliability of the Type D scale (DS14) have been confirmed in Western Europe, less attention has been paid to the subject in other nations. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the validity of the Hebrew version of the DS14 among a sample of cardiac patients in Israel. METHOD: Male patients (N = 94) hospitalized for a first acute coronary syndrome (ACS) completed the DS14 1 month after their ACS. The Brief Symptoms Inventory (BSI) scales for depression and anxiety and the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory-Dutch for measuring covert and overt aggressions were administered during the initial hospitalization (baseline). The BSI was administered again at the 6-month follow-up. At follow-up, patients were also asked about their participation in a formal cardiac rehabilitation program. RESULTS: The two-factor structure of the DS14 was confirmed and the DS14 subscales were internally consistent (Cronbach's alpha = 0.79/0.80). Type D cardiac patients had a significantly higher mean score on anxiety, depression, and covert aggression at baseline compared to non-Type D patients. At the 6-month follow-up, Type D was associated with more anxiety, more depression, and less attendance at a formal cardiac rehabilitation program. The prevalence of Type D in the current sample (5.3 \ \% \ ) was found to be significantly lower than elsewhere in Europe.

Patients and Methods: Epidemiological multicentre cohort study, including 15 gynaecologists and general practitioners representatively distributed in Germany. Data from 125 breast cancer patients in UICC stages IIa to IIIb were selected for the study. A total of 53 of these patients were treated with i.v. vitamin C (supplied as Pascorbin \textregistered 75 g) additional to standard tumour therapy for at least 4 weeks (study group) and 72 without this additional therapy (control group). Main outcome measures were efficacy in regard to outcome and severity of disease- or therapy-induced complaints during adjuvant chemo- and radiotherapy and aftercare. Results: Comparison of control and study groups revealed that i.v. vitamin C administration resulted in a significant reduction of complaints induced by the disease and chemo-/radiotherapy, in particular of nausea, loss of appetite, fatigue, depression, sleep disorders, dizziness and haemorrhagic diathesis. After adjustment for age and baseline conditions (intensity score before adjuvant therapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy), the overall intensity score of symptoms during adjuvant therapy and aftercare was nearly twice as high in the control group compared to the study group. No side-effects of the i.v. vitamin C administration were documented. Discussion: Oxidative stress and vitamin C deficiency play an important role in the etiology of adverse effects of guideline-based adjuvant chemo-/radiotherapy. Restoring antioxidative capacity by complementary i.v. vitamin C administration helps to prevent or reduce disease-, or therapy-induced complaints in breast cancer patients.

So far, only a few prospective studies have investigated the effect of adaptive salutogenic mechanisms on CRF. The aim of our study was to evaluate the possible prospective influence of autonomic Regulation (aR) and self-regulation (SR) on CRF and distress in long-term survivors. METHODS: 95 BC and 80 healthy female controls (C) had been included in the observational study between 2000 and 2001 and completed the questionnaires on aR, SR and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Of these, 62 BC, and 58 C participated in the re-evaluation 6.6 years later: 16 participants were deceased (14 BC and 2 C). During follow-up, participants were requested to answer questions involving (Cancer Fatigue Scales) CFS-D, aR, SR and HADS. Multiple regression analysis was used to evaluate the influence of aR, SR, age, Charlson co-morbidity-index and diagnosis on CFS-D and HADS, and to select further potentially relevant factors. RESULTS: High aR values showed significant effects, namely inverse relationships with CFS-D, cognitive fatigue, anxiety and depression. SR showed a reduced influence on anxiety and depression (all p \textless 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Autonomic regulation might have an independent, reductive influence on global fatigue, cognitive fatigue and--together with self-regulation--it seems to have a protective influence on anxiety and depression. The connection between these parameters is still unclear and awaits further evaluation.

Methods: We carried out a literature search on PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library up to October 2015. We calculated the pooled relative risk of relapse rate and standard mean difference (SMD) of mean change (data at a follow-up time-point – baseline) of the Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Hopelessness Scale, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and Mania Rating Scale scores with their 95 \% confidence interval (95 \% CI). Subgroup analyses based on follow-up time were performed. Results: Nine randomized controlled trials with 520 bipolar I or II disorder patients were reanalyzed. Overall analysis showed that CBT did not significantly reduce the relapse rate of BD or improve the level of depression. However, significant efficacy of CBT in improving severity of mania was proved based on the YMRS (SMD = −0.54, 95 \% CI, −1.03 to −0.06, P = 0.03) but not based on MRS. Subgroup analyses showed that CBT had short-term efficacy in reducing relapse rate of BD (at 6 months' follow-up: relative risk = 0.49, 95 \% CI: 0.29–0.81, P = 0.006) and improving severity of mania based on YMRS score (post-treatment: SMD = −0.30, 95 \% CI, −0.59 to −0.01, P = 0.04).

T. Beck's (1967, 1976) cognitive theory of depression, or attributional biases, as predicted by the reformulated learned helplessness theory (L. Y. Abramson et al; see record 1979-00305-001). Results from the clinical reassessment of 15 depressed female psychiatric inpatients (aged 27-63 yrs) who had participated in a previous investigation by the 3rd and 1st authors indicate that biased attributions did not relate either to the course of the depressive disorder or to symptom severity at the 6-mo follow-up. However, consistent with Beck's cognitive theory, dysfunctional attitudes after recent clinical remission correlated with subsequent symptom severity. Results suggest that persistent dysfunctional attitudes during recent clinical remission may predict subsequent vulnerability to depressive symptoms and that these attitudes may be a more sensitive indicator of persistent depressive psychopathology than the classical signs and symptoms of a depressive episode.

129,Effects of group prenatal care on psychosocial risk in pregnancy: results from a randomised controlled trial.,"Jr, Ickovics; E, Reed; U, Magriples; C, Westdahl; S, Schindler Rising; Ts, Kershaw","Few interventions have succeeded in reducing psychosocial risk among pregnant women. The objective of this study was to determine whether an integrated group prenatal care intervention already shown to improve perinatal and sexual risk outcomes can also improve psychosocial outcomes compared to standard individual care. This randomised controlled trial included pregnant women ages 14-25 from two public hospitals (N = 1047) who were randomly assigned to standard individual care, group prenatal care or integrated group prenatal care intervention (CenteringPregnancy Plus, CP+). Timing and content of visits followed obstetrical guidelines, from 18-week gestation through birth. Each 2-h group prenatal care session included physical assessment, education/skills building and support via facilitated discussion. Using intention-to-treat models, there were no significant differences in psychosocial function; yet, women in the top tertile of psychosocial stress at study entry did benefit from integrated group care. High-stress women randomly assigned to CP+ reported significantly increased self-esteem, decreased stress and social conflict in the third trimester of pregnancy; social conflict and depression were significantly lower 1-year postpartum (all p-values < 0.02). CP+ improved psychosocial outcomes for high-stress women. This 'bundled' intervention has promise for improving psychosocial outcomes, especially for young pregnant women who are traditionally more vulnerable and underserved.",2011.0,10.1080/08870446.2011.531577,9DVFKQY2,0,diathesis,130
130,Attribution and the double bind in paradoxical interventions.,"Hills, Hope I.; Gruszkos, John R.; Strong, Stanley R.","Tested the hypothesis that clear identification of an internal, nonvolitional agent of therapeutic change would enhance therapeutic change and the maintenance of change in response to paradoxical interventions (PIs) and explored the double-bind explanation of PIs. 29 depressed (as determined by the Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]) college students were assigned to 1 of 3 interview treatments containing PIs: A no-elaboration condition contained only PIs; a developmental-meaning condition contained an additional paragraph explicitly identifying a developmental agent of change; and a metacommunication condition contained an additional paragraph explicitly identifying the paradoxical nature and intent of the treatment. At follow-up, Ss completed a battery that included the BDI, a self-perception inventory, and the Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory. Results indicate that PIs that explicitly identified an internal, nonvolitional cause of change resulted in decreased external attribution of change but not greater therapeutic change. Explaining the double-bind aspects of PIs resulted in favorable client views of therapists but diminished the immediate therapeutic effects of the interventions. Results suggest that clients' perceptions of the qualities of their therapists and clients' attributions about the causes of their behaviors may not be causes of therapeutic change but simply additional dependent variables in the therapeutic process.

Therefore, the main purpose was to evaluate the post-discharge functional status of patients who experience delirium after undergoing orthopaedic surgery and the interrelationship of postoperative delirium with underlying cognitive impairment. METHOD: This prospective cohort study, conducted at a tertiary care medical center from April 2011 to March 2012, enrolled all subjects aged over 60 years who were admitted for orthopaedic surgery. The baseline characteristics (age, gender, BMI, and living arrangement), surgery-related factors (ASA class, admission type, type of surgery, and length of hospital stay), results of geriatric assessment (postoperative delirium, cognition, depressive mood, comorbidity, pain, malnutrition, polypharmacy, ADL, and instrumental [I]ADL) and 1-12-month postoperative ADL and IADL functional status were collected for analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 9.1 \% of 232 patients (mean age: 74.7 +/- 7.8 years) experienced postoperative delirium, which was significantly associated with IADL decline at only 6 and 12 months postoperatively (RR: 6.22, 95 \% CI: 1.08-35.70 and RR: 12.54, 95 \% CI: 1.88-83.71, respectively). Delirium superimposed on cognitive impairment was a significant predictor for poor functional status at 6 and 12 months postoperatively (RR: 12.80, 95 \% CI: 1.65-99.40 for ADL at the 6th month, and RR: 7.96, 95 \% CI: 1.35-46.99 at the 12th month; RR: 13.68, 95 \% CI: 1.94-96.55 for IADL at the 6th month, and RR: 30.61, 95 \% CI: 2.94-318.54 at the 12th month, respectively). CONCLUSION: Postoperative delirium is predictive of IADL decline in older patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery, and delirium superimposed on cognitive impairment is an independent risk factor for deterioration of ADL and IADL functional status. Early identification of cognitive function and to prevent delirium are needed to improve functional status following orthopaedic surgery.",2014.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0110339,B5PJP72J,0,cognitive,133
133,Endogenous inhibition of hippocampal LTD and depotentiation by vasoactive intestinal peptide VPAC1 receptors.,"Cunha-Reis, Diana; Aidil-Carvalho, Maria de Fatima; Ribeiro, Joaquim A.","Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), an important modulator of hippocampal synaptic transmission, influences exploration and hippocampal-dependent learning in rodents. Homosynaptic long-term depression (LTD) and depotentiation are two plasticity phenomena implicated in learning of behavior flexibility and spatial novelty detection. In this study, we investigated the influence of endogenous VIP on LTD and depotentiation induced by low-frequency stimulation (1 Hz, 900 pulses) of the hippocampal CA1 area in vitro in juvenile and young adult rats, respectively. LTD and depotentiation were enhanced by the VIP receptor antagonist Ac-Tyr(1) , D-Phe(2) GRF (1-29), and the selective VPAC1 receptor antagonist, PG 97-269, but not the selective VPAC2 receptor antagonist, PG 99-465. This action was mimicked by an anti-VIP antibody, suggesting that VIP, and not pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), is the endogenous mediator of these effects. Selective inhibition of PAC1 receptors with PACAP (6-38) enhanced depotentiation, but not LTD. VPAC1 receptor blockade also revealed LTD in young adult rats, an effect abolished by the GABAA antagonist bicuculline, evidencing an involvement of GABAergic transmission. We conclude that inhibition of LTD and depotentiation by endogenous VIP occurs through VPAC1 receptor-mediated mechanisms and suggest that disinhibition of pyramidal cell dendrites is the most likely physiological mechanism underlying this effect. As such, VPAC1 receptor ligands may be considered promising pharmacological targets for treatment of cognitive dysfunction in diseases involving altered GABAergic circuits and pathological saturation of LTP/LTD like Down's syndrome and temporal lobe epilepsy.",2014.0,10.1002/hipo.22316,NAWXSDKB,0,cognitive,134

Could it be that what he enters into on these occasions is not transference love but an economy of imaginary exchange? In this economy time is the time of the father of the period, and love is the token of appearance, one to be given at the door, whether in the coming or the going. And if love is here such an imaginary dispensation, a dispensation which the father-analyst assumes in his person, is the patient not already spoken for, documented in his status as individual? In this reception names function only as labels of the kind Roudinesco lists: ego-omnipotence, narcissism, loneliness, depression, instability; the so-named patient herself. This is not the place for naming as an appropriation from what might be encountered in and through analytic discourse. Names aplenty are already installed in the good sense of the father-analyst. In other words, there is no place for chance. With nothing to lose the so-called patient looks, he (or she) looks to the main chance which the so-called analyst, by appearing, personifies. He looks to what he can take from what is on offer. What is on offer is the address of the so-called analyst m terms of the medicinal seriousness of his thought.

P.","This study examined whether different components of capability for suicide (i.e., fearlessness about death, pain tolerance, pain insensitivity, preparation for suicide, suicide plan, and courage), as well as painful and provocative events, nonsuicidal self-injury, depressive symptoms, and hopelessness, could distinguish between suicide attempters, suicide ideators, and non-suicidal controls. A total of 930 Chinese adolescents completed questionnaires, and a multinomial logistic regression was conducted to identify factors that could distinguish among the 3 groups. We found that higher levels of pain tolerance, more detailed suicide plans, more positive attitudes towards suicide, as well as more painful and provocative experiences and more severe depressive symptoms were positively associated with increased likelihood of the engagement in both suicide ideation and suicide attempts. Only nonsuicidal self-injury increased the likelihood of falling in the suicide attempt group as compared to the suicide ideation group. Findings of this study emphasize the role of nonsuicidal self-injury in intervening suicidality.",2018.0,10.1080/13811118.2018.1426507,6JRE5MZM,0,additional,136
136,Attachment and parenting as predictors of four-to-six year old children's social cognition.,"Raikes, H. Abigail","Social cognition is an important component of children's social adjustment. Mental models of relationships, specifically representations that arise through the attachment relationship with parents, and parenting quality are hypothesized to be critical components of social cognition. However, little research has addressed how early attachment representations and parenting quality interact to inform the quality of children's social cognition in the preschool and early school years. This dissertation examined longitudinal predictors of the quality of children's social cognition (defined by negative attribution biases, social problem solving, and loneliness), focusing on how the attachment representation developed in the infant and toddler years, quality of parenting in the preschool and early school years, and exposure to maternal depression interact to influence children's social cognition at 4 years and at the end of first grade. Both concurrent parenting and children's attachment security contributed to social cognition at 4 and at the end of first grade. Children's relevant and socially competent solutions to social problems were related to attachment and concurrent maternal depression at 24 and 36 months, while children's negative attributions at 4 years were related to attachment security at 36 months, but were not related to either attachment at 24 months nor to concurrent parenting. Children's feelings of loneliness, assessed in first grade, were related to attachment at 24 and 36 months, and to concurrent maternal sensitivity. Children's negative attributions were related to attachment and concurrent harsh parenting, while children's aggressive responses to social problems were not related to attachment but were related to concurrent maternal sensitivity and depression. The effects of attachment on social cognition varied according to the parenting received in the preschool and early school years; children with insecure attachment histories were more sensitive to the effects of parenting later in life than children with secure attachment histories. Results point to the importance of parent-child relationships for children's social cognition, and demonstrate the complex origins of social cognition in young children.

137,Psychosocial impacts of a camping experience for children with cancer and their siblings,"Wellisch, D. K.; Crater, B.; Wiley, F. M.; Belin, T. R.; Weinstein, K.","Background: We conducted a prospective two-group evaluation of pediatric cancer patients and their siblings regarding experiences and affective changes resulting from a 1-week summer camp experience. Methods: The patients and siblings were assessed prior to camp (Baseline), at the end of camp (Follow-up 1), and again 4-6 months later (Follow-up 2). Assessments included standardized tests for depressive affects, social competency, and a measure of pleasure and participation in camp activities. Results: Sixty-six children were assessed, including 31 (47 \% ) patients and 35 (53 \% ) siblings. Ages ranged from 7 to 17 years. Of the patient campers 19 (61 \% ) had leukemia or lymphoma and 12 (39 \% ) had solid tumors. Results showed marked changes in affective symptoms for patient campers over time (improvements), not shown by sibling campers. For patient campers these affective changes were not present immediately after camp, but were quite significant when measured 4-6 months later. Both patient and sibling campers reflected the same positive memories and pleasure in camp activities over time. For neither group did memories or pleasure fade over time. The camping experience did not have differential impacts on first time versus returning campers. Twelve campers (18 \% of sample) indicated suicidal ideation on the measure of depressive affects. They did well at camp and presented no special management issues. Conclusion: Expectations appear substantially different for patient versus sibling campers. The camping experience appeared to impact these groups differently, with patient campers impacted in ways not experienced by sibling campers.

138,Outcome of cognitive-behavioral therapy for depression: relation to hemispheric dominance for verbal processing.,"Bruder, G. E.; Stewart, J. W.; Mercier, M. A.; Agosti, V.; Leite, P.; Donovan, S.; Quitkin, F. M.",Unmedicated depressed outpatients were tested on dichotic syllable and complex tone tests prior to receiving 16 weekly sessions of cognitive therapy (n = 31) or 6-12 weeks of placebo treatment (n = 45). Cognitive-therapy responders had twice the right-ear (left hemisphere) advantage for syllables when compared with nonresponders but did not differ from nonresponders on the nonverbal task. The larger right-ear advantage in cognitive-therapy responders was due to better right-ear accuracy; they did not differ from nonresponders in left-ear accuracy. No differences in perceptual asymmetry or accuracy were found between placebo responders and nonresponders. Right-ear accuracy for syllables was the best predictor of response to cognitive therapy in a logistic regression analysis. The findings suggest that greater left-hemisphere advantage for verbal processing is associated with more favorable outcome of cognitive therapy for depression.,1997.0,,WFWZ57T5,0,cognitive,139
139,Comorbidity of depression and anxiety in the elderly.,"Lenze, Eric J.","Elderly patients with depression commonly suffer from concurrent symptoms of anxiety or comorbid anxiety disorders. Such comorbidity is associated with a more severe presentation of depressive illness, including greater suicidality. Additionally, most antidepressant treatment studies of elderly individuals with depression have found poorer treatment outcomes in those with comorbid anxiety, for example, delayed or diminished response and increased likelihood of dropout from treatment. In terms of treatment of anxious depression, there is evidence that tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin reuptake inhibitors are not different from each other in terms of efficacy or tolerability. Rather than the specific choice of antidepressant medication, it appears that quality of clinical management has the greatest impact on likelihood of remission in anxious depressed elderly individuals. Co-prescription of benzodiazepines is sometimes warranted for severe anxiety, but increases the risk of cognitive or motor impairment. Psychotherapy, including cognitive-behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy, which are efficacious for late-life depression in general, should also be considered for treatment alone or in combination with appropriate medication. Future research areas are also addressed in this paper.",2003.0,,3NKQWAV4,0,cognitive,140

In the present investigation quality of life and its association with tinnitus-related factors: psychological, psychosomatic and audiological, was studied based on a sample of 122 patients, who attended the hearing clinic for distress due to tinnitus. A stepwise regression analysis was performed with quality of life as a dependent variable. Six of 13 variables included in the model proved to be significant regressors and to explain 65 \% of the variance. The six predictor variables were: impaired concentration, feeling depressed, perceived negative attitudes, hypersensitivity to sounds, average hearing level (best ear) and tinnitus duration (the shorter the duration of tinnitus the more negative impact on quality of life). The three most significant predictors were directly related to perceived psychological distress and explained most of the variance in quality of life in tinnitus patients included in this study. An unexpected finding was that fluctuations in tinnitus, vertigo, headache or perceived social support did not prove to belong to the significant regressors. The results are discussed in view of the construct of quality of life, depressive cognitions and social support in general, as well as in tinnitus-specific life circumstances.",2000.0,,P88RCIXH,0,cognitive,141
141,Auditory and Visual Mismatch Negativity in Psychiatric Disorders: A Review,"Maekawa, T.; Hirano, S.; Onitsuka, T.","Event-related potentials (ERPs) provide an objective index of neurocognitive abnormality or dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders. Auditory mismatch negativity (aMMN), which was discovered in the 1980s, is one unique type of ERP. Several lines of evidence suggest that it reflects auditory preattentive (automatic) information processing and the function of glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Many studies also have suggested that aMMN is a promising biomarker for some psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Prospective studies combining analyses of several biomarkers, including aMMN, in schizophrenia patients from the prodromal period, are underway. Meanwhile, the existence of a visual counterpart of aMMN (vMMN) has been disputed, and a genuine vMMN was only confirmed in the last decade. Thus, there have been a relatively small number of vMMN studies compared with studies of aMMN, and the mechanism underlying vMMN is still unclear. However, it is well known that abnormal auditory and visual sensory information processing is present in psychiatric disorders, and vMMN is an important component of ERPs studied in psychiatric patients. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of recent aMMN and vMMN findings in several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, major depression, Alzheimer's disease, and developmental disorders. In doing so, we highlight their potential use as biomarkers of psychiatric disorders. \textcopyright 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.",2012.0,,UXZZGSPY,0,cognitive_additional,142
142,Processes underlying children's responses to witnessing physical aggression in their families.,"Onyskiw, Judee Esther","According to the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY), 8 \ \% \ of Canadian children aged 4 to 11 years have witnessed physical aggression in their families. This study used structural equation modeling to test the hypotheses that intra-family aggression affects children: (1) because of observational learning/modeling of aggressive behaviour, and (2) because intra-family aggression disrupts mother's ability to provide warm, responsive parenting. The study examined whether there were effects due to the child's age or gender, and if there were differences depending on whether the information was provided from the mother or the child. The sample included 3,014 preschool (4 to 5 years), 5,553 young school-age (6 to 9 years), and 2,654 older school-age (10 to 11 years) children. Mothers provided information for both parent and child variables for all children and 2,174 of the older school-age children self-completed their own questionnaires. Results showed that the theoretical perspectives provide a reasonable explanation for understanding the processes underlying children's adjustment. Children who witnessed aggression more frequently behaved more aggressively themselves. Children were also affected because mothers were less able to provide warm, responsive parenting. Less maternal responsiveness was associated with an increase in both physical and indirect aggression (i.e., manipulative behaviour), internalizing behaviours, and a decrease in prosocial behaviours in children. Depressive symptoms in mothers contributed to children's internalizing behaviours. Children who were more sad, withdrawn, and depressed behaved more aggressively. There were more similarities than differences in children's adjustment in the different age groups. Across all age groups, boys used more physical aggression, less indirect aggression, and were less socially competent than girls. Gender did not influence children's internalizing behaviours. The model explained 25.5 \ \% \ to 33.6 \ \% \ of the variance in physical aggression, 15.1 \ \% \ to 26.9 \ \% \ in indirect aggression, 15.0 \ \% \ to 17.4 \ \% \ in internalizing behaviours, and 12.6 \ \% \ to 18.9 \ \% \ in prosocial behaviours for children in the different age groups. The model had a better fit when the data used were provided by mothers rather than both mothers and children because of the divergence between mothers' and children's reports.

It is increased in industrialized areas with great population concentration such as Monterrey, NL, Mexico. To study this population, advancing and identifying their necessities is imperative. Objectives: To quantify the used medications, to document the established diagnoses and to establish correlations with the geriatric evaluation. Material and methods: Two-hundred-fifty geriatric evaluations were done using the instruments of exam of the mental state (MMSE Folstein), scale of geriatric depression (GDS Yesavage), activities of the daily life (AVD Katz), instrumental activities of the daily life (AIVD Lawton - Brody) and revision of the clinical file. Results: Subjects were 105 men (42 \% ) and 145 women (58 \% ). Age 52-97 years, average: 72 years. Average of diagnoses: 6.7. Medications used in the last week 3; in the last month 2.69. Mean MMSE: 26.3 points, mean GDS: 2.98, mean AVD: 5.8, mean AIVD: 6.2. In the number of taken medications and number of diagnoses related to MMSE data were significant, p -.03 and -.05, respectively. Number of diagnoses related to AVD was significant with a p -.04. Conclusions: Population had a similar age distribution to the national one; the epidemic characteristics reflect that reported in the literature; the number of medication was the expected; the geriatric evaluation is preferably intact, which allows preventive measures; we detected bigger percentage of alterations in GDS regarding other populations.

Premorbid differences in HPA axis function have been found to prospectively predict the onset of adolescent depression. To what extent might our knowledge of HPA axis function in adolescents with, or at risk for, depression, help guide efforts to prevent depression in this age group? We review evidence regarding the role of the HPA axis in the development of adolescent depression, and examine whether and which HPA axis measures might be useful in guiding prevention efforts as (a) as a criterion by which to select youth at risk for depression, (b) as a predictor of which youth will be most responsive to prevention efforts, and (c) as an indicator of whether prevention/intervention efforts are working. We conclude that our current understanding of the HPA axis, and its measurement, in adolescent depression are not sufficiently precise to be of immediate practical use in improving prevention efforts. Incorporating HPA axis measures into prevention studies, however, would be immensely useful in clarifying the role of the HPA axis in adolescent depression, such that future prevention efforts might more confidently rely on HPA axis information.",2008.0,10.1017/S0954579408000461,KENDLB44,0,cognitive,145

Some important contributions to explain issues of mutual interest can be found in the study of affective regulation and the memory system, particularly of implicit memory processes. For example, the recent observations on the dynamic functioning of the neural system underlying the organization of the emotional experience are very useful for explaining some issues of the object-relation theory.

Each subject was evaluated using the following tests: the Bem Sex Role test, the non-verbal scales of the WAIS test for adults, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Experiential-World Inventory, the Image-Marking Method and the Draw-a-Person test; a psychoneurophysiological profile was also evaluated in order to monitor, by means of four neurophysiological variables (muscular tension, galvanic resistance, skin temperature and heart rate), the reactions to specific and aspecific stress. Before treatment, adults with GHD tended to underestimate their body size by an average of 30 \% , with peaks of 47 \% for the head area; furthermore, they showed a low level of self-esteem, a closed attitude towards social relationships, a pessimistic attitude with a tendency towards depression and a strong sense of detachment from the outside world. After 6 months of GH treatment, patients presented an overall improvement in relation to intellectual tasks, accompanied by a lower level of stress during their performance. A clear improvement was also observed in terms of emotional control during specific and aspecific stress, which might contribute a positive effect on their interrelationships. As expected, the treatment was not able to reduce the subjects' highly distorted perception of body image, due to the fact that GH treatment, despite a clear amelioration of lean/fat body mass ratio, did not change their body proportions. The finding that 6 months after stopping GH therapy, the psychological characteristics of patients reverted to those recorded before treatment supports the GH dependence of the effects observed during therapy. In conclusion, our study seems to suggest that adults with GHD, despite adequate replacement therapy (but not with GH), experience psychological difficulties which seem to be positively influenced by GH therapy.",1995.0,,JGQTBFJZ,0,diathesis,149
149,Vascular depression: a new view of late-onset depression.,"Alexopoulos, G. S.; Bruce, M. L.; Silbersweig, D.; Kalayam, B.; Stern, E.","We have suggested that cerebrovascular disease may predispose, precipitate, or perpetuate some late-life depressive syndromes. The mechanisms of vascular depression include disruption of cortico-striato-pallido-thalamo-cortical (CSPTC) pathways or their modulating systems. This view is supported by the presentation of vascular depression, which consists of depressive symptoms, cognitive abnormalities, as well as neuroimaging findings that may result from CSPTC impairment. Moreover, clinical and electrophysiological evidence of CSPTC impairment, an abnormality frequently found in patients with vascular depression, appears to be associated with poor response to antidepressant treatment and early relapse and recurrence. The vascular depression hypothesis provides the conceptual background for studies that may have clinical and theoretical impact. Agents influencing dopamine, acetylcholine, and opioid neurotransmitters may be studied in vascular depression, since these are essential neurotransmitters of the frontostriatal circuitry. Drugs used for prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular disease may be shown to reduce the risk for vascular depression or improve its outcomes. The choice of antidepressants in vascular depression may depend on their effect on neurological recovery from ischemic lesions. Finally, identification of specific relationships between specific symptoms, cognitive deficits, and disability may lead to interventions that target the patients' deficits as well as their interactions with psychosocial factors known to contribute to depression. Research can clarify the pathways to vascular depression by focusing on the site of lesion, the resultant brain dysfunction, the presentation of depression and time of onset, and the contribution of nonbiological factors.",1999.0,,SX3L7478,0,cognitive,150

The shared intention is to reflect cost differences between patients in reimbursement rates. This requires understanding of patient characteristics that influence hospital resource use. The aim of this review was to show which associations between mental health care per diem hospital costs and patient characteristics are supported by current evidence. Methods. A systematic review of the literature published between 1980 and 2012 was carried out. The search strategy included electronic databases and hand-searching. Furthermore, reference lists, citing articles and related publications were screened and experts were contacted. Results. The search found eight studies. Dispersion in per diem costs was moderate, as was the ability to explain it with patient characteristics. Six patient characteristics were identified as the most relevant variables. These were (1) age, (2) major diagnostic group, (3) risk, (4) legal problems, (5) the ability to perform activities of daily living and (6) presence of psychotic or affective symptoms.

151,Acupuncture for depression.,"Smith, Caroline A.; Hay, Phillipa Pj; Macpherson, Hugh","BACKGROUND: There is interest from the community in the use of self help and complementary therapies for depression. This review examined the currently available evidence supporting the use of acupuncture to treat depression. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effectiveness and adverse effects of acupuncture in the treatment for depression. SEARCH STRATEGY: The following databases were searched: CCDAN-CTR, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 to Dec 2008), EMBASE (1980 to Dec 2008), PSYCINFO (1874 to Dec 2008), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), CINAHL (1980 to Dec 2008), Wan Fang database (to Dec 2008). The following terms were used: depression, depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder and acupuncture. SELECTION CRITERIA: Inclusion criteria included all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials comparing acupuncture with sham acupuncture, no treatment, pharmacological treatment, other structured psychotherapies (cognitive behavioural therapy, psychotherapy or counselling), or standard care. The following modes of treatment were included: acupuncture, electro acupuncture or laser acupuncture. The participants included adult men and women with depression defined by clinical state description, or diagnosed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV), Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC), International Classification of Disease (ICD) or the Criteria for Classification and Diagnosis of Mental Diseases CCMD-3-R. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Meta-analyses were performed using relative risk for dichotomous outcomes and standard mean differences for continuous outcomes, with 95 \% confidence intervals. Primary outcomes were reduction in the severity of depression, measured by self rating scales, or by clinician rated scales and an improvement in depression defined as remission versus no remission. MAIN RESULTS: This review is an update and now contains data from 30 studies. Following recent searches, 23 new studies have been added and a further 11 trials were excluded (due to suboptimal doses of medication, no clinical outcomes, insufficient reporting). Thirty trials with 2,812 participants are included in the meta-analysis.There was a high risk of bias in the majority of trials. There was insufficient evidence of a consistent beneficial effect from acupuncture compared with a wait list control or sham acupuncture control. Two trials found acupuncture may have an additive benefit when combined with medication compared with medication alone. A subgroup of participants with depression as a co-morbidity experienced a reduction in depression with manual acupuncture compared with SSRIs (RR 1.66, 95 \% CI 1.03, 2.68) (three trials, 94 participants). The majority of trials compared manual and electro acupuncture with medication and found no effect between groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found insufficient evidence to recommend the use of acupuncture for people with depression. The results are limited by the high risk of bias in the majority of trials meeting inclusion criteria.",2010.0,10.1002/14651858.CD004046.pub3,58NCDI5D,0,cognitive,152
152,Two-year follow-up of behavioral treatment and maintenance for body dysmorphic disorder.,"McKay, Dean","Recent research has suggested that body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is part of the obsessive-compulsive spectrum of disorders. As such, it has been hypothesized that these disorders respond in a similar manner to obsessive-compulsive disorder when behavioral interventions are used. A continuation of follow-up was conducted with a group of patients with BDD following treatment. 10 patients (aged 21-45 yrs) completed an intensive behavioral therapy program and either participated in a 6-mo maintenance program or served as controls. At 12-, 18-, and 24-mo follow-up assessments, patients participating in the maintenance program were more effective at managing limited symptom return and had significantly lower anxiety and depression. Both groups remained improved for acute symptomatology and behavioral avoidance. The results suggest that maintenance programs following behavioral treatment are effective in preventing symptom relapse and assist in patient self-management of lapses typically associated with BDD.

153,Substance abuse and psychiatric co-morbidity as predictors of premature mortality in Swedish drug abusers a prospective longitudinal study 1970 - 2006,"Nyhlen, Anna; Fridell, Mats; Backstrom, Martin; Hesse, Morten; Krantz, Peter; Nyhln, A.; Fridell, Mats; Bckstrm, M.; Hesse, Morten; Krantz, Peter","Background: Few longitudinal cohort studies have focused on the impact of substances abused and psychiatric disorders on premature mortality. The aim of the present study was to identify predictors of increased risk of drug related death and non drug related death in substance abusers of opiates, stimulants, cannabis, sedatives/hypnotics, hallucinogens and alcohol over several decades.Methods: Follow-up study of a consecutive cohort of 561 substance abusers, admitted to a detoxification unit January 1970 to February 1978 in southern Sweden, and followed up in 2006. Demographic and clinical data, substance diagnoses and three groups of psychiatric diagnoses were identified at first admission. Causes of death were coded according to ICD-10 and classified as drug related deaths or non drug related deaths. To identify the incidence of some probable risk factors of drug related premature death, the data were subjected to a competing risks Cox regression analysis.Results: Of 561 patients in the cohort, 11 individuals had either emigrated or could not be located, and 204/561 patients (36.4 \ \% \ ) were deceased by 2006. The cumulative risk of drug related death increased more in the first 15 years and leveled out later on when non drug related causes of death had a similar incidence. In the final model, male gender, regular use of opiates or barbiturates at first admission, and neurosis were associated with an increased risk of drug related premature death, while cannabis use and psychosis were associated with a decreased risk. Neurosis, mainly depression and/or anxiety disorders, predicted drug related premature death while chronic psychosis and personality disorders did not. Chronic alcohol addiction was associated with increased risk of non drug related death.Conclusions: The cohort of drug abusers had an increased risk of premature death to the age of 69. Drug related premature death was predicted by male gender, the use of opiates or barbiturates and depression and anxiety disorders at first admission. The predicted cumulative incidence of drug related death was significantly higher in opiate and barbiturate abusers over the observed period of 37 years, while stimulant abuse did not have any impact. Alcohol contributed to non drug related death. \ \textcopyright \ 2011 Nyhl \ \' e \ n et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2011.0,10.1186/1471-244X-11-122,RBPLJ2WE,0,personality,154
154,Male fertility: Endocrine stress parameters and coping,"Harth, W.; Linse, R.","Introduction: The impact of psychosocial stress on infertility has not yet been entirely understood in andrology. The objective of this study is to compare endocrine stress parameter levels and coping styles in andrological patients with normal and impaired semen characteristics. Besides, the study is to verify, if sperm quality and coping styles differ between subgroups with normozoospermia and high vs. normal stress parameter levels. Patients and Methods: In a prospective study, 14 patients with impaired fertility (oligo-, crypto- and azoospermia) and 34 patients with normozoospermia underwent standardized diagnostic stress testing comprising masturbation for semen analysis, venous blood testing, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Coping with Stress Questionnaire (SVF 120) as well as spermiogram and hormon analyses. Results: As compared to men with normal semen characteristics, men with impaired fertility showed significantly better coping with stress in the SVF 120, yielding higher scores in compensation, relaxation and diversion. Furthermore, among patients with normozoospermia higher values in the stress parameters prolactin, cortisol, FSH and neopterin (an immunological marker) were associated with subfertility, impairment of motility, hypoosmotic swelling test (HOS), penetration capacity and a significantly higher reaction control in the SVF 120. Conclusions: The results indicate a measurable relationship between high stress parameter levels and subfertility in patients with normozoospermia and quite positive coping strategies in men with impaired fertility.",2004.0,10.1159/000078051,KRGGLM88,0,diathesis,155
155,Prevalence and risk factors of depressive symptoms in a Canadian palliative home care population: a cross-sectional study.,"Fisher, Kathryn A.; Seow, Hsien; Brazil, Kevin; Freeman, Shannon; Smith, Trevor Frise; Guthrie, Dawn M.","BACKGROUND: Depression in palliative care patients is important because of its intrinsic burden and association with elevated physical symptoms, reduced immunity and increased mortality risk. Identifying risk factors associated with depression can enable clinicians to more readily diagnose it, which is important since depression is treatable. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine the prevalence of depressive symptoms and risk factors associated with them in a large sample of palliative home care patients. METHODS: The data come from interRAI Palliative Care assessments completed between 2006 and 2012. The sample (n = 5144) consists of adults residing in Ontario (Canada), receiving home care services, classified as palliative, and not experiencing significant cognitive impairment. Logistic regression identified the risk factors associated with depressive symptoms. The dependent variable was the Depression Rating Scale (DRS) and the independent variables were functional indicators from the interRAI assessment and other variables identified in the literature. We examined the results of the complete case and multiple imputation analyses, and found them to be similar. RESULTS: The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 9.8 \% . The risk factors associated with depressive symptoms were (pooled estimates, multiple imputation): low life satisfaction (OR = 3.01 [CI = 2.37-3.82]), severe and moderate sleep disorders (2.56 [2.05-3.19] and 1.56 [1.18-2.06]), health instability (2.12 [1.42-3.18]), caregiver distress 2.01 [1.62-2.51]), daily pain (1.73 [1.35-2.22]), cognitive impairment (1.45 [1.13-1.87]), being female (1.37 [1.11-1.68]), and gastrointestinal symptoms (1.27 [1.03-1.55]). Life satisfaction mediated the effect of prognostic awareness on depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of depressive symptoms in our study was close to the median of 10-20 \% reported in the palliative care literature, suggesting they are present but by no means inevitable in palliative patients. Most of the factors associated with depressive symptoms in our study are amenable to clinical intervention and often targeted in palliative care programs. Designing interventions to address them can be challenging, however, requiring careful attention to patient preferences, the spectrum of comorbid conditions they face, and their social supports. Life satisfaction was one of the strongest factors associated with depressive symptoms in our study, and is likely to be among the most challenging to address.",2014.0,10.1186/1472-684X-13-10,BD46YPXZ,0,cognitive,156
156,Practical psychological management of old age psychosis.,"Aguera-Ortiz, L.; Reneses-Prieto, B.","Late-onset forms of psychosis have been the object of increasing interest in recent years. Despite the fact that there are still many obscure areas, significant advances in the pathophysiology, delimitation of risk factors, clinical presentation, neuropsychology and the pharmacological treatment have been made. Nevertheless, the psychological aspects of both aetiology and treatment of these late forms of psychosis have received much less attention than the rest. In contrast with that, the clinician is confronted with the need to manage patients that are reluctant to take medications and in which the outcome of pharmacological treatments is not always optimal. The elderly psychotic patient should not be excluded from the possibility of receiving any kind of psychological help. He may benefit from adaptations of different psychotherapeutic measures that can include the more classical techniques as psychodynamic oriented and behavioural-cognitive therapies or the newer forms of treatment specially designed for the aged, as reminiscence or psychomotor therapy. In any case, to obtain any result the patient needs to be managed in a way that goes well further the prescription of a neuroleptic drug. In this paper we review some of the most important psychological cues for the understanding of the elderly psychotic patient. Furthermore, we divide the therapeutic relationship over the time in three parts: The initial contact, the central phase and the termination. We offer some keys for the practical management of the patient in each of these phases, with special attention to the adherence to treatment and early identification of treatment-emergent complications like depressive symptoms or hypochondriac concerns.",2003.0,,E3LX7ZUP,0,psychodynamic,157

A.; Dietrichs, E.; Malt, U. F.; Andersson, S.","Background: Synaptic plasticity might play an important role in the pathophysiology and treatment of bipolar disorders. There is, however, a paucity of human evidence supporting this hypothesis, mainly due to a lack of methods for noninvasive assessment of synaptic plasticity. It has recently been demonstrated that plasticity of the visual evoked potential (VEP) induced by repeated visual stimulation might reflect synaptic plasticity. In this study, we examined VEP plasticity in healthy control subjects and patients with bipolar II disorder (BD-II). Methods: Forty healthy control subjects and 26 individuals with a DSM-IV diagnosis of BD-II matched for age and gender participated. The VEPs were evoked by checkerboard reversal stimulation before and after a modulation block of prolonged (10 min) visual stimulation. Results: The modulation block resulted in significant VEP plasticity in healthy control subjects. The VEP plasticity was significantly impaired in patients with BD-II. Explorative analyses indicated a trend toward a less severe impairment in medicated than in unmedicated patients. Conclusions: Visual evoked potential plasticity might represent a reliable and robust assay for studies of synaptic plasticity in vivo in humans. In addition, our findings support the hypothesis of impaired synaptic plasticity in BD-II. Longitudinal studies are needed to fully clarify the effects of medication and mood state on VEP plasticity. \textcopyright 2012 Society of Biological Psychiatry.",2012.0,10.1016/j.biopsych.2011.09.026,TMPENMSX,0,cognitive_additional,158

This study examined correlates of prescription opioid therapy in 214 Veterans with chronic noncancer pain and an SUD history. Participants completed psychosocial questionnaires and participated in a structured mental health diagnostic interview, and medical diagnoses and opioid pharmacy data were abstracted from their Department of Veterans Affairs electronic medical records. Participants were categorized into three groups based on opioid prescriptions in the past 90 d: no opioid therapy (n = 134), short-term ( \textless 90 d) opioid therapy (n = 31), or long-term ( \textgreater /= 90 d) opioid therapy (n = 49). Relative to participants prescribed no or short-term opioid therapy, participants who were prescribed long-term opioid therapy had a greater number of pain diagnoses; reported higher levels of pain severity, interference, and catastrophizing; and endorsed lower chronic pain self-efficacy. In a multivariate model, number of pain diagnoses and pain interference were associated with a greater likelihood of being prescribed long-term opioid therapy after controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics.

160,"Multidimensional organizational attachment: An examination of measurement, withdrawal cognitions linkage, and moderator issues in explaining turnover.","Culpepper, Robert Albright","This dissertation examined three areas pertaining to prediction of turnover using a multidimensional attachment model (Meyer \& Allen, 1991): (a) measurement issues, (b) issues of intervening withdrawal cognitions linkage, and (c) potential moderator relationships affecting the manner in which attachment components combine to affect withdrawal cognitions and turnover. Measurement issues were addressed using confirmatory factor analysis; linkage and moderator tests employed structural equation modeling. Attachment scale revisions based on previous measurement study results provided a significantly better fit to the data than original scales. A four variable measurement model, separating continuance attachment into perception of low alternatives and perceived high sacrifice subdimensions, was supported. A turnover model employing the Mobley withdrawal cognitions sequence (Mobley, Horner, \& Hollingsworth, 1978) as intervening linkage was compared to a model employing a general withdrawal orientation construct. The latter model yielded a significantly better fit to the data, although both models provided a high degree of fit. Low alternatives continuance attachment moderated model links between affective attachment and thoughts of quitting, and thoughts of quitting and intention to search for alternatives. The high sacrifice continuance factor also moderated the thoughts of quitting-intention to search link. Affective attachment yielded by far the strongest direct effects on withdrawal cognitions variables, while high sacrifice and normative attachment had only modest and weak direct effects, respectively. The low alternatives element produced virtually no direct effects in model tests; it functioned purely as a control variable moderating the translation of affect into turnover, consistent with earlier speculations in the literature. Continuance attachment elements were much higher in rural areas and had a much stronger effect on withdrawal cognitions and turnover. Conversely, affective attachment had a much weaker effect on withdrawal cognitions and turnover in rural areas, even though absolute levels of this variable did not differ by location. This study provides the first test of the Meyer and Allen multidimensional attachment model to predict turnover, using the original scales. Previous work has generally not included actual turnover data and has offered only zero-order correlations between attachment types and turnover-related variables.

It is proposed that motives, as enacted and subjectively experienced, result in a unit of ongoing subjective experience called an emergent moment. It is suggested that such moments are represented in at least 6 separate, parallel, basic schematic formats: sensorimotor schemas, perceptions, concepts, scripts, temporal feeling shapes, and protonarrative envelopes. The temporal feeling shape is proposed as a format for representing affects. The protonarrative envelope is proposed as a format for representing the global experience in a narrative-like form. An extended clinical example is discussed of the different schemas-of-being-with-a-depressed-mother that generally form and become clinically important parts of the infant's representational world.

Aim: To test in a randomized controlled trial whether a self‐efficacy and outcome expectation enhancing stroke selfmanagement program improved health outcomes. Methods: Eligible adult survivors recruited from three acute stroke units were randomized to a new 4‐week stroke selfmanagement program (SESSMP) or usual care. The program, underpinned by Bandura's constructs of self‐efficacy and outcome expectation, offered home visits, community group sessions and follow‐up phone calls. Primary outcomes included self‐efficacy and outcome expectation of self‐management. Secondary outcomes included satisfaction with performance of selfmanagement behaviors, health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), depressive symptoms and community reintegration. Differential changes of outcomes from baseline to 8‐weeks follow‐up (one‐month post‐program) between the two groups were evaluated by generalized estimating equations. Results: We recruited 128 participants (mean age 67.46 years, SD 11.95). The SESSMP group in the intention‐to‐treat (ITT) population showed significantly greater improvements in primary and secondary outcomes except depressive symptoms than the control group across time. Analyses of ITT and per‐protocol populations found the changes in scores of all primary and secondary outcomes across time between the two groups comparable. Those receiving all sessions had the greatest and significant increase in self‐efficacy, outcome expectation and HRQoL across time compared to those completing only part of the SESSMP and to the control group. No program‐related adverse effects were reported. Majority receiving the SESSMP found home visits by nurses and videos about stroke volunteers' recovery experiences most helpful.

163,Zeigarnik's Sleepless Nights: How Unfinished Tasks at the End of the Week Impair Employee Sleep on the Weekend Through Rumination,"Syrek, C. J.; Weigelt, O.; Peifer, C.; Antoni, C. H.","It is almost common sense that work stress leads to sleep impairment, but the question of how work-related stressors impair employee sleep remains open. This study focuses on the role of rumination as the underlying mechanism for sleep impairment. Specifically, the authors contribute to recent research differentiating affective rumination from problem-solving pondering and examine the impact of both forms of rumination on the stressor-sleep relationship. Following theories of rumination and the Zeigarnik effect, they focus on unfinished tasks as a key onset for rumination. Unfinished tasks have received much research attention in the memory context but have been neglected as a stressor that can impact recovery. Drawing on theory, differential indirect links between unfinished tasks and sleep through affective rumination versus problem-solving pondering are examined. Further, the number of unfinished tasks extending over a 3-month period may impair employee sleep more than unfinished tasks within the acute phase. In this study, intraindividual links in a diary study supplemented by depicting between-person effects of unfinished tasks over a period of 3 months are examined. The authors matched 357 Friday and Monday observations over a 12-week interval for 59 employees. The results of the multilevel analysis suggest that the within-person relationship between unfinished tasks and sleep is mediated by affective rumination. Although problem-solving pondering was negatively related to sleep impairment, the indirect effect was not significant. Finally, beyond the acute effect, the authors found higher levels of unfinished tasks over 3 months are related to increased sleep impairment on the weekend.

D.","Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the occurrence of stressful life events in anxious and depressed children. Method: Children (6-12 years of age) with an anxiety disorder (n = 20), depression (n = 45), and normal controls (n = 11) were assessed using the Life Events Record. Cortisol was assessed from plasma samples collected every 20 minutes from an indwelling catheter in the one and two hour window around sleep onset. Results: Depressed children had significantly more events and events that were most likely independent of the child's behavior, compared to both the anxious and normal control children. Independent loss events were significantly more prevalent among the depressed children in the preceding year, compared to anxious children, with a trend toward more loss events compared to the normal controls. For both overall events and independent events, depressed females were significantly more likely to be exposed to stressful environments compared to anxious and normal control females. There were no effects of stress on cortisol secretion around sleep onset. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that stressful life events are significantly more likely to occur in depressed children, particularly females, compared to anxious children, and that these events are predominantly characterized by independent events outside of the child's control. The results also suggest that loss events may be specific for depression in children. Interestingly, stress does not apper to impact the HPA axis in children, which is true for anxious, depressed, and normal control children. The temporal occurrence and severity, as well as the type of stressful life events as they relate to the onset and maintenance of anxiety and depression in children, need to be more fully explored.",2005.0,10.1089/cap.2005.15.571,P7SIT56I,0,diathesis,165

Method Two thousand seventy-six children from 13 birth cohorts 4 to 16 years of age were drawn from Dutch birth registries in 1983. CBCLs were completed by parents at baseline when children from the different cohorts were 4 to 16 years of age and sampled every 2 years for the next 14 years. At year 14 the CBCL and DSM interview data were collected. Logistic regression was used to compare and contrast outcomes for children with and without dysregulation, as measured by the latent-classdefined CBCL-DP. Sex and age were covaried and concurrent DSM diagnoses were included in regression models. Results Presence of childhood CBCL-DP at wave 1 was associated with increased rates of adult anxiety disorders, mood disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, and drug abuse 14 years later. After controlling for co-occurring disorders in adulthood, associations with anxiety and disruptive behavior disorders with the CBCL-DP remained, whereas the others were not significant.

167,Psychiatric emergencies.,"Cavanaugh, S. V.","Psychiatric disorders are common in medical inpatient and outpatient populations. As a result, internists commonly are the first to see psychiatric emergencies. As with all medical problems, a good history, including a collateral history from relatives and friends, physical and mental status examination, and appropriate laboratory tests help establish a preliminary diagnosis and treatment plan. Patients with suicidal ideation usually have multiple stressors in the environment and/or a psychiatric disorder (i.e., a major affective disorder, dysthymic disorder, anxiety or panic disorder, psychotic disorder, alcohol or drug abuse, a personality disorder, and/or an adjustment disorder). Of all patients who commit suicide, 70 \ \% \ have a major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, psychotic organic mental disorder, alcoholism, drug abuse, and borderline personality disorder. Patients who are at great risk have minimal supports, a history of previous suicide attempts, a plan with high lethality, hopelessness, psychosis, paranoia, and/or command self-destructive hallucinations. Treatment is directed toward placing the patient in a protected environment and providing psychotropic medication and/or psychotherapy for the underlying psychiatric problem. Other psychiatric emergencies include psychotic and violent patients. Psychotic disorders fall into two categories etiologically: those that have an identifiable organic factor causing the psychosis and those that have an underlying psychiatric disorder. Initially, it is essential to rule out organic pathology that is life-threatening or could cause irreversible brain damage. After such organic causes are ruled out, neuroleptic medication is indicated. If the patient is not agitated or combative, he or she may be placed on oral divided doses of neuroleptics in the antipsychotic range. Patients who are agitated or psychotic need rapid tranquilization with an intramuscular neuroleptic every half hour to 1 hour until the agitation and combativeness are under control. Haloperidol (Haldol) is the safest neuroleptic. Chlorpromazine (Thorazine), perphenazine (Trilafon), and, in the elderly, thiothixene (Navane) can also be useful if haloperidol (Haldol) is not effective and more sedation is needed; these drugs, however, produce more side effects. Violent patients need to be physically restrained and then given antipsychotic medication or, in the case of drug abuse or alcohol withdrawal, the appropriate drug management.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1986.0,,SJ6W44HB,0,personality,168
168,"The impact of childhood abuse on inpatient substance users: specific links with risky sex, aggression, and emotion dysregulation.","An, Banducci; Em, Hoffman; Cw, Lejuez; Kc, Koenen","Adults with substance use disorders (SUDs) report a high prevalence of childhood abuse. Research in the general population suggests specific types of abuse lead to particular negative outcomes; it is not known whether this pattern holds for adults with SUDs. We hypothesized that specific types of abuse would be associated with particular behavioral and emotional outcomes among substance users. That is, childhood sexual abuse would be associated with risky sex behaviors, childhood physical abuse with aggression, and childhood emotional abuse with emotion dysregulation. 280 inpatients (M age=43.3; 69.7% male; 88.4% African American) in substance use treatment completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), HIV Risk-Taking Behavior Scale, Addiction Severity Index, Difficulties with Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS), and Affect Intensity and Dimensions of Affiliation Motivation (AIM). Consistent with our hypotheses, the CTQ sexual abuse subscale uniquely predicted exchanging sex for cocaine and heroin, number of arrests for prostitution, engaging in unprotected sex with a casual partner during the prior year, and experiencing low sexual arousal when sober. The physical abuse subscale uniquely predicted number of arrests for assault and weapons offenses. The emotional abuse subscale uniquely predicted the DERS total score, AIM score, and DTS score. Among substance users, different types of abuse are uniquely associated with specific negative effects. Assessment of specific abuse types among substance users may be informative in treatment planning and relapse prevention.",2014.0,10.1016/j.chiabu.2013.12.007,65RKNL4I,0,cognitive_additional,169

In the comparison group of adolescent girls, both attitude and subjective norms predicted intention to seek depression treatment (F = 8.56, P = .00, R(2) = .22). The addition of depressive symptoms and social support increased the explanatory power of the model in the comparison group of adolescent girls (R(2) change = 0.10, P = .02) but resulted in the deletion of subjective norms from the regression equation.

170,Efficacy of a brief school-based program for selective prevention of childhood anxiety.,"M, Balle; M, Tortella-Feliu","Anxiety sensitivity (AS) is recognized as an early risk factor for the development of anxiety disorders. This study evaluates whether a brief school-based selective prevention program reduces AS and anxious and depressive symptoms in children and youth. Participants scoring high in AS but without any current psychopathological disorder were selected from a sample of 613 individuals (61% female, 11-17 years old) and randomly assigned to the prevention program (n=47) or to a waiting-list control (WLC) (n=45) group. A normal control (NC) group (n=53) was also included. After treatment, a significant decrease in AS and in anxiety and depressive symptoms were observed in both prevention and WLC groups. Differences between experimental conditions only emerged, partially, at six-month follow-up (FU) with the prevention group (PG) exhibiting significantly lower AS (p<.05), and equalling NCs. Although the magnitude of change in the PG is comparable to that reported in previous studies with longer and more complex prevention programs, a parallel reduction in the WLCs suggests that the observed decrease in the short term could be mostly time-linked. Despite this, our results encourage research into brief preventive interventions at an individual level.",2010.0,10.1080/10615800802590652,6G6IVXYY,0,diathesis,171

M.; Jaworska, N.; Swansburg, R.; Jasaui, Y.; Zewdie, E.; Ciechanski, P.; et al.","Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common in youth and treatment options are limited. We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in adolescents and transitional aged youth with treatment‐resistant MDD. Methods: Thirty‐two outpatients with moderate to severe, treatment‐resistant MDD, aged 13 e 21 years underwent a three‐week, open‐label, single center trial of rTMS. rTMS was applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) using neuronavigation and administered for 15 consecutive weekdays (120% rest motor threshold; 40 pulses over 4 seconds [10 Hz]; inter‐train interval, 26 seconds; 75 trains; 3000 pulses). The primary outcome measure was change in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham‐D). Treatment response was defined as a greater than 50% reduction in Ham‐D scores. Safety and tolerability were also examined. Results: rTMS was effective in reducing MDD symptom severity (t = 8.94, df = 31, p < 0.00001). We observed 18 (56%) responders (greater than 50% reduction in Ham‐D score) and 14 non‐responders to rTMS. Fourteen subjects (44%) achieved remission (Ham‐D score ‐ 7 post‐rTMS). There were no serious adverse events (i.e. seizures). Mild to moderate, self‐limiting headaches (19%) and mild neck pain (16%) were reported. Participants ranked rTMS as highly tolerable. The retention rate was 91% and compliance rate (completing all study events) was 99%. Conclusions: Our single center, open trial suggests that rTMS is a safe and effective treatment for youth with treatment‐ resistant MDD. Larger randomized controlled trials are needed.",2018.0,,GS6XNAUP,0,additional,172

H.; Spitz, Bernard; Demyttenaere, Koen","Little is known about how an expecting woman's view of pregnancy, the child, and motherhood relates to antenatal and postpartum depressive symptomatology. In this study, we investigated the influence of the maternal orientations, as described by Raphael-Leff (Psychological processes of childbearing. The Anna Freud Centre, London, 2005), on the prevalence of depressive symptoms in pregnant and postpartum women. Four hundred three pregnant women participated in a longitudinal study and completed the EPDS and the HADS-D in each pregnancy trimester and between 8 to 12 and 20 to 25 weeks postpartum. In addition, measures of maternal orientation (PPQ), personality (NEO-FFI), coping styles (UCL), adult attachment (RQ), and parental bonding (PBI) were completed antenatally. Bivariate and multivariate analyses revealed that Neuroticism and the Regulator orientation are positively associated with the EPDS and HADS-D in both pregnant and postpartum women. These associations decreased in strength but remained significant after controlling for previous responses on the EPDS and HADS-D. Small negative associations were found between the Facilitator orientation and the HADS-D scores during pregnancy and the early postpartum period. However, this association did not hold its statistical significance within the hierarchical multiple regression models. The maternal orientations have a small but significant and independent contribution in the variance of depressive symptomatology in pregnant and postpartum women.",2009.0,10.1007/s00737-009-0061-x,3V8PQTRY,0,personality,173
173,Association of types of life events with depressive symptoms among Puerto Rican youth,"Jaschek, G.; Carter-Pokras, O. D.; He, X.; Lee, S.; Canino, G.","The main objective of this study was to examine the association between four types of adverse life events (family environment, separation, social adversity, and death) and the development of depressive symptoms among Puerto Rican youth. This was a secondary analysis using three waves (2000±2004) of interview data from the Boricua Youth Study of 10±13 year old Puerto Rican youth residing in New York and Puerto Rico with no depressive symptoms at baseline (n = 977). Depressive symptoms increased with an increase in social adversity, separation, death, and death events. Youth support from parents was a significant protective factor for all adverse events and parent coping was a protective factor in social adversity events. Relying on standard diagnostic tools is ideal to identify youth meeting the criteria for a diagnosis of depression but not useful to detect youth who present with subclinical levels of depression. Youth with sub-clinical levels of depression will not get treated and are at increased risk of developing depression later in life. Adverse life events are potentially relevant to use in conjunction with other screening tools to identify Puerto Rican youth who have subclinical depression and are at risk of developing depression in later adolescence.",2016.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0164852,K2JP7F8B,0,diathesis,174

Medical investigation yielded no organic cause for the vomiting which, on psychiatric evaluation, was found to be a conditioned response to stimuli from the depression that had started very shortly before the onset of the infarction. The conditioned vomiting was counter-conditioned by the use of small doses of ginger ale producing forward peristalsis. The depression was treated by the introduction of behaviors incompatible with the depression. At a 5-mo follow-up, the patient remained free of vomiting and the depression had ameliorated.

175,Depression in adults: Some basic facts,"McQueen, D.","This paper reviews some of the essential facts about depression in adults. The term can refer to a symptom, a syndrome or a diagnosis. As a symptom, it occurs in many mental disorders and physical diseases. The boundaries of depression are reviewed: depression is biologically distinct from bipolar affective disorder, but it overlaps with the other common neurotic conditions; the spectrum of depressive disorders, melancholia, depressive adjustment reactions and dysthymia is described. Categorical classifications of depression have many problems, but are currently necessary. The epidemiology of depression in adulthood is presented with reference to old age, after childbirth, its prognosis and long-term disability and the limitations of short-term treatments. The immediate causes of depression include complex interactions between life events and their personal meaning influenced by personality factors and neuroticism. Ethological perspectives indicate that depression may have both adaptive and maladaptive aspects. \ \textcopyright \ 2009 The Association for Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy in the NHS.",2009.0,,4A2WX2IP,0,personality,176

Self-report data on depression and anxiety were collected from community-dwelling older respondents (aged over 55 yrs) on two occasions, 3 years apart. Data from 1,810 emotionally healthy respondents were used to investigate the effects of long-standing vulnerability factors and stressful life events. After 3 years 9 \% of the Ss had scored beyond the thresholds for symptoms. Vulnerability for depression and anxiety was quite similar, but life events differed: onset of depression was predicted by death of a partner or other relatives; onset of anxiety was best predicted by having a partner who developed a major illness. No support for moderator effects between vulnerability factors and stress was found; the effects were purely additive. Depression and anxiety have many risk factors in common, but specific risk factors also were found, especially in subjects developing both depression and anxiety.

In addition, we examined mediation models in an attempt to clarify the link between adult attachment and these two dimensions of psychopathology. In testing these models, we administered the ASQ, General Self-Efficacy Scale, Agoraphobic Catastrophic Cognitions Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, and the Mobility Inventory for Agoraphobia (a measure of the degree to which situations are avoided that are typically anxiety provoking for people with agoraphobia) to 122 participants (44 with agoraphobia, 25 with a current major depressive disorder, and 53 with no current psychopathology). The results showed that the insecure attachment dimensions of need for approval, preoccupation with relationships, and relationships as secondary were uniquely associated with depression and that general self-efficacy partly mediated the relationship between need for approval and depression. In contrast, only preoccupation with relationships was uniquely associated with agoraphobic behavior, and catastrophic cognitions about bodily sensations partly mediated this association.

The aim of the present study was therefore to examine these associations in a large cohort of Australian offenders using Cloninger's Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI). METHODS: A total of 1322 prisoners from New South Wales (NSW) who completed all dimensions of the TCI and were screened for mental illness using the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing were included in the study. RESULTS: A total of 15 \ \% \ of the sample fulfilled the criteria for a diagnosis for depression, 36 \ \% \ for anxiety disorders and 54 \ \% \ for a substance abuse disorder. Using logistic regression analysis, the TCI dimensions of harm-avoidance and low self-direction predicted depression. Being female, a poly-substance user and having high harm-avoidance, persistence, self-direction and self-transcendence predicted anxiety disorders. Significant stepped trends across age, gender, and type of drug use were found for all TCI dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: The TCI is useful in identifying prisoners with a history of psychopathology and substance misuse. This tool also provides clinically relevant information about at-risk individuals and has the potential to guide the development of intervention programmes for inmates.",2008.0,10.1080/00048670802415350,Z9B46JC5,0,personality,181

J. and","Background: Experimental animal research shows that immunologic defenses against tumor cells are disturbed by surgical trauma, resulting in an increased rate of tumor implantation and the growth of subsequent metastases. Minimally invasive surgery is associated with a preservation of postoperative immunologic functions and, in animal models, with decreased tumor growth. The objective was to study the influence of several surgical procedures, approached conventionally and laparoscopically, on interleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte-mediated cytotoxicity (MMC). Methods: Five groups of five patients each were included in this prospective study: laparoscopic cholecystectomy (minor trauma) group, Nissen fundoplication (laparoscopic and conventional as moderate trauma) groups, and sigmoid colectomy (laparoscopic and conventional as major trauma) groups. Preoperatively, 1 and 4 days after surgery, IL-6 and MMC against SW948 colon cancer cell line were determined. Results: The IL-6 levels differed significantly between the three laparoscopic procedures (p = 0.004) and increased according to the degree of trauma. There was no significant difference in MMC between the three laparoscopic procedures. However, MMC was suppressed after conventional procedures and preserved after laparoscopic procedures (p = 0.001). There was no correlation between IL-6 levels and changes in MMC. Conclusions: More extensive laparoscopic procedures induce increased levels of IL-6, reflecting higher levels of trauma. Conventional surgical procedures result in depressed MMC in the postoperative period. After laparoscopic procedures, MMC is preserved. These findings may be of importance in preventing implantation and growth of cancer cells spread by surgical manipulation.",2000.0,10.1007/s004640000161,WVN78TAQ,0,cognitive_additional,182

There is a lack of study examining the correlation between depression, anxiety and quality of life (QoL) with perceived social support (PSS) among breast cancer patients. This study aims to study the level of depression, anxiety, QoL and PSS among Malaysian breast cancer women over a period of 12 months and their associations at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Methods: It is a 12 months prospective cohort study. Two hundred and twenty one female patients were included in the study. They were assessed at the time of diagnosis, 6 months and 12 month using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30), Version 3.0 of the EORTC Study Group and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). The information of age, ethnicity, types of treatment, and staging of cancer were collected. Results: The HADS anxiety and depression subscales scores of the subjects were relatively low. The level of anxiety reduced significantly at 6 and 12 months (Baseline - 6 months, p = 0.002; Baseline - 12 months, p \textless 0.001). There were no changes in the level of depression over the study period. The global status of QoL and MSPSS scores were relatively high. Correlation between the global status of QoL and MSPSS for the study subjects was positive (Spearman's rho = 0.31-0.36). Global status of QoL and MSPSS scores were negatively correlated with anxiety and depression.

This study examined cognitive and affective empathy and perceived popularity and their relation to each of the five steps of the Bystander Intervention Model in Bullying (Nickerson, Aloe, Livingston, & Feeley, 2014), as well as explored if gender changed those relations. With a sample of 346 sixth to eighth grade students, we found a negative relation between perceived popularity and noticing bullying events. For boys, higher affective empathy was associated with a greater likelihood of interpreting bullying as an emergency and accepting responsibility for intervening, but for girls, their perception of bullying as an emergency and accepting responsibility was stable regardless of their level of affective empathy.

184,"Primary malignant brain tumours, psychosocial distress and the intimate partner experience: what do we know?","Sabo, Brenda","From the time of diagnosis of a primary malignant brain tumour (PMBT) and throughout the illness trajectory, the patient and intimate partner face many psychosocial challenges ranging from fear and uncertainty to hope and loss (Fox \ \& \ Lantz, 1998; Janda et al., 2007; Kvale, Murthy, Taylor, Lee, \ \& \ Nabors, 2009). While many patients diagnosed with cancer may go on to live with cancer as a chronic illness, this may not be said of individuals diagnosed with a PMBT, in particular those diagnosed with a glioma, the most common form of brain tumour (Gupta \ \& \ Sarin, 2002). Gliomas are associated with a short disease trajectory and multiple deficits (functional, cognitive and psychiatric). What makes the PMBT experience unique from other cancers is that the intimate partner must not only deal with the diagnosis of cancer in their spouse, but also the accompanying personality, functional and behavioural changes wrought by the disease, as well as grieve the loss of the person they once knew (Sherwood et al., 2004). These multi-dimensional deficits are thought to place the intimate partner, as caregiver, at greater risk for adverse psychosocial effects such as anxiety, depression and post traumatic stress (Goebel, von Harscher, \ \& \ Mehdorn, 2011; Keir, Farland, Lipp, \ \& \ Friedman, 2009). The following discussion will provide an overview of the extant literature on the experience of living with a PMBT from the intimate partner (spouse) perspective with a particular emphasis on how intimate partners cope. The intimate partner is considered to be the heterosexual or same-sex, married or common-law partner of the patient.

Differences could relate to behavioral inhibition or lack of positive affect and altered response to reward. To determine long-term behavioral effects, the study was a follow-up of a randomized controlled trial of behavioral/developmental effects of preventing IDA in infancy. Healthy Chilean infants free of IDA at age 6 mo were randomly assigned to iron supplementation or no added iron (formula with iron/powdered cow milk, vitamins with/without iron) from ages 6 to 12 mo. At age 10 y, 59% (666 of 1123) and 68% (366 of 534) of iron-supplemented and no-added-iron groups were assessed. Social-emotional outcomes included maternal-reported behavior problems, self-reported behavior, examiner ratings, and video coding of a social stress task and gamelike paradigms. Examiners rated the iron-supplemented group as more cooperative, confident, persistent after failure, coordinated, and direct and reality-oriented in speech and working harder after praise compared with the no-added-iron group. In a task designed to elicit positive affect, supplemented children spent more time laughing and smiling together with their mothers and started smiling more quickly. In the social stress task they smiled and laughed more and needed less prompting to complete the task. All P values were <0.05; effect sizes were 0.14-0.36. There were no differences in behaviors related to behavioral inhibition, such as anxiety/depression or social problems. In sum, iron supplementation in infancy was associated with more adaptive behavior at age 10 y, especially in affect and response to reward, which may improve performance at school and work, mental health, and personal relationships.",2014.0,10.3945/jn.113.182048,6VM3JMSF,0,diathesis,187

However, the effectiveness and acceptability of third-wave cognitive and behavioural therapy (CBT) approaches as treatment for acute depression remain unclear.Objectives: 1. To examine the effects of all third wave CBT approaches compared with treatment as usual/waiting list/attention placebo/psychological placebo control conditions for acute depression.2. To examine the effects of different third wave CBT approaches (ACT, compassionate mind training, functional analytic psychotherapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, MBCT, extended behavioural activation and metacognitive therapy) compared with treatment as usual/waiting list/attention placebo/psychological placebo control conditions for acute depression.3. To examine the effects of all third wave CBT approaches compared with different types of comparators (treatment as usual, no treatment, waiting list, attention placebo, psychological placebo) for acute depression.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Depression Anxiety and Neurosis Group Trials Specialised Register (CCDANCTR to 01/01/12), which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE, (1974-), MEDLINE (1950-) and PsycINFO (1967-). We also searched CINAHL (May 2010) and PSYNDEX (June 2010) and reference lists of the included studies and relevant reviews for additional published and unpublished studies. An updated search of CCDANCTR restricted to search terms relevant to third wave CBT therapies was conducted in March 2013 (CCDANCTR to 01/02/13).Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials that compared third wave CBT therapies with control conditions for acute depression in adults.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently identified studies, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information when required. We rated the quality of evidence using GRADE methods.Main results: Four small studies (224 participants) were included in the review. Little information was provided about the process of allocating participants to groups. None of the studies used independent outcome assessors, and evidence suggested researcher allegiance towards the active treatments. The four studies examined a diversity of third wave CBT approaches (extended behavioural activation, acceptance and commitment therapy and competitive memory training) and control conditions. None of the studies conducted follow-up assessments. The results showed a significant difference in clinical response rates in favour of third wave CBT when compared with treatment as usual (TAU) conditions (three studies, 170 participants, risk ratio (RR) 0.51, 95 \% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 0.95; very low quality). No significant difference in treatment acceptability based on dropout rates was found between third wave CBT approaches and TAU (four studies, 224 participants, RR 1.01, 95 \% CI 0.08 to 12.30; very low quality). Both analyses showed substantial statistical heterogeneity.Authors' conclusions: Very low quality evidence suggests that third wave CBT approaches appear to be more effective than treatment as usual in the treatment of acute depression. The very small number of available studies and the diverse types of interventions and control comparators, together with methodological limitations, limit the ability to draw any conclusions on their effect in the short term or over a longer term. The increasing popularity of third wave CBT approaches in clinical practice underscores the importance of completing further studies of third wave CBT approaches in the treatment of acute depression, on a short- and long-term basis, to provide evidence of their effectiveness to policy-makers, clinicians and users of services.",2013.0,10/gbd385,5FS582JP,0,psychodynamic,188

During the years preceding the diagnosis and hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) they had often isolated themselves as they felt different from their peers. Ovarian failure and infertiliy, not the body height, were the major problems for most of the women. Infertility had affected the women very deeply and many felt depressed because of this. Adolescent behaviour, a feeling of chronic inferiority or a feeling of grief were different ways of coping with the situation. Median age at sexual debut was 19.5 years. Painful intercourse related to vaginal constriction and sore membranes was commonly reported. Most of the women had stopped HRT because of side-effects.

Yet, whether Facebook use influences subjective well-being over time is unknown. We addressed this issue using experience-sampling, the most reliable method for measuring in-vivo behavior and psychological experience. We text-messaged people five times per day for two-weeks to examine how Facebook use influences the two components of subjective well-being: how people feel moment-to-moment and how satisfied they are with their lives. Our results indicate that Facebook use predicts negative shifts on both of these variables over time. The more people used Facebook at one time point, the worse they felt the next time we text-messaged them; the more they used Facebook over two-weeks, the more their life satisfaction levels declined over time. Interacting with other people directly did not predict these negative outcomes. They were also not moderated by the size of people's Facebook networks, their perceived supportiveness, motivation for using Facebook, gender, loneliness, self-esteem, or depression. On the surface, Facebook provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling the basic human need for social connection. Rather than enhancing well-being, however, these findings suggest that Facebook may undermine it. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",,,JYIFRXRG,0,psychodynamic,190

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypotheses that, compared with placebo, concomitant treatment with nortriptline or venlafaxine during the ECT course enhances short-term efficacy without a meaningful effect on adverse effects and reduces the rate of post-ECT relapse, and to test the hypotheses that high-dose, right-sided, unilateral ECT is equivalent in efficacy to moderate-dosage bilateral ECT and retains advantages with respect to cognitive adverse effects. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, triple-masked, placebo-controlled study conducted from 2001 through 2005. SETTING: Three university-based hospitals. PATIENTS: Of approximately 750 consecutive patients referred for ECT, 319 with a major depressive episode consented, were randomized to pharmacological or ECT treatment conditions, and received at least 1 ECT treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, remission rate following completion of ECT, and selective measures of cognitive adverse effects. RESULTS: Treatment with nortriptyline enhanced the efficacy and reduced the cognitive adverse effects of ECT relative to placebo. Venlafaxine resulted in a weaker degree of improvement and tended to worsen cognitive adverse effects. High-dosage right unilateral ECT did not differ or was superior to bilateral ECT in efficacy and resulted in less severe amnesia. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of ECT is substantially increased by the addition of an antidepressant medication, but such medications may differ in whether they reduce or increase cognitive adverse effects. High-dose, right-sided, unilateral ECT is at least equivalent to moderate-dosage bilateral ECT in efficacy, but retains advantages with respect to cognitive adverse effects.",2009.0,10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2009.75,XPNUEQY2,0,cognitive,191
191,Psychotherapy for depression: a randomized clinical trial comparing schema therapy and cognitive behavior therapy.,"Carter, Janet D.; McIntosh, Virginia V.; Jordan, Jennifer; Porter, Richard J.; Frampton, Christopher M.; Joyce, Peter R.","BACKGROUND: The efficacy of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) for depression has been robustly supported, however, up to fifty percent of individuals do not respond fully. A growing body of research indicates Schema Therapy (ST) is an effective treatment for difficult and entrenched problems, and as such, may be an effective therapy for depression. METHODS: In this randomized clinical trial the comparative efficacy of CBT and ST for depression was examined. 100 participants with major depression received weekly cognitive behavioral therapy or schema therapy sessions for 6 months, followed by monthly therapy sessions for 6 months. Key outcomes were comparisons over the weekly and monthly sessions of therapy along with remission and recovery rates. Additional analyses examined outcome for those with chronic depression and comorbid personality disorders. RESULTS: ST was not significantly better (nor worse) than CBT for the treatment of depression. The therapies were of comparable efficacy on all key outcomes. There were no differential treatment effects for those with chronic depression or comorbid personality disorders. LIMITATIONS: This study needs replication. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary research indicates that ST may provide an effective alternative therapy for depression.",2013.0,10.1016/j.jad.2013.06.034,HW9E5FDD,0,cognitive,192

S.; Atkinson, L.","Both maternal depressive symptoms and infants' dopamine-related genetic characteristics have been linked to infants' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) functioning. This study investigated the interactive influence of maternal depressive symptoms and infant DRD2 and SLC6A3 genotypes on infant cortisol reactivity; whether this interaction reflects diathesis-stress or differential susceptibility; and whether this interaction influences the flexibility of the infant cortisol response across challenges known to exert differential effects on infant cortisol reactivity. A community sample of 314 mother-infant dyads participated in toy frustration (age 16 months) and maternal separation (age 17 months) challenges, and salivary cortisol was collected at baseline, +20, and +40. min. Maternal depressive symptoms were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II at infant age 16 months. Infant buccal cells were collected at both time points for genotyping. DRD2 and SLC6A3 genotypes moderated the relation between maternal depressive symptomatology and infant cortisol reactivity in a diathesis-stress manner in the context of toy frustration, and in a differential susceptibility manner in the context of maternal separation. Higher levels of maternal depressive symptoms predicted reduced cortisol flexibility across challenges for infants with at least one A1 allele of DRD2 and infants with the 10/10 genotype of SLC6A3. Results suggest that maternal depressive symptomatology is related to infants' cortisol reactivity and to the flexibility of that reactivity across psychosocial challenges, but this relation is dependent on the infant's genetic characteristics.",2015.0,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.08.026,PDSZ7QW7,0,diathesis,193
193,"Parental drinking as a predictor of cognitive style, depression, and hopelessness.","Bluth, George Joseph","This study conceptualized some of the variables identified in previous research on ACOAs into a model to test whether their depression could be accounted for by the depressogenic attributional style associated with the Hopelessness Theory of Depression. The model posits that ACOA status is predictive of depression, but the relationship is mediated by the depressogenic attributional style. Further, the degree of parental conflict was expected to moderate the relationship between ACOA status and attributional style. Since gender and social support are important predictors of depression, they have been included, however assumed no particular status in the model. The model was tested with two outcome variables: depression and hopelessness. ACOA status was operationalized through the use of the Children of Alcoholics Screening Test (CAST). Depressogenic attributional style was measured through the Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ). The first outcome measure, depression, was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); the second outcome measure was assessed utilizing the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS). The presence of family conflict, was measured by the Family Environment Scale (FES). Gender and social support were included, with social support measured through the Social Support Questionnaire - Brief Form (SSQ6). The sample was drawn from a community college in the Southwest and consisted of 196 predominantly Caucasian, female, and relatively high functioning individuals. Data analysis tested the model separately with mother's, father's, and both mother's and father's alcohol status as predictor variables. Regression analyses using depression as the primary outcome variable and ACOA status as the predictor, indicated that none of the models met the criteria for the test of a mediational effect. The model closest to statistical significance was in the father's alcohol status predicting depression.

There was no support for sex-linked inheritance in either group or for further genetic subdivision of the unipolar group according to age of onset or alcoholic or psychopathic family history.

196,Situational expectations mediate the effect of global beliefs on depressive symptoms: a 1-year prospective study using a student sample,"Kube, T.; Glombiewski, J. A.; Rief, W.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recent research suggests that expectations might be a particularly important subgroup of cognitions in major depression. The present study aimed to further specify the role of situation-specific dysfunctional expectations (SDEs) in the development of depressive symptoms. It was hypothesized that the effects of intermediate beliefs and dispositional optimism on depressive symptoms would be mediated via SDEs. RECENT FINDINGS: We examined 125 students (age M = 22.05, SD = 4.00, 74.6% women) using a longitudinal design with a 1-year follow-up. Questionnaires used in the study included the Depressive Expectations Scale, Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale, Life Orientation Test and Beck's Depression Inventory. When considering SDEs at baseline as mediator variable, neither intermediate beliefs nor dispositional optimism had significant direct effects on depressive symptoms. Instead, their effects were fully mediated via SDEs. When considering SDEs at the follow-up as the mediator variable, SDEs partly mediated the effects of intermediate beliefs and dispositional optimism on depressive symptoms. SUMMARY: The study provides further evidence for a cognitive mediational model, suggesting that SDEs mediate the effects of rather global beliefs (such as intermediate beliefs and dispositional optimism) on depressive symptoms. Due to their high level of situational specificity, SDEs might be an effective target for cognitive-behavioural interventions.",2018.0,10.1097/yco.0000000000000443,FN2Q4JEJ,0,additional,197

H.","This paper examined the interrelation between social support and coping in a longitudinal study of 380 clinically depressed individuals. A two-wave, two-variable panel analysis revealed that connections between support and coping varied by gender and across the specific sources of support and modes of coping examined. In the family context, increases in support were related to increases in problem-solving coping among women and to a decline in emotional discharge coping among men. In the work context, increases in social support were related to a greater reliance on affective regulation among women and to more information/support seeking among men. Overall, the results suggest that specific aspects of support and coping processes jointly mediate the link between stress and adjustment among depressed individuals.",1987.0,,F9T7C68M,0,behavior,198

199,Disorder-specific psychosocial interventions for bipolar disorder--a systematic review of the evidence for mental health nursing practice.,"Crowe, Marie; Whitehead, Lisa; Wilson, Lynere; Carlyle, Dave; O'Brien, Anthony; Inder, Maree; Joyce, Peter","AIMS: To systematically review the evidence for the efficacy of psychosocial interventions for bipolar disorder and examine the implications for mental health nursing practice. BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder is associated with significant psychosocial impairment and high use of mental health services. Generally medication is effective in the treatment of acute episodes but there is increasing evidence that while a large majority of patients recover from these episodes of mania and/or depression, many do not achieve a functional recovery. In response a range of psychotherapies have either been adapted or developed. DESIGN: An extensive review of the literature was performed using Medline, Cinahl and PsycINFO databases and 35 relevant research studies were chosen that met inclusion criteria. FINDINGS: All the identified psychosocial interventions were structured, adhered to manualized protocols and had solid evidence demonstrating their effectiveness when used as an adjunct to psychopharmacology. The identified psychosocial interventions all incorporated some features of a psycho-education including developing an acceptance of the disorder, awareness of its prodromes and signs of relapse, and communication with others; and several emphasise regular sleep and activity habits. CONCLUSION: Mental health nurses have an important role to play in integrating psychosocial interventions into their clinical practice settings and in conducting high quality trials of their clinical effectiveness. Nurses are well-positioned to lead pragmatic trials of the clinical effectiveness of these psychosocial interventions in mental health services because of their experience and expertise in working with patients with bipolar disorder.",2010.0,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2010.02.012,FA7WCFDL,0,cognitive,200
200,The distressed (Type D) personality in both patients and partners enhances the risk of emotional distress in patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.,"van den Broek, Krista C.; Versteeg, Henneke; Erdman, Ruud A. M.; Pedersen, Susanne S.","BACKGROUND: A subgroup of patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) experiences emotional distress. This may be related to partner factors. We examined the impact of the personality of the partner (i.e., the distressed (Type D) personality) in combination with that of the patient on anxiety and depression levels in ICD patients. METHODS: Consecutively implanted ICD patients (N=281; 80.1 \ \% \ men; mean age=58.3+/-11.0) and their partners (N=281; 20.6 \ \% \ men; mean age=56.5+/-11.7) completed the Type D Scale at baseline; patients also completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at baseline and 6 months post-implantation. RESULTS: ANOVA for repeated measures, using the Type D main effects and the interaction effect, showed that the interaction time by Type D patient by Type D partner was significant (F((1,277))=7.0, p=.009) for depression as outcome, but not for anxiety (F((1,277))=3.1, p=.08). Post-hoc comparisons revealed that Type D patients with a Type D partner (n=23/281, 8.2 \ \% \ ) experienced the highest depression levels compared to other personality combinations (all ps \ \textless \ .05). LIMITATIONS: The group of Type D patients with a Type D partner was rather small. CONCLUSIONS: ICD patients with a Type D personality report more depressive symptoms, but not anxiety, if the partner also has a Type D personality. This may be due to poor communication and lack of emotional support in the relationship. These results emphasize the importance of taking into account the psychological profile of the partner in the management and care of the ICD patient, and to direct behavioural support not only at the ICD patient but also at the partner.",2011.0,10.1016/j.jad.2010.10.044,73LS4RIH,0,personality,201
201,Need for care and perceptions of MIDAS among headache sufferers study.,"Stewart, Walter; Lipton, Richard","INTRODUCTION: Patients with migraine have varying medical care needs. To effectively stratify patients to appropriate care, physicians should consider the frequency and intensity of attacks, and their overall impact on ability to function. The Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) measures headache-related disability. The MIDAS Perceptions Study investigated whether MIDAS scores reflect headache severity and the need for medical care, and assessed whether the MIDAS questionnaire is meaningful and relevant to patients, and easy to use. DESIGN: The Perceptions Study was conducted as a follow-up to a baseline telephone interview. Upon completion of the baseline survey, 471 individuals were invited to participate in the Perceptions Study and 420 participated: 168 patients with migraine headaches and 253 with non-migraine headaches. Patients with migraine or non-migraine headaches completed the MIDAS questionnaire and the Center of Epidemiologic Studies of Depression (CES-D) questionnaire, and were then interviewed by telephone within 48 hours of receiving the questionnaires. RESULTS: Headache frequency and pain intensity increased significantly with increasing MIDAS grade (p \textless 0.0001). A pattern of decreasing quality-of-life scores on the physical and mental subscales of the Short Form-12 was also seen with increasing MIDAS grade. Scores on the CES-D scale increased significantly with increasing MIDAS grade (p \textless 0.0001), indicating a greater likelihood of depression and more severe depression with higher grades. There were significant associations between increasing MIDAS grade and an increasing proportion of individuals who had consulted a doctor within the past year, lower use of over-the-counter medication, and greater use of prescription medications (p \textless 0.0001 for all three variables). Satisfaction with current therapy decreased significantly with increasing MIDAS grade, mirroring the frequency with which individuals achieved complete relief from headache. The MIDAS questionnaire was rated as easy to use by the vast majority of respondents, and ratings of its perceived value increased significantly as MIDAS grade increased. CONCLUSIONS: A low MIDAS score generally seems to indicate a low need for care, while individuals in MIDAS grades III and IV appear to have significant unmet medical care needs. The MIDAS questionnaire had increasingly perceived relevance as MIDAS grade increased, helped the majority of those in MIDAS grades III and IV to understand the impact of their headaches, and encouraged those with the greatest disability to seek medical care. The MIDAS questionnaire may facilitate communication between doctors and patients, and help physicians to identify those receiving inadequate medical care.",2002.0,,52NMH5DF,0,psychodynamic,202
202,Behavioral sensitization effected by variable anxiogenic challenge and psychogenic stressor exposure in anxiety and motivational paradigms in CD-1 mice: In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical determinations in selective mesocorticolimbic sites.,"Hebb, Andrea Lyn Olding","It is well documented that stressful life experiences contribute to the etiology of human mood disorders. Arguments for behavioural and neurochemical conditioning and sensitization have been proposed in documentation pertaining to the vulnerability of clinical populations to relapse, the history of such relapses and symptom exacerbation, over protracted intervals. A role for cholecystokinin (CCK) in the induction and persistence of anxiety and major depression in infrahuman and human subjects appears to be conspicuous. While increased cerebrospinal (CSF) CCK has been associated with motivational loss, anticipatory anxiety and panic increased enkephalin (ENK) availability in humans has been associated with coping and mood elevation. The present series of experiments provide behavioral evidence for a CCK-ENK interface in the modulation of anxiety and motivation following psychogenic and pharmacological stressor applications. In particular, exposure of CD-1 mice to predator odors increased anxiety in the light-dark box immediately following odor exposure. Anxiety was associated with increased CCK mRNA and decreased ENK mRNA from sub-areas of the amygdala and nucleus accumbens. These changes in CCK and ENK gene expression were transient and were not associated with protracted levels of anxiety. In contrast, repeated exposure of CD-1 mice to the startle stimulus following varying durations of predator exposure resulted in an exaggeration of startle reactivity for up to one week following odor exposure. In contrast to enhanced anxiety in the light-dark box and startle paradigms, predator exposure did not influence reward thresholds among mice responding for brain stimulation from the dorsal aspects of the VTA. The experimental parameters underlying the manifestation of fear and anxiety in CD-1 mice following psychogenic stressor challenge were paralleled by pharmacological assessment of the anxiogenic and anxiolytic influence of central CCK and enkephalin administration, respectively, within these identical paradigms. In pharmacological investigations, the sensitizing effect of a previous anxiogenic dose of CCK-8 sulfated (CCK-8S) to a CCK challenge dose was blocked by coactivation of mu; and delta; receptors by the enkephalin agonist DALA in an ICSS but not an exploration paradigm among CD-1 mice. Interestingly, administration of intraventricular CCK-8S or systemic Boc CCK-4 increased acoustic startle in mice dependent upon the stressor history of the animal. These data parallel other studies evaluating the propensity of traditional anxiolytic and antidepressant agents to counteract the sensitization process. Evidently, the light dark task, acoustic startle, ICSS and exploration paradigms appear to be differentially sensitive to diverse stressor applications and site specific alterations in mesocorticolimbic ENK and CCK may underlie the expression of anxiety-like behavior within these paradigms. In effect, while CCK induces relatively protracted behavioral disturbances in both infrahuman and human subjects following stressor applications, mu;/delta; receptor activation may change the course of psychopathology. Potential anxiogenic and mnemonic influences of mesocorticolimbic CCK and ENK availability as well as the time course and underlying neuronal substrates of long-term behavioral disturbances (i.e., behavioral sensitization) as a result of stressor manipulations are discussed.

203,Risk Factors for Geriatric Depression: The Importance of Executive Functioning Within the Vascular Depression Hypothesis.,"Mast, Benjamin T.; Yochim, Brian; MacNeill, Susan E.; Lichtenberg, Peter A.","Background. Results from recent studies addressing the vascular depression hypothesis have been mixed, with cerebrovascular risk factors (CVRFs) predicting depression in some geriatric patients but not in others. The current study seeks to examine executive dysfunction as a potential moderator of the relationship between CVRFs and depressive symptoms. Methods. Data concerning CVRFs, executive functioning, and depressive symptoms from 77 geriatric rehabilitation patients were incorporated to test the hypothesis that patients with executive dysfunction and greater CVRFs would demonstrate the highest levels of depression over time. CVRFs (diabetes, hypertension, atrial fibrillation) were measured via diagnosis by treating physician. Depression was assessed using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) at baseline and at 6-month and 18-month follow-ups. Executive functioning was measured at baseline using the Initiation/ Perseveration (IP) Subtest of the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale. Results. Multivariate analysis of variance demonstrated a significant statistical interaction between the number of CVRFs and scores on the IP Subtest on depressive symptoms. Patients with two or more CVRFs and lower IP scores demonstrated significantly greater depressive symptoms at baseline and at 18-month follow-up than patients with fewer CVRFs and higher IP scores. The univariate effect at 6 months was not significant. Conclusion. The current data suggest that scores on an index of executive functioning may moderate the relationship between CVRFs and depressive symptoms. Interpretation of these findings is provided in the context of the vascular depression hypothesis and related frontostriatal dysfunction. Patients with greater CVRF burden and poor executive functioning may be at particularly high risk for depression.

The purpose of this study was to examine the cognitive response to treatment for patients with late-life depression. METHOD: Subjects included 45 nondemented, elderly depressed patients who achieved remission after 12 weeks of antidepressant treatment and 20 elderly comparison subjects. All subjects were administered a battery of clinical measures, including cognitive screening instruments, before and after treatment. RESULTS: As a group, the elderly depressed patients showed a small improvement in overall cognitive functioning after treatment. Among depressed patients with concomitant cognitive impairment at baseline, performance on the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale domains of conceptualization and initiation/perseveration improved significantly relative to those of depressed patients with normal cognition. Despite the improvement following treatment, the overall level of cognitive functioning in the elderly depressed patients with cognitive impairment at baseline remained mildly impaired, especially in the memory and initiation/perseveration domains. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly depressed patients with cognitive impairment may experience improvement in specific domains following antidepressant treatment but may not necessarily reach normal levels of performance, particularly in memory and executive functions.

G.; Jalaludin, B. B.; Kemp, L. A.; Phung, H. N.; Barnett, B. E. W.","Background: From 2000 a routine survey of mothers with newborn infants was commenced in South Western Sydney. The survey included the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence and risk factors for postnatal depressive symptoms in women living in metropolitan Sydney, Australia. Methods: Mothers (n=15,389) delivering in 2002 and 2003 were assessed at 2-3 weeks after delivery for risk factors for depressive symptoms. The binary outcome variables were EPDS \textgreater 9 and \textgreater 12. Logistic regression was used for the multivariate analysis.Results: The prevalence of EPDS \textgreater 9 was 16.93 per 100 (95 \% CI: 16.34 to 17.52) and EPDS \textgreater 12 was 7.73 per 100 (95 \% CI: 6.96 to 7.78). The final parsimonious logistic regression models included measures of infant behaviour, financial stress, mother's expectation of motherhood, emotional support, sole parenthood, social support and mother's country of birth. Conclusions: Infant temperament and unmet maternal expectations have a strong association with depressive symptoms with implications for the design of both preventative and treatment strategies. The findings also support the proposition that social exclusion and social isolation are important determinants of maternal depression. \textcopyright 2012 Eastwood et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2012.0,10.1186/1471-2393-12-148,6HATGZ9B,0,diathesis,208
208,Seduction is not yet betrayal: Trust and the essence of truth for Heidegger and Freud.,"Britt, William G. I. V.","This project takes up the old question of the nature of truth by seeking to say, at one stroke, both what enables truth and falsity and what lets them matter to us so centrally. Somehow, we as human beings are fundamentally connected to a world in which the truth of statements and the genuineness of things can matter to us deeply and coherently. And yet, I try to show, this coherent unity between being and thinking can also be radically (if not always permanently) broken in the experience of psychosis. I argue that the source of that vulnerable unity must be a contingent event in which I find myself disposed trustingly toward the world, and therein find the world disclosed as trustworthy. Such primitive trust is phenomenally related to trusting a person, and Freudian psychoanalysis shows us that it develops psychologically through relation to a person. As what fundamentally structures self and world, however, this kind of attunement transcends psychology. Our very access to the being of things, i.e., to their compelling importance and organized significance, depends upon it. Thus, I support Martin Heidegger's account of the essence of truth as what first makes accessible the comparisons (between word and thing, for example) on which more traditional theories of truth are based. Yet I also confront Heidegger's phenomenological version of trust by highlighting what is at stake ontologically in our interpersonal psychic development, which psychoanalysis reveals to take place by way of seduction. Heidegger assumes that being must show itself, even if in a concealed way, and thus always takes absence as withdrawal or absencing, rather than as a radical break. By attending to the meaningful phenomena of psychosis, I defend the thesis that our relation to the world is instead opened up and sustained by a fundamental affective attunement (trust) that can dramatically fail. In other words, I try to show that we are exposed to a more radical kind of concealment than Heidegger's thinking of truth seems able to do justice to, a failure of being that can thoroughly overwhelm us.

The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of MDD on the electrophysiological correlates - the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and the P300 - of active and observational reward processing and to relate them to trait cognitive and affective empathy. Eighteen patients with MDD and 16 healthy controls performed an active and an observational probabilistic reward-learning task while event- related potentials were recorded. Also, participants were assessed with regard to self-reported cognitive and affective trait empathy. Relative to healthy controls, patients with MDD showed overall impaired learning and attenuated FRN amplitudes, irrespective of feedback valence and learning type (active vs. observational), but comparable P300 amplitudes. In the patient group, but not in controls, higher trait perspective taking scores were significantly correlated with reduced FRN amplitudes. The pattern of results suggests impaired prediction error processing and a negative effect of higher trait empathy on feedback-based learning in patients with MDD.",2015.0,,JJC9GGHW,0,behavior,211
211,"Suicidal intent, hopelessness and depression in a parasuicide population: the influence of social desirability and elapsed time.","Salter, D.; Platt, S.","This paper reports the first British study to assess the construct validity of Beck's Hopelessness Scale (HS) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). On the basis of interviews with 50 economically active parasuicide patients, it was confirmed that hopelessness accounts for the relationship between depression and suicidal intent. Moreover, it was shown that social desirability neither confounds the relationship between hopelessness and suicidal intent, nor has any predictive power in explaining variation in suicidal intent. On the other hand, the interval ('elapsed time') between the commencement of the parasuicidal act and of the research interview was significantly and positively correlated with suicidal intent, and elapsed time was a significant predictor of the total score on Beck's Suicidal Intent Scale. Two explanations for this finding are proposed: the first is based on the possibility that elapsed time is an indirect or proxy measure of medical seriousness; the second derives from the likely impact of prolonged hospital stay on the patient's interpretation or understanding of his/her behaviour. Researchers are advised to take into account the moderating effect of elapsed time when designing studies which examine psychological processes in parasuicide.",1990.0,,536K76H9,0,cognitive,212
212,Extended working through after analysis: A thirteen-year follow-up initiated by patient correspondence.,"Kaplan, Eugene H.","Presents the case history of a college-educated female homemaker with 2 children who began therapy at 34 yrs of age for recurrent neurotic depressions, inhibited assertiveness, and frigidity. In the 13 yrs since termination of a satisfactory 71/2-yr analysis, the S eschewed all contact except for 6 letters. The 1st 4 were spontaneous: a brief note enclosed with final payment and 3 lengthy (1,700-2,000 words) communications at 8 mo, 6 yrs, and 10 yrs posttreatment. They described significant psychological advances through extensive working through, with no detectable plea for help, and after the fact. To each, the analyst replied with satisfaction in her progress and appreciation for the follow-up. The 5th and 6th letters were brief responses to letters from the analyst. Working through of superego and exhibitionistic conflicts appeared to have furthered integration of the split positive and negative self-representations. These communications provide detailed longitudinal samplings of development apparently made possible by the therapeutic effects of S's analysis. In view of early severe maternal deprivation and identification with a depressed mother, consolidation of the new partial identification with the analyst subsequent to termination was a prolonged process.

213,Activation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory system in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with Borderline Personality Disorder,"Daz, Mars","A case-control study including patients (n = 20) with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and healthy controls (n = 33) was carried out. To avoid interferences of other clinical conditions on biological findings, patients were free of current major depressive episodes or substance dependence disorders, and had no life history of schizophrenia, bipolar or neuropsychiatric disorders. Patients were free of medication for at least two weeks at the time of the study. Studies carried out in peripheral mononuclear blood cells and plasma evidence a systemic inflammatory condition in unstable-impulsive BPD patients. Specifically, a significant increase in some intracellular components of two main pro-inflammatory pathways such as iNOS and COX-2, as well as an increase in the plasma levels of the inflammatory cytokine IL1$\beta$. Interestingly, patients have an increase in the protein expression of the anti-inflammatory subtype of nicotinic receptor $\alpha$7nAChR. This finding may reflect a possible mechanism trying to maintain intracellular inflammation pathways under control. All together, these results describe an imbalanced, pro-inflammatory and oxidant phenotype in BPD patients independent of plasma cotinine levels. Although more scientific evidence is needed, the determination of multiple components of pro- and anti-inflammatory cellular pathways have interesting potential as biological markers for BPD and other generalized impulsive syndromes, specially data obtained with $\alpha$7nAChR and its lack of correlation with plasma levels of nicotine metabolites. Their pharmacological modulation with receptor modulators can be a promising therapeutic target to take into account in mental health conditions associated with inflammatory or oxido/nitrosative consequences. Also, identifying at-risk individuals would be of importance for early detection and intervention in adolescent subjects before they present severe behavioural problems. \textcopyright 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2012.0,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2012.09.009,CJXCJR7B,0,cognitive_additional,214

215,A systematic review of online youth mental health promotion and prevention interventions.,"Clarke, Aleisha M.; Kuosmanen, Tuuli; Barry, Margaret M.","The rapid growth in the use of online technologies among youth provides an opportunity to increase access to evidence-based mental health resources. The aim of this systematic review is to provide a narrative synthesis of the evidence on the effectiveness of online mental health promotion and prevention interventions for youth aged 12-25 years. Searching a range of electronic databases, 28 studies conducted since 2000 were identified. Eight studies evaluating six mental health promotion interventions and 20 studies evaluating 15 prevention interventions were reviewed. The results from the mental health promotion interventions indicate that there is some evidence that skills-based interventions presented in a module-based format can have a significant impact on adolescent mental health, however, an insufficient number of studies limits this finding. The results from the online prevention interventions indicate the significant positive effect of computerized cognitive behavioral therapy on adolescents' and emerging adults' anxiety and depression symptoms. The rates of non-completion were moderate to high across a number of studies. Implementation findings provide some evidence that participant face-to-face and/or web-based support was an important feature in terms of program completion and outcomes. Additional research examining factors affecting exposure, adherence and outcomes is required. The quality of evidence across the studies varied significantly, thus highlighting the need for more rigorous, higher quality evaluations conducted with more diverse samples of youth. Although future research is warranted, this study highlights the potential of online mental health promotion and prevention interventions in promoting youth wellbeing and reducing mental health problems.

216,The effects of oxytocin on social cognition in borderline personality disorder,"Servan, A.; Brunelin, J.; Poulet, E.","INTRODUCTION: Deficits in social cognition and interpersonal difficulties are key features in borderline personality disorder. Social cognition refers to the function of perceiving and adequately dealing with social signals, leading to the establishment and maintenance of healthy and positive social relationships. Evidence suggests that oxytocin (OT) may improve social cognition and human social behavior. Recently, several studies have highlighted the beneficial effects of oxytocin in several psychiatric conditions involving social cognition deficits such as schizophrenia, autism or social phobia. However, despite growing interest, the effects of oxytocin in patients with borderline personality disorder are far from being clearly demonstrated. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to review and discuss studies investigating the interest of oxytocin in alleviating social cognition deficits in patients with borderline personality disorder (recognition of emotion, trust and cooperation, affective and cognitive empathy, emotional expression and social problem-solving). METHOD: A systematic review of the literature was conducted up to September 31, 2016 on the Pubmed, Science direct, Medline and Scopus databases using ""borderline personality disorder"" and ""oxytocin"" as keywords. To be included, studies were to include patients with borderline personality disorder; to investigate social cognition and to investigate the effect of oxytocin on social cognition in patients with TPB. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 52 articles. Among them, 11 studies were selected according to the PRISMA criteria. The effect of oxytocin on social cognition in patients with borderline personality disorder was mainly investigated in relation to recognition of emotions and trust and cooperation. We did not find any studies investigating the effect of oxytocin on affective and cognitive empathy, emotional expression or social problem-solving abilities. In patients with borderline personality disorder, oxytocin had a beneficial impact on recognition and discrimination of emotions and on hypervigilance towards social threats. However, oxytocin could hinder trust and cooperation. CONCLUSIONS: These data lead us to consider oxytocin as a treatment for emotion recognition deficit and hypervigilance towards social threats in borderline personality disorder. A beneficial effect of oxytocin of this nature may be obtained only in patients without deficits in trust and cooperation because of a risk of aggravating relational instability. There was no current evidence for the interest of oxytocin in enhancing affective and cognitive empathy in borderline personality disorder. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical interest of combining oxytocin with psychotherapeutic approaches such as dialectical behavioral therapy or mentalisation-based treatment.",2018.0,10.1016/j.encep.2017.11.001,WTAIE2Z5,0,additional,217
217,Psychiatric comorbidities associated with a positive screening using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test in subjects with severe alcohol use disorder,"D'Hondt, F.; Lescut, C.; Maurage, P.; Menard, O.; Gibour, B.; Cottencin, O.; Montegue, S.; Jardri, R.; Rolland, B.","BACKGROUND: Patients with severe alcohol use disorder (SAUD) frequently show cognitive deficits that can be efficiently identified using screening tools such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test. These cognitive deficits, which reduce the efficacy of therapeutic interventions and may contribute to dropout and relapse, could be, however, partly due to a treatable other cause. Accordingly, this exploratory study examined whether psychiatric comorbid disorders can induce a positive MoCA screening among recently detoxified SAUD subjects. METHODS: One hundred recently detoxified patients with SAUD were divided into two groups according to whether they presented cognitive deficits using the MoCA. Groups were compared for demographic data, SAUD severity, impulsivity, and psychiatric comorbidities. The significant parameters were then introduced in a logistic regression model to establish their relative contributions in a positive MoCA status in SAUD subjects. RESULTS: Among the significant parameters revealed by the bivariable analyses, agoraphobia and current depressive episode were found to be significant predictors of the MoCA status in the multivariable comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: A positive MoCA screening for cognitive impairments among post-detoxification SAUD patients could also be related to comorbid agoraphobia and depressive episode rather than to SAUD itself. A comprehensive psychiatric assessment must be performed in SAUD patients so that other potential causes of cognitive deficits, in particular with regard to mood and anxiety disorders, can be identified and treated.",2018.0,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2018.07.009,C54LGF8A,0,additional,218

219,A sense of entitlement to self in relationships: An elaboration of attachment and feminist object relations theories.,"Wolfe, Suzanne Elaine","Many women who present for psychotherapy with symptoms of depression and/or anxiety describe a common pattern of involvement in current and past nonmutual relationships. This phenomenon is described and explored in light of a new conception of entitlement. It is proposed that one's sense of entitlement is a relative relational position along a continuum from overentitlement through healthy entitlement to underentitlement, and that these women are often underentitled in their adult relationships. Their relationships are often with overentitled others, and they may hold internal convictions that their place in relationships is to be underentitled. A particular pattern contributing to underentitlement in adult women may be a history of mother-daughter role reversal, in which the caregiving function was inverted. Selected research from attachment theory is presented that applies to the hypothesis that one's sense of entitlement as an adult is related to relational expectations learned very early in life and internalized in working models of relationships, originating especially from the relationship with mother. Evidence is offered to demonstrate that these working models carry forward, affecting later social and cognitive development, and also mothering styles in adulthood. The feminist object relations perspectives of Chodorow (1989) and Eichenbaum and Orbach (1983) that suggest mother-daughter role reversals and underdeveloped identity in the daughter, which may occur as a result of their shared gender, is discussed. Therapeutic provisions that address underentitlement and alter these women's internal expectation of underentitlement are suggested. Because one's working model regarding entitlement, like all working models, is learned and confirmed in relationships, changing the sense of entitlement hinges upon a different, disconfirming relational experience. Some relational experiences not provided (or insufficiently provided) in early attachment relationships will need to occur in treatment, in order for the person to more fully grow into selfhood and healthy, mutual relationships with others. The importance of therapists' healthy sense of entitlement is discussed. The implications of therapists' entitlement-related training experiences are considered. Finally, areas for future research related to entitlement are identified. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",1998.0,,7YPVA29W,0,psychodynamic,220
220,Stress and psychotic transition: A literature review,"Chaumette, B.; Kebir, O. and","Background Psychiatric disorders are consistent with the gene x environment model, and non-specific environmental factors such as childhood trauma, urbanity, and migration have been implicated. All of these factors have in common to dysregulate the biological pathways involved in response to stress. Stress is a well-known precipitating factor implicated in psychiatric disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and possibly schizophrenia. More precisely, psychosocial stress induces dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) and could modify neurotransmission, which raises the question of the involvement of stress-related biological changes in psychotic disorders. Indeed, the literature reveals dysregulation of the HPA axis in schizophrenia. This dysregulation seems to be present in the prodromal phases (UHR subjects for ultra-high risk) and early schizophrenia (FEP for first episode psychosis). Thus, and following the stress–vulnerability model, stress could act directly on psychotic onset and precipitate the transition of vulnerable subjects to a full-blown psychosis. Objective The present paper reviews the literature on stress and onset of schizophrenia, with consideration for the causal role vs. associated role of HPA axis dysregulation in schizophrenia and the factors that influence it, in particular during prodromal and earlier phases. We also discuss different methods developed to measure stress in humans. Methodology We performed a bibliographic search using the keywords ‘cortisol', ‘glucocorticoid', ‘HPA' with ‘UHR', ‘CHR', ‘at-risk mental state', ‘first episode psychosis', ‘schizotypal', ‘prodromal schizophrenia' in Medline, Web of Knowledge (WOS), and EBSCO completed by a screening of the references of the selected articles. Results Stress has been studied for many years in schizophrenia, either by subjective methods (questionnaires), or objective methods (standardized experimental protocols) with biological sampling and/or brain imaging methods. These methods have suggested a link between dysregulation of the HPA axis and psychotic symptoms both through abnormal basal levels of cortisol and flattened reactivity to social stress. Imaging results suggest indirect modifications, including abnormal pituitary or hippocampal volume. Several factors dysregulating the HPA axis have also been highlighted, such as consumption of drugs (i.e. cannabis), childhood trauma or genetic factors (such as COMT, or MTHFR variants). Psychological stress induces subcortical dopaminergic activation attributable to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation. This dysregulation is present in the prodromal phase (UHR) in patients who have experienced a first psychotic episode (FEP) and in siblings of schizophrenic patients. Stress dysregulation is a plausible hypothesis to understand the psychosis onset. Discussion The effect of stress on brain pathways could participate to the mechanisms underlying the onset of psychotic symptoms, both as a precipitating factor and as a marker of a predisposing vulnerability. This dysregulation fits into the gene x environment model: in subjects with genetic predispositions, stressful environmental factors can modify biological pathways implicated in psychiatric disorders, promoting the emergence of symptoms. However, many confounding factors obscure the literature, and further studies are needed in schizophrenic patients, UHR and FEP patients to clarify the precise role of stress in psychotic transition. Identification of stress biomarkers could help diagnosis and prognosis, and pave the way for specific care strategies based on stress-targeted therapies.",2016.0,10.1016/j.encep.2015.10.001,Y5ANZUNM,0,diathesis,221
221,Aberrant seasonal variations of platelet serotonin uptake in endogenous depression.,"Malmgren, R.; Aberg-Wistedt, A.; Martensson, B.","The serotonin uptake in platelets of 120 healthy volunteers and 64 endogenously depressed patients was investigated over a 2-year period. In healthy individuals, Km exhibited a significant seasonal rhythm during the bright half of the year. The seasonal rhythm of Vmax assumes the form of a sine curve, with nadir values at the vernal and autumn equinoxes and peak values at the winter and summer solstices. Km in patients was higher than in controls in February and October, and the seasonal variation of Km differed between patients and controls. The monthly mean values of Vmax in patients were, as a rule, lower than corresponding values in controls, but significantly so only in December. Patients had higher Vmax than controls in October and November, and the seasonal variation of Vmax in patients differed from that of controls. The results suggest that Km, a measure of the affinity of the serotonin uptake site, may be subject to photoperiodic regulation in healthy individuals. The annual variation in uptake site densities, as judged by the changes in Vmax, are probably generated by an endogenous superior oscillator. The aberrant uptake kinetics found in the endogenously depressed patients may reflect seasonal susceptibility to the disorder and/or altered serotonergic rhythmicity.",1989.0,,3ZCZENGG,0,cognitive_additional,222
222,Depression treatment and maternal functioning,"Logsdon, M. C.; Wisner, K.; Sit, D.; Luther, J. F.; Wisniewski, S. R.","Background: In women with major depressive disorder (MDD), maternal role functioning is negatively impacted but has been shown to improve with treatment; however, most investigations have not included a control group or studied women longitudinally. We hypothesized that women with MDD who responded to serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) would have overall functioning and maternal role functioning scores similar to that of the control group and superior to women with MDD (either untreated or nonresponsive to SSRIs). Methods: This prospective, longitudinal observational study (n = 215) included postpartum assessments at 2 1/2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. Postpartum women were categorized into four mutually exclusive exposure groups by depression and medication status: (1) Control group (no SSRI, no MDD; (2) Responder (SSRI, no MDD); (3) Untreated (MDD, no SSRI); and (4) Nonresponder (Both MDD and SSRI). Outcome variables include a measure of overall functioning (Global Assessment Scale, GAS) and three measures of maternal role functioning (Maternal Self Efficacy, ICS; Gratification in Maternal Role, GRAT; and overall maternal role functioning, IFSAC). Results: The study hypothesis was supported. Responders had scores related to overall functioning and maternal role functioning that were similar to the control group and superior to nonresponders and untreated women with MDD, as measured by the GAS and the GRAT. Conclusion: Postpartum depression treatment optimally targets both symptom improvement and maternal functional recovery. The GRAT is a simple, self-administered instrument that can be used with a depression measure to assess maternal role functioning.

This increased slope is interpreted to reflect enhanced HCO3- movement from blood to CSF at high arterial [HCO3-].

N.","OBJECTIVE: Although enuresis is relatively common in early childhood, research exploring its antecedents and implications is surprisingly limited, perhaps because the condition typically remits in middle childhood. METHOD: We examined the prevalence, predictors, prognostic factors, and outcomes of primary enuresis in a large (N = 559) multi-method, multi-informant prospective study with a community-based sample of children followed from age 3 years to age 9 years. RESULTS: We found that 12.7% of our sample met criteria for lifetime enuresis, suggesting that it is a commonly occurring childhood disorder. Males were more than twice as likely as females to have a lifetime diagnosis. Significant age 3 predictors of developing primary enuresis by age 9 included child anxiety and low positive affectivity, maternal history of anxiety, and low authoritative parenting. In addition, poorer global functioning and more depressive and anxiety symptoms at age 3 years predicted a greater likelihood of persistence through age 9. By age 9 years, 77% of children who had received a diagnosis of primary enuresis were in remission and continent. However, children who had remitted exhibited a higher rate of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and greater ADHD and depressive symptoms at age 9 compared to children with no lifetime history of enuresis. CONCLUSION: Results of the present study underscore the clinical significance of primary enuresis and demonstrate that it shows both strong antecedent and prospective associations with psychopathology.

228,Closing the Gap Between Cognitive Performance and Real-World Functional Outcome in Schizophrenia: The Importance of Metacognition.,"Koren, Danny; Harvey, Philip D.","Functional outcome in schizophrenia has received increased attention in recent years, as the knowledge that cognitive functioning is a major determinant of outcome has become widely accepted. While impaired cognitive functioning is the most consistent predictor of functional deficits in schizophrenia, the overlap is far from complete and cognition accounts for at most 50 \% of the variance in functional outcome. In this paper, we review the research on factors other than cognition that relate to functional skills deficits in schizophrenia and focus on several potential moderators between cognition and functional outcome. These factors include various affective and societal variables, as well as metacognition. Metacognitive processes include the ability to appraise the accuracy of one's knowledge and competence and to use these appraisals to adjust real-world behaviors accordingly. Metacognition is related to, but separate from social cognition as well as from formal, base-level cognitive test performance. An example of metacognitive process is the ability to monitor the limits of personal knowledge base, and seek assistance in situations where requisite information or skills are lacking. Being able to perform these monitoring and control operations can allow for suitable functional performance despite cognitive limitations. Conversely, failing to perform these operations can account for poor functional outcome despite intact cognitive abilities. We argue that metacognition is an important moderator between cognition and real-world function and that this factor, in contrast to societal variables, may be modifiable in individual patients with schizophrenia.

229,Predicting mortality of residents at admission to nursing home: a longitudinal cohort study.,"Hjaltadottir, Ingibjorg; Hallberg, Ingalill Rahm; Ekwall, Anna Kristensson; Nyberg, Per","BACKGROUND: An increasing numbers of deaths occur in nursing homes. Knowledge of the course of development over the years in death rates and predictors of mortality is important for officials responsible for organizing care to be able to ensure that staff is knowledgeable in the areas of care needed. The aim of this study was to investigate the time from residents' admission to Icelandic nursing homes to death and the predictive power of demographic variables, health status (health stability, pain, depression and cognitive performance) and functional profile (ADL and social engagement) for 3-year mortality in yearly cohorts from 1996-2006. METHODS: The samples consisted of residents (N = 2206) admitted to nursing homes in Iceland in 1996-2006, who were assessed once at baseline with a Minimum Data Set (MDS) within 90 days of their admittance to the nursing home. The follow-up time for survival of each cohort was 36 months from admission. Based on Kaplan-Meier analysis (log rank test) and non-parametric correlation analyses (Spearman's rho), variables associated with survival time with a p-value \textless 0.05 were entered into a multivariate Cox regression model. RESULTS: The median survival time was 31 months, and no significant difference was detected in the mortality rate between cohorts. Age, gender (HR 1.52), place admitted from (HR 1.27), ADL functioning (HR 1.33-1.80), health stability (HR 1.61-16.12) and ability to engage in social activities (HR 1.51-1.65) were significant predictors of mortality. A total of 28.8 \% of residents died within a year, 43.4 \% within two years and 53.1 \% of the residents died within 3 years. CONCLUSION: It is noteworthy that despite financial constraints, the mortality rate did not change over the study period. Health stability was a strong predictor of mortality, in addition to ADL performance. Considering these variables is thus valuable when deciding on the type of service an elderly person needs. The mortality rate showed that more than 50 \% died within 3 years, and almost a third of the residents may have needed palliative care within a year of admission. Considering the short survival time from admission, it seems relevant that staff is trained in providing palliative care as much as restorative care.",2011.0,10.1186/1472-6963-11-86,TIAPBF37,0,cognitive,230
230,Comparative study of personality traits in patients with bipolar I and II disorder from the five-factor model perspective,"Kim, B.; Lim, J. H.; Kim, S. Y.; Joo, Y. H.","Objective: The distinguishing features of Bipolar I Disorder (BD I) from Bipolar II Disorder (BD II) may reflect a separation in enduring trait dimension between the two subtypes. We therefore assessed the similarities and differences in personality traits in patients with BD I and BD II from the perspective of the Five-Factor Model (FFM). Methods: The revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) was administered to 85 BD I (47 females, 38 males) and 43 BD II (23 females, 20 males) patients. All included patients were in remission from their most recent episode and in a euthymic state for at least 8 weeks prior to study entry. Results: BDII patients scored higher than BD I patients on the Neuroticism dimension and its four corresponding facets (Anxiety, Depression, Self-consciousness, and Vulnerability). In contrast, BD II patients scored lower than BD I patients on the Extraversion dimension and its facet, Positive emotion. Competence and Achievement-striving facets within the Conscientiousness dimension were significantly lower for BD II than for BD I patients. There were no significant between-group differences in the Openness and Agreeableness dimensions. Conclusion: Disparities in personality traits were observed between BD I and BD II patients from the FFM perspective. BD II patients had higher Neuroticism and lower Extraversion than BD I patients, which are differentiating natures between the two subtypes based on the FFM. \ \textcopyright \ 2012 Korean Neuropsychiatric Association.",2012.0,,QG2S79RM,0,personality,231
231,Effects of the menstrual cycle on measures of personality in women with premenstrual syndrome: A preliminary study,"Berlin, R. E.; Raju, J. D.; Schmidt, P. J.; Adams, L. F.; Rubinow, D. R.","Background: Previous studies suggest that women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) differ from those without PMS in measures of personality. The purpose of this study was to measure the effect of menstrual cycle phase on personality variables in women with and without PMS. Method: The Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-Revised (PDQ-R) was administered in both the follicular and luteal phases to women with PMS (according to National Institute of Mental Health PMS Workshop Diagnostic Guidelines) (N = 40). An asymptomatic control group (N = 20) as well as a symptomatic group of women with DSM-IV-diagnosed recurrent, non-menstrual-cycle-related brief depression (N = 20) also completed the questionnaire in both phases. Results: Only women with PMS demonstrated a significant increase in total PDQ-R score (reflecting overall personality disorder) from the follicular to the luteal phase (p \textless .01). Women with PMS had significantly higher total PDQ-R scores than the asymptomatic controls during both the follicular (p \textless .05) and luteal (p \textless .01) phases, whereas there was no significant difference between women with PMS and symptomatic controls during either phase. Subscale scores fit similar patterns, as did the number of women in each group meeting a cutoff score indicative of the presence of personality dysfunction. Conclusion: In this preliminary study, women with PMS were unique in demonstrating a menstrual cycle phase effect on PDQ-R score, while their scores in both phases were closer to symptomatic controls than asymptomatic controls. These findings suggest that personality disorder in women with PMS may have both state- and trait-related components.",2001.0,,4M2HHL75,0,cognitive_additional,232

M.; Kubiak, S.; Zlotnick, C.; Johnson, J. E.","OBJECTIVE: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is highly prevalent among incarcerated populations; however, research has yet to examine whether prisoners diagnosed with BPD experience greater interpersonal dysfunction and institutional misconduct while incarcerated. PROCEDURE: This study drew from a sample of 184 male and female prisoners diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) in a randomized trial of depression treatment. The presence of a BPD diagnosis (n=69) was analyzed as a predictor of disciplinary incidents/infractions (i.e., fights, arguments with staff, disciplinary infractions, isolation), time spent in isolation, and types of aggression and victimization experiences during incarceration. RESULTS: There was a trend suggesting prisoners with BPD were about twice as likely as those without BPD to report disciplinary incidents/infractions (OR=1.76 [0.93, 3.32], p=0.075). Having a BPD diagnosis was unrelated to time in isolation and overall aggression and victimization. However, prisoners with BPD were more likely than those without BPD to perpetrate and be victimized by psychological aggression. Due to high rates of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) in the sample as a whole (72%), additional analyses compared outcomes across prisoners with no BPD or ASPD diagnosis, BPD diagnosis only, ASPD diagnosis only, and comorbid BPD and ASPD. Prisoners with comorbid BPD and ASPD were no more likely than prisoners with ASPD only to report disciplinary incidents/infractions, but were significantly more likely than those with ASPD only to report perpetrating and being victimized by psychological aggression. CONCLUSIONS: Among prisoners with MDD, those with a BPD diagnosis have increased risk of psychological aggression and disciplinary infractions during incarceration.",2018.0,10.1016/j.comppsych.2018.03.007,GN4ZVPLX,0,additional,233

234,"Prognostic value of depressive symptoms on mortality, morbidity and nursing home admission in older people.","Miu, Doris K. Y.; Chan, Carol K. M.","AIM: Depression is frequently encountered in hospitalized elderly persons. Studies have found an independent association between depressive symptoms, mortality and functional decline. Only a few studies look specifically at other potential effects of depressive symptoms, such as subsequent hospital readmission or nursing home admission. In this study, we aim to investigate the association between the presence of depressive symptoms and nursing home placement, hospital admission and mortality in a group of geriatric outpatients receiving rehabilitation. METHODS: All community dwelling elderly patients with no history of depression or cognitive impairment who were new attendances of a geriatric day hospital of a regional hospital in Hong Kong were recruited. Baseline demographic data, medical comorbidities, functional status and presence of depressive symptoms defined as a Geriatric Depression Scale score of more than 8 were recorded. Outcome variables were mortality, nursing home admission and unplanned hospital admission rate at 1 year. RESULTS: Two hundred and nine subjects were included with a mean age of 77.4 years (standard deviation, 7.6). There was no statistically significant difference on mortality at 1 year and nursing home admission. However, depressed subjects were found to have increased risk of hospital admission (odds ratio = 2.67, 95 \% confidence interval = 1.31, 5.32) and have more episodes of unplanned hospital admission (odds ratio = 1.52, 95 \% confidence interval = 1.1, 2.12). CONCLUSION: Elderly patients with depressive symptoms are associated with increased risk of hospital admission and greater inpatient service utilization, independent of their functional status. These results emphasize the need to improve the management of depressive symptoms and heighten the recognition and treatment of depression in the elderly population.",2011.0,10.1111/j.1447-0594.2010.00665.x,QGJDFM3I,0,cognitive,235
235,"Linear skin atrophy, scarring alopecia, anonychia, and tongue lesion: a new syndrome?","Sequeiros, J.; Sack, G. H., Jr.","One of a pair of female monozygotic twins showed skin atrophy with linear alternation of depressed scarlike areas and intervening ridges of normal or nearly normal skin. She was born with friable skin and a vesicular-bullous eruption which was followed by gradual scabbing. Hypohidrosis in the affected areas, heat intolerance, and febrile convulsions were noted in infancy and childhood. No new skin lesions developed, and the existing ones, the sweating disturbance, and the heat intolerance gradually improved with time. Scarring alopecia, congenital absence of three toenails, and a scarlike lesion of the tongue were also present. Their absence in the other twin supports the view that 1) these manifestations all are part of the same syndrome, and 2) this syndrome is nongenetic. Histologically, there were no diagnostic or consistent findings, but the number of skin appendages was diminished, and the elastic fibers were reduced in number and size in one biopsy. The calculated probability for the twins being monozygotic was 0.9998. This family was also remarkable for the presence of alopecia areata in three successive generations with only one instance of apparent nonpenetrance. We conclude that this may represent a previously undescribed syndrome of congenital fragility of connective tissue which predisposed to damage of the elastica, possibly caused by an early inflammatory phase.",1985.0,10.1002/ajmg.1320210408,4VQNEUY3,0,cognitive,236
236,Determinants of speech-hearing disability in King-Kopetzky Syndrome.,"Zhao, Fei; Stephens, Dafydd","Explored the degrees of speech-hearing disability in 109 patients (aged 11-69 yrs) with King-Kopetzky syndrome using the Social Hearing Handicap Index (SHHI) and investigated the relationships between the SHHI scores and possible predictive physiological, psychoacoustical, and psychological factors. The Crown Crisp Experiential Index (CCEI) was also administered. Results suggest that the Ss experience pronounced speech-hearing disabilities and that the effects of personality factors can influence speech-hearing disability to a certain degree. On the CCEI, some subscales of anxiety, phobic anxiety, obsessionality, somatic anxiety, and depression were significantly correlated with SHHI scores. Two variables, somatic anxiety and the performance of the sentence in noise test, were the significant predictors of SHHI scores and appear to be the main determinants of speech-hearing disability in King-Kopetzky syndrome.

M.","The early identification of likely remitters and non-remitters to pharmacotherapy for panic disorder may have important implications for clinical treatment decisions. To address this question, combined data from two fixed-dose and two flexible dose placebo-controlled studies of sertraline treatment of panic disorder were examined. Patients (N=544) diagnosed with panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, were treated with 50 mg of sertraline, 100 mg of sertraline, flexible dosages of sertraline, or placebo. Measures of early improvement included panic attack frequency (full+limited symptom attacks), anticipatory anxiety, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), and the Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-I) Scale. Improvement as reflected in CGI-I ratings and change from baseline in the HAM-A at weeks 1, 2, and 3 significantly (P \textless 0.0001) predicted endpoint clinical remission (defined at endpoint as no full panic attacks and a CGI-Severity rating of 1 or 2). Improvements in panic attack frequency and anticipatory anxiety were not consistent predictors in multivariate predictive models. Receiver-Operator Curve analyses revealed good specificity (0.83) for change in CGI-I at week 2, and good sensitivity (0.82) for change in HAM-A at week 3. Predictive success for HAM-A and CGI-I was not significantly different for fixed vs. flexible dose sertraline treatment, nor for sertraline vs. placebo treatment. The use of ROC analyses for examination of early response as a predictor of final remission holds promise for aiding clinicians in decision making regarding the need for alternative or supplemental treatment approaches during the course of pharmacotherapy for panic disorder. \textcopyright 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

239,Still stressed but feeling better: Well-being in autism spectrum disorder families as children become adults,"Pozo, P.; Sarri","The transition to adulthood and adulthood itself have been identified as times of stress for parents of individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Longitudinal studies, however, show improvements in the well-being of mothers of adolescents and young adults with autism spectrum disorder. This article presents a cross-sectional study of 102 Spanish parents (51 mothers and 51 fathers) of 102 individuals with autism spectrum disorder. The aim was to examine parental well-being (evaluated based on stress, anxiety, depression and psychological well-being) in three groups of parents of adults, adolescents and young children with autism spectrum disorder. In addition, the relationships between parental well-being and the characteristics of their children, social support, parental age and sense of coherence were analysed. The results showed that although parental stress and psychological well-being levels were similar across the groups, depression and anxiety were lower in parents of adolescents or adults compared with parents of young children. Different factors predicted different measures of parental well-being, but sense of coherence emerged as the main predictive factor for all parental well-being measures. These findings are discussed in relation to parental adaptation over the lifespan and the implications for interventions in autism spectrum disorder families.",2015.0,10.1177/1362361315583191,AL573WR3,0,diathesis,240

M.; Crane, Natania A.; Hedeker, Donald; Mermelstein, Robin J.","BACKGROUND: Marijuana use is increasingly widespread among adolescents and young adults; however, few studies have examined longitudinal trajectories of marijuana use during this important developmental period. As such, we examined adolescent trajectories of marijuana use and the psychosocial factors that may differentiate individuals who escalate their marijuana use over adolescence and young adulthood from those who do not. METHODS: Participants were 1204 9th and 10th graders at baseline who were over-sampled for cigarette use and were followed over 6-years, as part of an extensive longitudinal study, the Social and Emotional Contexts of Adolescent Smoking Patterns (SECASP) study. Growth Mixture Modeling (GMM) was used to model trajectories of marijuana use and Mixed Effects Regression analyses were used to examine psychosocial correlates of marijuana use escalation over time. RESULTS: Our results revealed three trajectories of non-escalating users (low users, medium users, and high users) and one escalating user trajectory. We found that relative to Non-escalators the Escalators had higher cigarette smoking (p \ \textless \ .0001), novelty-seeking (p=.02), aggressive and anti-social behavior (p \ \textless \ .007), and problem behavior related to peer context (p=.04). Moreover, there were important time and Group by Time interactions in some of these relationships. On the other hand, parental control and depression did not differ between escalators and low and medium non-escalating users. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking, novelty-seeking, aggressive and anti-social behavior, and peer influence are related to 'escalating' marijuana use throughout adolescence and young adulthood.",2015.0,10.1016/j.addbeh.2015.02.008,6S838IJS,0,personality,241

However, in late-life depression there is little evidence of a longitudinal change in rCBF through remission. We examined whether the decreased rCBF in individuals with late-life depression resolves following treatment. METHODS: Twenty-five depressed patients older than 55 years completed the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and single photon emission computed tomography before and after a mean of 13.7 weeks of pharmacotherapy. Quantitative analyses were performed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping procedure. RESULTS: Patients with depression demonstrated decreased rCBF in the anterior ventral and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), including anterior cingulate cortices, bilateral ventrolateral PFC to temporal cortices, and bilateral medial to lateral parieto-occipital lobes relative to healthy controls. No particular areas showed increased rCBF. Following pharmacotherapy, rCBF significantly increased in the left dorsolateral PFC to precentral areas and the right parieto-occipital regions. However, decreased rCBF at baseline in the anterior ventral/dorsal medial PFC, bilateral ventrolateral PFC, bilateral temporal lobes, and bilateral parietal lobes did not show significant improvement after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Remarkable improvements in rCBF in the left dorsolateral PFC to precentral regions are consistent with the hypothesis that neuronetworks including the left frontal cortex may be functionally and reversibly involved in late-life unipolar major depression (state-dependent). In contrast, neural circuits including bilateral medial, dorsolateral, and parietal areas may reflect underlying and continuous pathognomonic brain dysfunction of depression (trait-dependent).",2008.0,10.1002/gps.1980,XSJEU5ZG,0,cognitive_additional,242

Method: This prospective cohort study examined 500 Veterans from Upstate New York at four time points, six months apart. TBI status was determined by a structured clinical interview. Neuropsychological instruments focused on attention, memory, and executive functions. Subjective cognitive complaints were assessed with the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI). A psychological distress composite included measures of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and generalized anxiety. Results: Forty-four percent of the sample was found to have sustained military-related TBI, 97% of which were classified as mild (mTBI), with a mean time since injury of 41 months. Veterans with TBI endorsed moderate cognitive symptoms on the NSI. In contrast to these subjective complaints, mean cognitive test performance was within normal limits at each time point in all domains, regardless of TBI status. Multilevel models examined effects of TBI status, time, and psychological distress. Psychological distress was a strong predictor of all cognitive domains, especially the subjective domain. Substantial proportions of both TBI+ and TBI- groups remained in the clinically significant range at the initial and final assessment for all three distress measures, but the TBI+ group had higher proportions of clinically significant cases. Conclusions: Objective cognitive performance was generally within normal limits for Veterans with mTBI across all assessments.

247,Fear of intimacy in women: relationship between attachment styles and depressive symptoms.,"Reis, Samantha; Grenyer, Brin F. S.","BACKGROUND: Preoccupied and fearful attachment have both been associated with depressive symptoms, but it is unclear which attachment style is primarily associated with major depression. While preoccupied attachment denotes a focus on relationships as a source of self-validation, fearful attachment involves an avoidance of relationships for fear of rejection. Present research aims to investigate the relative influence of fearful and preoccupied attachments on self-reported depressive symptoms within both a student and a clinical sample and to examine these associations separately for male and female participants. SAMPLING AND METHODS: All participants completed the Relationship Questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory. Study 1 assessed attachment ratings and self-reported severity of depression for 71 patients diagnosed with major depression. Study 2 similarly assessed 245 university students, and study 3 compared attachment ratings of the two samples. RESULTS: Both Pearson correlations and partial correlations were examined for both samples. Fearful attachment was associated with self-reported depression severity for females with depression, but attachment styles were unrelated to depression severity for males with depression (study 1). For female university students, both fearful and preoccupied attachment styles were significantly related to depression severity, but again there were no associations for male university students when partial correlations were utilised (study 2). Study 3 revealed significantly higher levels of fearful attachment for women with depression compared with female university students and no significant differences for males overall. CONCLUSIONS: For females, the avoidance of intimacy for fear of rejection was associated with a broad spectrum of depressive symptoms. Results highlight gender differences in depressive experiences, and have implications for research into the effects of fearful attachment on social support and the therapeutic alliance. Limitations to this study include the reliance on self-report measures of attachment and depression severity, the small number of male participants in the clinical sample, and the use of a cross-sectional rather than longitudinal design.",2004.0,10.1159/000082268,VEN6PCF7,0,psychodynamic,248

249,Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM),"Pujić, B.","Introduction: Cardiovascular diseases are a major cause of complications in pregnancy worldwide, and the number of patients who develop cardiac problems during pregnancy is increasing. About 0.2- 4% of population will develop some kind of cardiovascular disease. PPCM is a serious idiopathic myocardial disease, which typically presents as heart failure secondary to left ventricular dysfunction towards the end of pregnancy or the following months postpartum, when no other cause of heart failure can be found. The incidence of PPCM is noted to vary between studies due to sample size differences but trends towards 1:2500-4000 in the US, 1:1000 in South Africa, and 1:300 in Haiti, probably due to different cultural habits, races, social status. The etiology of PPCM is unknown, but viral myocarditis, autoimmune, and idiopathic causes may contribute, as maternal age, twin pregnancy, malnutrition, preeclampsia, Afro- American race. Some authors prefer pregnancy- induced hemodynamic stress or genetic cause. Various mechanisms have been investigated, including the hypothesis that unbalanced peripartum or postpartum oxidative stress triggers the proteolytic cleavage of the nursing hormone prolactin into a potent antiangiogenic, proapoptotic, and proinflammatory 16 kDa fragment. Symptoms and signs of PPCM are similar to those in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The syndrome is associated with a high morbidity and mortality, and diagnosis is often delayed. PPCM can lead to major complications, including severe heart failure, arrhythmias, thromboembolic events, and death. PPCM may present as fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, abdominal pain in association with hepatic congestion, palpitations, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, edema, embolic phenomena, chest pain, hemoptysis, cough, increased JVD, pulmonary rales, cardiomegaly, tachycardia, S3 gallop, or murmur of mitral regurgitation. Diagnosis: Diagnosis of an early disease might be a challenge because many healthy women experience dyspnea, orthopnea, persistent cough, fatigue, and pedal edema in the last month of pregnancy. The diagnosis of PPCM should be considered whenever women present with heart failure during the peripartum period and a thorough cardiac workup looking for alternate causes should be considered, including ECG, BNP, and echocardiography. Echocardiographic criteria for diagnosis include ejection fraction of less than 45%, M-mode fractional shortening less than 30%, or both, and end-diastolic dimension more than 2.7 cm/m.3,4. Severe mitral regurgitation, as a consequence of left ventricular dilatation is often present. Fortunately, the majority of women with this condition demonstrate a complete or partial recovery. The main problem is that many of these women desire to become pregnant again and are concerned for the safety of future pregnancies. Women with complete recovery have incidence of relapse in next pregnancy of 20%. In that group possibility of morbidity and mortality is lower than in group with persistent left ventricular disfunction. In that group incidence of relapse is about 50%, and morbidity and mortality rate is high in next pregnancy. The EURObservational Research Programme will allow a comparison of women from around the world, from different ethnic backgrounds, presenting with PPCM and will report on their month and 12 month outcomes. The study aims to include 1000 patients and follow them for 1 year. New centres volunteering to participate in the study will be welcomed. ANESTHETIC TREATMENT Principles of anesthetic management for these parturients should be similar to that for other types of severe cardiomyopathies; that is, rapid treatment, oxygen administration with a goal of maintaining arterial oxygen saturation 95% or greater, avoidance of myocardial depressants and cautious fluid management with judicious use of diuretics and vasodilatators. Hydralazine and furosemide are the drugs of choice prepartum, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and ARB's are the mainstay of treatment post-partum. Initial bol ses of furosemide should be 20-40 mg I. V. Metoprolol is also commonly used in these patients. In the treatment of acutely ill or highly symptomatic patients, intravenous preload and afterload reducing agents (nitroprusside, nitroglycerin) or inotropic agents in low output states (dobutamine, dopamine, milrinone) should be considered. Nitroglycerin can be started at 10-20 μg/min and titrated up to 200 μg/min to achieve a SBP between 90-110 mmHg. Persistently severe disease may necessitate a cardiac transplant or mechanical assist device as a bridge to transplantation. Anticoagulant therapy is often indicated due to increased risk of thromboembolic events. Anticoagulation with subcutaneous heparin (i.e., 5000 U heparin subcutaneously twice daily) should be strongly considered in this population. Warfarin should be avoided until the postpartum period. A high recovery rate (96 %) was observed in patients obtaining combination therapy with: • beta-blocker, • angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors • angiotensin-receptor-blockers (ARBs) • bromocriptine. Although there have been reports of bromocriptine associated myocardial infarctions, dosages of 2.5 mg twice daily for two weeks followed by 2.5 mg daily for four weeks have shown promise. ANESTHETIC MANAGEMENT General anesthesia (GA): controlled airway, use of TEE if needed and patient acceptance in the areas where the use of regional anesthesia is still rare. Either inhalational technique or total intravenous anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil can be used. Severe myocardial depression and cardiac arrest have been reported as a result of administration of general anesthesia to these patients. General anesthesia does not provide any degree of thromboprophylaxis as thrombotic cerebral infarct has been reported after general anesthesia for Cesarean section in a patient with peripartum cardiomyopathy. Epidural anesthesia for PPCM: The advantages of epidural anesthesia include relative hemodynamic stability and familiarity of most of anesthesiologist with technique. in combination with pulmonary artery monitoring, is the best anesthetic option for these patients. However, a “patchy” block may develop which may precipitate the need for conversion to general anesthesia under potentially hazardous conditions. CSE anesthesia for PPCM: provides rapid onset, is titratable, and has a definite end point. If the initial intrathecal dose of combined spinal-epidural is carefully titrated, hemodynamic stability may approach that of continuous spinal anesthesia. Continuous spinal anesthesia for PPCM: offer more hemodynamic stability compared with single dose spinal anesthesia for Cesarean section. Hemodynamic stability, similar to that of epidural anesthesia, has also been reported. continuous spinal anesthesia has a lower failure rate than epidural anesthesia and also provides for lower maternal and umbilical cord blood concentrations of local anesthetics. Continuous spinal anesthesia may be more rapidly and effectively titratable. The risk of PDPH is decreased with 24 hour use of continuous spinal catheter. Our anesthetic goal in patients with PPCM is to provide reliable, rapidly titratable, profound analgesia with minimal hemodynamic changes. Each of these criteria can be easily achieved with continuous spinal anesthesia and combined spinal-epidural anesthesia. These techniques should be considered an anesthetic option, and probably the option of choice, for patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy and other significant cardiac diseases, provided that the anesthesia personnel have sufficient experience with these techniques. Discussion: However, many women who survive a severe episode of PPCM will continue to have decreased cardiac function, as evidenced by dobutamine stress tests and echocardiographic studies, while others may continue to improve over time. An LV end-diastolic diameter of >60 mm and LVEF <30% predicts poor recovery of LV function.",2017.0,,T6W52ZWX,0,additional,250
250,Comparison of health outcomes among affiliated and lay disaster volunteers enrolled in the World Trade Center Health Registry.,"Debchoudhury, Indira; Welch, Alice E.; Fairclough, Monique A.; Cone, James E.; Brackbill, Robert M.; Stellman, Steven D.; Farfel, Mark R.","BACKGROUND: Volunteers (non-professional rescue/recovery workers) are universally present at man-made and natural disasters and share experiences and exposures with victims. Little is known of their disaster-related health outcomes. METHODS: We studied 4974 adult volunteers who completed the World Trade Center Health Registry 2006-07 survey to examine associations between volunteer type (affiliated vs. lay) and probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); new or worsening respiratory symptoms; post-9/11 first diagnosis of anxiety disorder, depression, and/or PTSD; and asthma or reactive airway dysfunction syndrome (RADS). Affiliated volunteers reported membership in a recognized organization. Lay volunteers reported no organizational affiliation and occupations unrelated to rescue/recovery work. Adjusted odds ratios (OR(adj)) were calculated using multinomial regression. RESULTS: Lay volunteers were more likely than affiliated volunteers to have been present in lower Manhattan, experience the dust cloud, horrific events and injury on 9/11 and subsequently to report unmet healthcare needs. They had greater odds of early post-9/11 mental health diagnosis (OR(adj) 1.6; 95 \% CI: 1.4-2.0) and asthma/RADS (1.8; 1.2-2.7), chronic PTSD (2.2; 1.7-2.8), late-onset PTSD (1.9; 1.5-2.5), and new or worsening lower respiratory symptoms (2.0; 1.8-2.4). CONCLUSIONS: Lay volunteers' poorer health outcomes reflect earlier, more intense exposure to and lack of protection from physical and psychological hazards. There is a need to limit volunteers' exposures during and after disasters, as well as to provide timely screening and health care post-disaster.",2011.0,10.1016/j.ypmed.2011.08.034,E4JIRD6X,0,cognitive_additional,251

Comparing individuals with traumatic and nontraumatic limb loss in the first year after amputation.,"Kratz, Anna L.; Williams, Rhonda M.; Turner, Aaron P.; Raichle, Katherine A.; Smith, Doug G.; http://orcid.org/Turner","Objective: To compare individuals with traumatic (TE) vs. nontraumatic (NTE) amputation etiology on pain, psychological, and social variables over the first 12 months postamputation, and to explore changes in mean levels of and correlations between these variables over time. Participants: There were 111 adults with newly acquired limb loss. Settings: A VA medical center and a Level I trauma hospital in a large metropolitan area. Main Outcome Measures: Characteristic Pain Severity, Pain Interference, Patient Health Questionnaire depression module, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist, Social Constraints Scale, Aversive Emotional Support Scale, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention single item Social Support measure, single item loneliness measure. Results: The NTE group was significantly older, had lower income, and had greater medical comorbidity, preamputation pain, and physical disability. The etiology groups did not differ significantly in mean levels of outcome variables except that the TE group reported greater aversive emotional support at 6 and 12 months. The TE group demonstrated a quadratic change in pain interference, with highest levels at 6 months and a linear increase in social constraints. Both etiology groups showed a linear increase in PTSD symptoms over time. Correlations between physical, psychological, and social distress were observed earlier in the year for the NTE group. Conclusion: Despite significant demographic and preamputation experience differences, few differences in outcomes emerged by etiology group in the first year after amputation. Findings suggest that the year after amputation may be a time of greater change for those with traumatic amputation compared to those with nontraumatic amputation.

252,The course of major depression in diabetes,"Lustman, P. J.; Griffith, L. S.; Freedland, K. E.; Clouse, R. E.","Conformational states of fibrinogen and fibrin monomer were studied by methods of differential and solvent-perturbation spectrophotometry and ultraviolet fluorescence at about neutral pH (6.5) and in the region of lower pH, 3.2 to 4.0. To prevent repolymerization of fibrin monomer at pH 6.5, urea was added in a non-denaturing concentration of 1.7 M. In the acid region specified, the immediate environment of tyrosine and tryptophan residues was found to be more polar and the accessibility to perturbants higher than at pH 6.5. Much more drastic changes of the same type occurred at pH less than 3 when denaturation of the protein takes place. The conformation of fibrinogen altered progressively upon lowering pH from 4.0 to 3.2. This acidity increase, practically, did not influence the conformation of fibrin monomer. Thus the tolerance of the latter to the appearance of the new positively changed groups seems to be comparably high. The bulk of the conformational changes subsequent upon neutralization of an acid fibrin monomer solution proceeds at a higher rate than the activation transition, i.e. the acquirement of a state of polymerization readiness by fibrin monomer molecules.",1997.0,,JL2BXWT6,0,behavior,253

Three hundred eighty-eight working individuals completed a baseline questionnaire regarding work stress, sleep, mood, health, and so forth. During a 2-year period, 15 subjects (7 women and 8 men) of the total sample were identified as burnout cases, as they were assessed and referred to treatment for clinical burnout. Questionnaire data from the baseline measurement were used as independent variables in a series of logistic regression analyses to predict clinical burnout. The results identified too little sleep ( \textless 6 h) as the main risk factor for burnout development, with adjustment for work demands, thoughts of work during leisure time, and sleep quality. The first two factors were significant predictors in earlier steps of the multivariate regression. The results indicate that insufficient sleep, preoccupation with thoughts of work during leisure time, and high work demands are risk factors for subsequent burnout.

254,Prediction of recurrence in recurrent depression: A 5.5-year prospective study,,"Depression is a disease with high recurrence rates. Identifying predictors of recurrence and their relative importance in patients with recurrent depression is important for a better understanding of the course of this disease. This type of knowledge can be used to optimize and tailor preventive strategies of recurrence. In this study, we examined predictors of recurrence over a 5.5-year follow-up period and quantified to which extent these predictors explained observed variation in recurrence. Method: Data from 172 remitted recurrently depressed patients over a 5.5-year follow-up period were used. Recurrence was assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Illness-, stress-, and coping-related factors were examined as predictors of recurrence. Multiple Cox regression analysis was used, and explained variation was assessed to quantify the relative importance of the predictors. Patients were recruited between February 2000 and September 2000. Results: Number of previous episodes and residual symptoms explained each 15 \% of the variation in recurrence, indicating a medium effect size. The final multivariate prediction model included: a higher number of previous episodes, more residual symptoms, and lower levels of positive refocusing (explained variation 29 \% , indicating a strong effect size). Conclusion: In our multivariate prediction model, the number of previous episodes, residual symptoms, and a specific coping style were predictors of recurrence over a 5.5-year follow-up period in remitted recurrently depressed patients. Preventive therapies should focus on these factors. Although a substantial part of variation in recurrence (29 \% ) was explained by these predictors, most of it remains unexplained. Consequently, recurrence remains a difficult to predict and only partially understood phenomenon.

In the present investigation, subjects indicated whether or not they experienced both pleasant and unpleasant intrusive thoughts, their frequency and a rating of how pleasant or unpleasant these thoughts were. They also completed self report ratings of depression, anxiety, obsessional ritualizing, and the PGI. Results of a regression analysis indicate that the best standardised questionnaire predictor of unpleasant intrusive thoughts is depression as rated on the BDI, and anxiety as rated on the BAI.

METHODS: Data were collected from a prospective clinical cohort study of 148 patients assessed after discharge home (mean time since injury = 15 weeks) and one year later. At follow-up, attainment of life goals (set at baseline) and satisfaction with attainment was scored (10-point scale) and patients were asked how they adjusted unattained goals. Emotional distress was measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), quality of life with the Life Satisfaction Questionnaire (LiSat-9), self-efficacy with the TBI Self-efficacy Questionnaire (SEsx) and tenacity and flexibility with the Assimilative/Accommodative Coping Questionnaire (AACQ). Random effects regression analyses and structural equation modelling were used. RESULTS: In total, only 13 \% of initial life goals were achieved in one year. Patients who maintained efforts to reach their original goals had higher average levels of tenacity, but did not differ in level of self-efficacy compared with patients that disengaged. Patients with higher self-efficacy were more successful in attaining important life goals, which correlated with higher quality of life. Patients with higher self-efficacy, higher tenacity in goal pursuit, and higher flexibility in goal adjustment were less emotionally distressed, again correlating with higher quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: To optimise adaptation it seems appropriate to promote self-efficacy and both tenacity and flexibility during rehabilitation treatment.",2015.0,10.1177/0269215514549484,9A8Q2K67,0,behavior,258

Current pharmacotherapeutic options for GAD are in some cases only modestly effective, and may elicit undesirable side effects. Through targeted actions on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) pathway, the South Pacific medicinal plant kava (Piper methysticum) is a non-addictive, non-hypnotic anxiolytic with the potential to treat GAD. The evidence for the efficacy of kava for treating anxiety has been affirmed through clinical trials and meta-analyses. Recent research has also served to lessen safety concerns regarding the use of kava due to hepatotoxic risk, which is reflected in a recent German court overturning the previous kava ban in that country (which may in turn influence a reinstatement by the European Union). The aim of current research is to assess the efficacy of an 'aqueous noble cultivar rootstock extract' of kava in GAD in a larger longer term study. In addition, we plan to investigate the pharmacogenomic influence of GABA transporters on response, effects of kava on gene expression, and for the first time, the neurobiological correlates of treatment response via functional and metabolic imaging. Methods/Design: This clinical trial is funded by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (APP1063383) and co-funded by MediHerb (Integria Healthcare (Australia) Pty. Ltd). The study is a phase III, multi-site, two-arm, 18-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study using an aqueous extract of noble kava cultivar (standardised to 240 mg of kavalactones per day) versus matching placebo in 210 currently anxious participants with diagnosed GAD who are non-medicated. The study takes place at two sites: the Centre for Human Psychopharmacology (Swinburne University of Technology), Hawthorn, Melbourne, Australia; and the Academic Discipline of Psychiatry (The University of Queensland) based at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Herston, Brisbane, Australia. Written informed consent will be obtained from each participant prior to commencement in the study. The primary outcome is the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (SIGH-A). The secondary outcomes involve a range of scales that assess affective disorder symptoms and quality of life outcomes, in addition to the study of mediating biomarkers of response (assessed via genomics and neuroimaging). Discussion: If this study demonstrates positive findings in support of the superiority of kava over placebo in the treatment of GAD, and also is shown to be safe, then this plant-medicine can be considered a 'first-line' therapy for GAD. Genomic and neuroimaging data may reveal clinical response patterns and provide more evidence of the neurobiological activity of the plant extract.

260,"Depression in Later-Life Puerto Rican Primary Care Patients: The Role of Illness, Stress, Social Integration, and Religiosity","Robison, J.; Curry, L.; Gruman, C.; Covington, T.; Gaztambide, S.; Blank, K.","Background: Older Puerto Ricans belong to two rapidly growing demographic groups known to have high rates of depression: the aging and Hispanic populations. Studies of depression in Puerto Ricans have primarily focused on the impact of demographic factors and health. This study expands previous research, examining the relationships between depression and social stressors, social support, and religiosity, for Puerto Rican primary care patients aged 50 and older. Patients: Participants included 303 Puerto Ricans from six primary care clinics in a northeastern city. Methods: Patients completed in-person interview in Spanish. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview indicated depressive disorders meeting DSM-IV criteria. Bivariate and multivariate relationships between depression and demographics, health, social stress and support, and religiosity were explored. Results: One fifth of participants met DSM-IV criteria for major depression or dysthymia. Participants with the lowest income, more recent migration, and poor subjective health were significantly more likely to be depressed. In addition, rates of depression increased steeply for patients caring for grandchildren and those with personal or family legal problems. Seeing few relatives each month and needing more instrumental, emotional, or financial support were also related to higher rates of depression. Unexpectedly, low objective illness severity correlated with increased depression, whereas religiosity and religious participation had no relationship to depression. Conclusions: The findings presented here indicate the potential for social stressors and inadequate supports to substantially increase the risk of depression in older Puerto Ricans in primary care settings. Further studies should explore incorporating these social risk factors into improved prevention, clinical detection, and culturally sensitive treatment of older depressed Puerto Ricans.",2003.0,10.1017/S1041610203009505,RA8JFD9G,0,diathesis,261

A.; Greene, M. C.; Likindikoki, S.; Misinzo, L.; Ventevogel, P.; Bonz, A. G.; Bass, J. K.; Mbwambo, J. K. K.","BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a critical public health and human rights concern globally, including for refugee women in low‐resource settings. Little is known about effective interventions for this population. IPV and psychological distress have a bi‐directional relationship, indicating the potential benefit of a structured psychological component as part of efforts to reduce IPV for women currently in violent relationships. METHODS: This protocol describes a cluster randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating an 8‐session integrated psychological and advocacy intervention (Nguvu) with female adult survivors of past‐year IPV displaying moderate to severe psychological distress. Outcomes are reductions in: recurrence of IPV; symptoms of anxiety, depression and post‐traumatic stress (primary); and functional impairment (secondary). Hypothesized mediators of the intervention are improvements in social support, coping skills and support seeking. We will recruit 400 participants from existing women's support groups operating within villages in Nyarugusu refugee camp, Tanzania. Women's groups will be randomized to receive the intervention (Nguvu and usual care) or usual care alone. All eligible women will complete a baseline assessment (week 0) followed by a post‐treatment (week 9) and a 3‐month post‐treatment assessment (week 20). The efficacy of the intervention will be determined by between‐group differences in the longitudinal trajectories of primary outcomes evaluated using mixed‐effects models. Study procedures have been approved by Institutional Review Boards in the United States and Tanzania. DISCUSSION: This trial will provide evidence on the efficacy of a novel integrated group intervention aimed at secondary prevention of IPV that includes a structured psychological component to address psychological distress. The psychological and advocacy components of the proposed intervention have been shown to be efficacious for their respective outcomes when delivered in isolation; however, administering these approaches through a single, integrated intervention may result in synergistic effects given the interrelated, bidirectional relationship between IPV and mental health. Furthermore, this trial will provide information regarding the feasibility of implementing a structured intervention for IPV and mental health in a protracted humanitarian setting.

It has also been demonstrated that personality disorders in older adults complicate treatment of other psychopathology, as well as result in heightened interpersonal disturbance and emotional distress. METHODS: Two studies utilizing standard Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) to treat depression and personality disorders in older adults are reviewed. Study 1 examined 34 chronically depressed individuals aged 60 and older who were randomly assigned to receive 28 weeks of antidepressant medication plus clinical management, either alone (MED) or with the addition of DBT skills-training and scheduled telephone coaching sessions (MED + DBT). Study 2 had two phases of treatment: Phase I: 8-week open-trial of antidepressant medication (n = 65); Phase II: 24-week randomized trial of DBT + MED versus MED alone for those who prospectively failed to respond to the Phase I medication trial (n = 37). RESULTS: Study 1 demonstrated that 71 \% of MED + DBT patients were in remission at post-treatment, in contrast to 47 \% of MED patients. This became a significant difference at the 6-month follow-up; where 75 \% of MED + DBT-D patients were in remission compared with only 31 \% of MED patients. Study 2 showed that after 8 weeks of treatment with antidepressant medication alone (Phase 1) only 14 \% of the sample had at least a 50 \% reduction in HAM-D scores. Phase II results showed on average, the DBT + MED group reached depression remission by the post-group assessment and maintained these gains while the MED group did not reach remission, until the follow-up assessment. Results demonstrated superiority of DBT + MED compared to MED alone on Interpersonal Sensitivity and Interpersonal Aggression at post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: Results from these two treatment development studies indicate that applying standard DBT for the treatment of co-morbid MDD or MDD + PD in older adults is feasible, acceptable, and has clinical promise.

264,Profiles of Peritraumatic Emotions,"Lancaster, S. L.; Larsen, S. E.","Researchers have identified peritraumatic emotions as important predictors of who will develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. However, such investigations have not examined full profiles of emotions, perhaps because of the typical emphasis on fear or other Criterion A2 emotions. Such an examination could help us identify which peritraumatic emotions are prominent, and how they relate to important posttrauma outcomes. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify distinct profiles of peritraumatic emotions and their correlates using a comprehensive survey of peri- and posttraumatic reactions. We conducted a latent profile analysis of peritraumatic emotions in 398 undergraduate students who reported a DSM–IV A1 trauma and then compared the resulting profiles on trauma type, PTSD, depression, and posttraumatic cognitions. Six distinct profiles emerged: 3 had consistently low, medium, or high levels across the range of emotions, with 3 others primarily characterized by low shame and guilt, high anger and guilt, and low guilt. These profiles significantly differed in terms of trauma type, PTSD, depression, and posttraumatic cognitions. In particular, profiles with high levels of anger, shame, and guilt were consistently related to overall worse functioning. Importantly, fear and associated emotions did not differentiate between profiles. These results have important implications for the phenomenology of posttrauma emotional reactions and strongly suggest that the clinical assessment of traumatic experiences go beyond fear-based conceptualizations.",2016.0,,9VB4SABU,0,psychodynamic,265

266,The dopaminergic neurotransmitter system is associated with aggression and agitation in frontotemporal dementia,"Engelborghs, S.; Vloeberghs, E. and","To identify neurochemical correlates of behavioral and psychological signs and symptoms of dementia (BPSD), we set up a prospective study. Patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 181), mixed dementia (MXD) (n = 28), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (n = 25) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (n = 24) were included. At inclusion, all patients underwent lumbar puncture, neuropsychological examination and behavioral assessment (battery of behavioral assessment scales). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of norepinephrine and of (nor)epinephrine (MHPG), serotonin (5HIAA) and dopamine (DOPAC, HVA) metabolites were determined by HPLC and electrochemical detection. Spearman Rank-Order followed by Bonferroni correction was used for calculating correlations. In FTD patients, CSF norepinephrine levels were positively correlated with dementia severity (r = 0.539; p = 0.021). CSF DOPAC levels were correlated with BPSD in general (r = 0.537; p = 0.007), associated caregiver burden (r = 0.567; p = 0.004) and agitated and aggressive behavior (r = 0.568; p = 0.004). In a subgroup of FTD patients who did not receive psychotropic pharmacological treatment, a strong correlation between CSF HVA/5HIAA ratios (reflecting serotonergic modulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission) and aggressive behavior (r = 0.758; p = 0.009) was found. In MXD patients, (verbally) agitated behavior was positively associated with the turnover of norepinephrine (r = 0.633; p = 0.002). No significant correlations were found in AD and DLB groups. In FTD, increased activity of dopaminergic neurotransmission and altered serotonergic modulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission is associated with agitated and aggressive behavior respectively. This study demonstrated that neurochemical mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of BPSD are both BPSD-specific and disease-specific which might have implications for future development of new and more selective pharmacological treatments of BPSD. \textcopyright 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

268,Childhood maltreatment and amygdala connectivity in methamphetamine dependence: a pilot study.,"Dean, Andy C.; Kohno, Milky; Hellemann, Gerhard; London, Edythe D.","INTRODUCTION: Childhood maltreatment, a well-known risk factor for the development of substance abuse disorders, is associated with functional and structural abnormalities in the adult brain, particularly in the limbic system. However, almost no research has examined the relationship between childhood maltreatment and brain function in individuals with drug abuse disorders. METHODS: We conducted a pilot study of the relationship between childhood maltreatment (evaluated with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire; Bernstein and Fink 1998) and resting-state functional connectivity of the amygdala (bilateral region of interest) with functional magnetic resonance imaging in 15 abstinent, methamphetamine-dependent research participants. Within regions that showed connectivity with the amygdala as a function of maltreatment, we also evaluated whether amygdala connectivity was associated positively with negative affect and negatively with healthy emotional processing. RESULTS: The results indicated that childhood maltreatment was positively associated with resting-state connectivity between the amygdala and right hippocampus, right parahippocampal gyrus, right inferior temporal gyrus, right orbitofrontal cortex, cerebellum, and brainstem. Furthermore, connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampus was positively related to measures of depression, trait anxiety, and emotion dysregulation, and negatively related to self-compassion and dispositional mindfulness. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that childhood maltreatment may contribute to increased limbic connectivity and maladaptive emotional processing in methamphetamine-dependent adults, and that healthy emotion regulation strategies may serve as a therapeutic target to ameliorate the associated behavioral phenotype. Childhood maltreatment warrants further investigation as a potentially important etiological factor in the neurobiology and treatment of substance use disorders.",2014.0,10.1002/brb3.289,4ZE83BVL,0,cognitive_additional,269
269,Children and adolescents' anxiety disorders,"Denis, H.; Baghdadli, A.","Anxiety disorders were long underestimated in children by healthcare professionals, but they are now better diagnosed. They account for the most frequent psychiatric diagnosis between 6 and 18 years of age, with differences in prevalence or risk factors related to the clinical forms. Different clinical subtypes of anxiety disorders are detailed in this article: separation anxiety, specific phobia, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress syndrome, and obsessional-compulsive disorder. The repercussions of anxiety are often major on the psychological, relational, and developmental dimensions, as well as academics. Refusing school for reasons of anxiety is one of the possible and severe consequences of anxiety disorders, possibly resulting in total removal from school and the risk of early and permanent cessation of schooling. Other frequent complications are depression, and substance abuse during adolescence, as well as chronification of the disorders until adulthood. Indeed, adults affected by anxiety disorders frequently place the onset of their disorders at the beginning of adolescence. It is therefore essential to diagnose these disorders as soon as possible to set up an adapted therapeutic strategy. The main first-line treatment currently recommended in the pediatric population is cognitive and behavioral therapy, the efficacy of which has been the most clearly demonstrated. Psychoactive drugs can be used as a complement in severe or resistant cases, mainly serotonin recapture inhibitors.",2017.0,10.1016/j.arcped.2016.10.006,U6NDG39Y,0,diathesis,270

Coupled damped linear oscillator models succinctly describe daily stress and negative affect in terms of developmental forces (e.g., velocity, acceleration). Models were fit to 56-day daily response data from 42 aging adults (Mage = 78.8 years; SDage = 6.6 years) to observe and understand linkages between daily stress and affect. It was speculated that individuals with greater resilience would experience stress as less coupled to changes in negative affect (less stress reactivity), and would recover their affective equilibrium more quickly following a given exogenous stressor (greater stress recovery). To identify resilience resources related to reliable interindividual differences in coupling and damping between stress and negative affect, we examined possible protective factors. Aspects of personality and social support predicted both the strength and nature of this coupling, such that higher levels of these resources resulted in greater protection from the cost to negative affect from stress, as observed in damping of negative affect and decreased coupling between systems.

271,Predictors of smoking cessation among persons in remission from substance-use disorders,"Agosti, V.","Though remission of substance-use disorders (SUDs) has been correlated with increased odds of smoking cessation, a subgroup of remitters continues to smoke. However, information regarding this population is lacking. Data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions were analyzed. The sample included 1417 smokers with SUDs who completed Wave 1 (Baseline) and Wave 2 (Follow-up) assessments. Results indicated that the presence of generalized anxiety disorder, Cluster A personality disorders, major depression/dysthymic disorder, or manic depression/hypomanic disorder since Wave 1 was associated with a reduced likelihood of smoking cessation. These data suggest that healthcare providers who treat smokers in remission from SUDs should carefully assess for the presence of mood disorders and provide appropriate treatment, as well as offering adjunctive evidence-based smoking cessation treatments.",2014.0,,6XJC82W2,0,personality,272

K.; Bennett, A.; Bennett, K.; Christensen, H.","Background: Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) delivered through the Internet is effective as a treatment in reducing insomnia in individuals seeking help for insomnia. CBT-I also lowers levels of depression in this group. However, it is not known if targeting insomnia using CBT-I will lower depressive symptoms, and thus reduce the risk of major depressive episode onset, in those specifically at risk for depression. Therefore, this study aims to examine whether Internet delivery of fully automated self-help CBT-I designed to reduce insomnia will prevent depression.Method/design: A sample of 1,600 community-dwelling adults (aged 18-64), who screen positive for both subclinical levels of depressive symptoms and insomnia, will be recruited via various media and randomised to either a 9-week online insomnia treatment programme, Sleep Healthy Using The internet (SHUTi), or an online attention-matched control group (HealthWatch). The primary outcome variable will be depression symptom levels at the 6-month post-intervention on the Patient Heath Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). A secondary outcome will be onset of major depressive episodes assessed at the 6-month post-intervention using 'current' and 'time from intervention' criteria from the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview.Discussion: This trial is the first randomised controlled trial of an Internet-based insomnia intervention as an indicated preventative programme for depression.

Michael; Vitiello, Benedetto; Kratochvil, Christopher J.; Burns, Barbara J.; Silva, Susan G.; Reinecke, Mark A.; March, John S.","Objective: The cost-effectiveness of three active interventions for major depression in adolescents was compared after 36 weeks of treatment in the Treatment of Adolescents with Depression Study. Method: Outpatients aged 12 to 18 years with a primary diagnosis of major depression participated in a randomized controlled trial conducted at 13 U.S. academic and community clinics from 2000 to 2004. Three hundred twenty-seven participants randomized to 1 of 3 active treatment arms, fluoxetine alone (n = 109), cognitive-behavioral therapy (n = 111) alone, or their combination (n = 107), were evaluated for a 3-month acute treatment and a 6-month continuation/maintenance treatment period. Costs of services received for the 36 weeks were estimated and examined in relation to the number of depression-free days and quality-adjusted life-years. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were also generated. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess treatment differences on the quality-adjusted life-years and cost-effectiveness measures. Results: Cognitive-behavioral therapy was the most costly treatment component (mean \ \$ \ 1,787 [in monotherapy] and \ \$ \ 1,833 [in combination therapy], median \ \$ \ 1,923 [for both]). Reflecting higher direct and indirect costs associated with psychiatric hospital use, the costs of services received outside Treatment of Adolescents with Depression Study in fluoxetine-treated patients (mean \ \$ \ 5,382, median \ \$ \ 2,341) were significantly higher than those in participants treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy (mean \ \$ \ 3,102, median \ \$ \ 1,373) or combination (mean \ \$ \ 2,705, median \ \$ \ 927). Accordingly, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves indicate that combination treatment is highly likely ( \ \textgreater \ 90 \ \% \ ) to be more cost-effective than fluoxetine alone at 36 weeks. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is not likely to be more cost-effective than fluoxetine. Conclusions: These findings support the use of combination treatment in adolescents with depression over monotherapy.

On the competition day, they were assessed 1 h before and immediately after the contest. Competitive trait anxiety, neuroticism and extraversion were measured at the start of the study. The competition was the most significant and stressful event experienced in the examined period and had a pervasive influence on athletes' affective states. All examined appraisal and personality factors were somewhat associated with pre- and post-competition affective states. Competitive trait anxiety was a key moderator of the relationship between cognitive appraisal and affective states. This study supports the idea that cognitive appraisal and situational and personality factors exert main and interactive effects on athletes' pre- and post-competition affects.

278,Establishing the therapeutic impact of empathy through affect sharing .,"Herzog, Bruce","What if the enduring desire of the psychoanalytic discipline to be seen as scientific provoked the suppression of certain therapeutic practices? It would explain why Kohut defined empathy only as a mode of clinical observation when he began discussing it, because even that proposal risked being seen as unscientific and controversial. Today, there exists a more favorable professional atmosphere, which should allow for empathic phenomena to now be included in a theory of cure. Clinical examples in this article demonstrate how affect sharing can be used in this way. Affect sharing occurs when the therapist believes he or she is reverberating with the affect the patient feels, resulting from a sharing selfobject transference, the aim of which is to elicit a shared emotional state with the therapist. In descriptive affect sharing, therapists are encouraged to feel what their patients are feeling when listening to their patients' evocative descriptions. In active affect sharing, an activity introduced by the patient can lead to a shared emotional experience within the analytic dyad. These patient-initiated empathic events are experienced as having been shared when the therapist communicates-verbally or non-verbally, directly or indirectly-that affect sharing has occurred. Incrementally escalating affective communications are defined as reciprocal intensifications of affect sharing, where both patient and therapist use emotional phraseology and tone to intensify and solidify the shared empathic connection. Affect sharing is a form of empathy that constitutes its own selfobject experience, with mutative properties that firmly establish empathy as an integral component of therapeutic change.

Methods: From one of the main referral hospitals, 300 cases and 300 age- and sex-matched controls were recruited. On top of demographic variables, the following variables were compared in the two groups: personality traits, psychological condition, religiosity, coping skills, general health, and recent stressful events. Results: Having adjusted for recent stressful events as the most important factor (OR = 1.66, P-value \ \textless \ 0.001), the main significant variables were: general health (1.04, P = 0.02), the support of friends (OR = 0.95, P-value = 0.04), being problem-focused mentality (OR = 0.88, P-value = 0.005), and intrinsic religiousness (OR = 0.86, P-value = 0.01). Conclusions: Although, recent stress increased the risk of SA considerably, other factors such as general health, friends' support, and being problem-focused may predispose subjects independently. Conversely, intrinsic religious beliefs and close social networks may have protective effects. Therefore, a multi-disciplinary approach is recommended to minimize the burden of SA in Iran.",2015.0,,IE8USASQ,0,personality,280

281,Change in self- and object representation during long-term dynamically oriented treatment,"Gruen, R. J.; Blatt, S. J.","Recently psychoanalysis has begun to consider how cognitive-affective structures and schemata of self and others, guide and motivate behavior. Impaired and/or distored representations are assumed to play a significant role in psychopathology. One goal of long-term treatment should be the modification of pathological images of self and other. In this article, we present material from two patients in long-term, dynamically oriented treatment; one, a schizophrenic patient, the other, a patient with a borderline character disorder. Changes in representations of self and others over the course of treatment are examined in conjunction with ongoing independent assessments of changes in the transference in individual therapy. Significant changes in representational structures were closely related to changes taking place in the transference relationship. The findings suggest that growth in representational structures follows a developmental continuum, and that the integration and consolidation of conflicting self-images is dependent on the resolution of central psychological conflicts involving parental representations. The patient's development of a capacity for empathy seems to play an important role in this process.",1990.0,,TF6AT9EL,0,psychodynamic,282

Material and methods: The study included 27 patients with unilateral amputation; all patients had chronic phantom pain. The patients were classified into two groups. Seventeen patients received 10 minutes real rTMS over the hand area of motor cortex (20 Hz, 10 second trains, intensity 80 \% of motor threshold) every day for five consecutive days and 10 patients received sham stimulation. Pain was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Leeds assessment of neuropathic symptoms and signs (LANSS) scale, before and after the first, fifth sessions, one and two months after the last session. Quantitative determination of serum beta-endorphin before and after five sessions was measured. Results: There was no significant difference between true and sham groups in the duration of illness, VAS, LANSS scores and resting motor threshold in upper and lower limb amputation at the base line. VAS and LANS scores of the patients who received real rTMS decreased more over the course of the treatment through the different points of follow-up (after five sessions, one and two months) than those who received sham stimulation. Serum beta-endorphin was increased significantly after real stimulation with no changes in patients received shame. Serum beta-endorphin showed no significant correlation to Hamilton depression, anxiety, VAS and LANS scores in true or sham groups before or after five sessions for rTMS. Conclusion: These results confirm that five daily sessions of rTMS over motor cortex can produce long lasting pain relief in patients with phantom pain and it might be related to an elevation of serum betaendorphin concentration. \textcopyright W.

284,Reflecting the health care experiences of adolescents: The role of risk behaviors and the adolescent-provider relationship on the use of medical and mental health services.,"Carino, Tanisha Villegas","Adolescence is a transitional period spanning anywhere from ages 11 to 24 years. It is a period of heightened physical, cognitive, and social role development. Adolescence can also be a period of vulnerability where a significant proportion of youth experience physical and sexual abuse, broken homes, and unsafe neighborhoods. In addition, risk behaviors, such as substance use, emerge, potentially leading to short term consequences such as increased risk of unintentional injuries or to long-term consequences such as smoking-related mortality and morbidity in adulthood. One aspect of preventing the initiation of and consequences following from participation in risk behaviors is the healthcare system and a continual relationship with a primary care practitioner. This dissertation critiques the applicability of the Behavioral Model of Health Service Use in explaining adolescents' use of ambulatory care services. A new framework is proposed addressing adolescents' healthcare needs within a developmental context and their experiences obtaining healthcare. The validity of the framework is examined empirically by two studies. The first study assesses substance use and depressive symptoms as determinants of the use of medical and mental health services. The second study identifies specific characteristics of the primary care practitioner associated with use of medical and mental health services. The studies used a cross-sectional, observational design with nationally representative survey data. The data source chosen was the 1997 Commonwealth Fund Survey of the Health of Adolescent Girls. The study population is in-school adolescent males and females ages 11 to 18, grades 5-12. There were 6,748 students who participated from 299 public, private, and parochial schools in the United States. Findings from these studies support the development of a model of utilization that recognizes the unique health needs and experiences of adolescents in using healthcare services. They also justify inclusion of risk behaviors in conceptualizing adolescent need for healthcare services. Without the consideration of behavior, evaluations of the appropriateness, comprehensiveness, and need for health services for adolescents is limited in scope. This project provides evidence of the importance of having a regular relationship with a primary care practitioner and confidentiality specifically for adolescents' healthcare.

285,Abandoned without warning: Resonance of the shame of early loss when an analyst dies.,"Randles, Jenny; Thomson-Salo, Frances","The sudden loss of a therapist can be confusing and damaging for a patient who has been in ongoing psychotherapy. We posit that there is a similarity of affect between patients whose analysts die and children who have experienced a variety of parenting failures, including the actual death of a parent. Children react to the death of a parent with a sense of shame, as though they feel themselves to be defective being unable to keep the parent attached to them. A further link is made with the development in infants of a sense of shame in the face of their parents' unavailability because of depression or withdrawal. Children who need to deal with misattuned or rejecting responses from parents who have been unable to sustain interest in them also feel shame. Such infants learn to look without seeing, listen without hearing. We suggest that these early experiences shape a patient's response in the face of their therapist's untimely death, where the child-patient has been unable to keep their therapists attached to them-especially when there has been prior illness. In this chapter, we will be exploring, through extensive case material, what happens when something goes awry, when the therapist dies and the patient is abandoned part of the way through a therapy, often without warning. Analytic therapists have to work through their denial of their own death (Deutsch, 2011) to reach a space where they are able to see what the patient who has lost a previous therapist through death needs from them (Casement, 1985). If this particular vulnerability to feeling shamed is not recognized in the subsequent therapy, the patient may be left with a sense of a failed therapy and an inadequately worked-through mourning process.

Using a case-control design, MVC deaths were ascertained using a military mortality registry, and an integrated health system database provided information on health system eligibility, pharmacy transactions, and medical encounters. Cases and controls were matched on comparable observation time outside periods of deployment. Among selected categories, only one, antidepressant medications, was an independent predictor of fatal MVC (odds ratio, 3.19; 95 \% confidence interval, 1.01-10.07). Male gender, Black race, enlisted rank, service branch (Navy and Marine Corps), and selected co-morbidities were also independent predictors. Unexpectedly, the odds of younger age quartiles ( \textless 27 years) and history of deployment were reduced for MVC cases. Although results need to be considered in the context of data limitations, the association between prescribed antidepressants and fatal MVC may reflect unmeasured co-morbidities, such as combined effects of prescribed and over-the-counter medications and/or alcohol or other substance abuse. Younger individuals, representing new military accessions in training or returning from deployment with serious injuries, may have fewer opportunities to operate vehicles, or targeted efforts to reduce MVC following deployment may be showing a positive effect.",2010.0,10.1016/j.aap.2009.07.024,AW4DAI4P,0,cognitive_additional,287

288,"Adult attachment patterns, mental representation of self, and faith: Mediators of childhood trauma and affect-behavior regulations in adulthood.","Han, GiBaeg","The purpose of this study was to investigate psychological mechanism by which four intra- and inter-personal characteristics of an individual (anxious and avoidant adult attachment patterns, images of self, and religious faith) mediate the relationship between childhood trauma and each of three affect-behavior regulation problems in adulthood (symptoms of depression, disordered eating behaviors, and substance abuse). A total of 401 college student participants completed a packet of 18 surveys including 10 surveys used in the present study. Structural equation modeling was used to test each of three hypothesized structural models (Depression, Eating Disturbances, and Substance Abuse). A series of multi-group analyses conducted to test if each of three hypothesized models is invariant across gender indicated no significant difference between females and males. Thus, the data were combined across gender to test for mediated effects in each of three hypothesized models. The results indicated: (a) for the hypothesized model for depression, anxious attachment patterns, avoidant attachment patterns, and negative self-images, but not religious faith, fully mediated the relationship between childhood trauma and symptoms of depression; (b) for the model for eating disturbances, anxious attachment and negative images of self, but not avoidant attachment and religious faith, fully mediated the association between childhood trauma and disordered eating behaviors; and (c) for the mode for substance abuse, anxious attachment and poor religious faith, but not avoidant attachment and negative self-images, fully mediated the relationship between childhood trauma and substance abuse. The findings of the present study have noteworthy implications for treatment. When clients who suffer from symptoms of depression, disordered eating behaviors, and/or substance abuse report a history of repetitive abuse and neglect by primary caregivers in childhood, clinicians need to assist clients in: (a) understanding an association of childhood maltreatment with affect-behavior regulation problems; (b) being aware of an impact of abuse and neglect by attachment figures in childhood on negative mental representations of self, insecure attachment patterns in close relationship, and poor religious faith; and (c) most importantly, deepening an understanding of how their negative images of self, anxious and avoidant adult attachment patterns, and/or poor religious faith and practices, rather than parental abuse and neglect in childhood itself, directly predict their presenting symptoms of depression, disordered eating behaviors, and/or substance abuse problems. In doing so, it is crucial for clinicians to provide clients with secure and comforting therapeutic atmosphere, focus on building trusting working relationship with clients, and be aware of how clients' transference and clinicians' own counter-transference interact with each other and influence therapeutic process and effectiveness. Several important limitations of the present study and implications for future studies were discussed.

The patient, Dolores, a single woman in her forties, was in analysis with the author a few years ago, at a frequency of four sessions a week. Dolores's customary expression was sad and resigned, rather wild and unappealing. After giving up some music studies, she had obtained a diploma in a paramedical profession and was working in a hospital emergency service, where she was in frequent contact with suicidal patients. Dolores herself was suffering from depression and anxiety and was regularly abandoned by men with whom she was seeking to have a stable relationship; she had undertaken a course of psychotherapy and then a long psychoanalysis, each time with a woman. In the course of the treatments, Dolores's anxieties had been connected essentially with a series of periods that she had spent in hospital between the ages of 2 and 4 years old because of a recurring infection, which had isolated her from her family. She still bore a strong grudge against her parents, whom she criticized bitterly for having neglected and abandoned her, and her emotional wounds were far from healed. After three years in analysis with the author, Dolores retrieved the memory that she had been subjected to sexual abuse by a neighbor between the ages of 5 and 8. She had not dared to talk about it either to her parents or to her therapists, or even to the author, until that day. The author then understood that the separation anxieties that Dolores was reproducing in the transference had been infiltrated by the repetition of an unconscious perverse relationship of the abuser/abused type.

MDD patients received treatment with duloxetine 60 mg daily for 12 weeks with an optional dose increase to 120 mg daily after 8 weeks. All participants had serial imaging at weeks 0, 1, 8, and 12 on a 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. Neuroimaging tasks included emotional facial processing, negative attentional bias (emotional Stroop), resting state functional MRI and structural MRI. RESULTS: A significant group by time interaction was identified in the anterior default mode network in which MDD patients showed increased connectivity with treatment, while there were no significant changes in healthy participants. In the emotional Stroop task, increased posterior cingulate activation in MDD patients normalized following treatment. No significant group by time effects were observed for happy or sad facial processing, including in amygdala responsiveness, or in regional cerebral volumes. Reduced baseline resting state connectivity within the orbitofrontal component of the default mode network was predictive of clinical response. An early increase in hippocampal volume was predictive of clinical response. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline resting state functional connectivity was predictive of subsequent clinical response. Complementary effects of treatment were observed from the functional neuroimaging correlates of affective facial expressions, negative attentional bias, and resting state. No significant effects were observed in affective facial processing, while the interaction effect in negative attentional bias and individual group effects in resting state connectivity could be related to the SNRI class of antidepressant medication. The specificity of the observed effects to SNRI pharmacological treatments requires further investigation.

293,Depression in a marital context.,"Teichman, Yona","Studies the effect of treating a spouse's depression within the marital context. The author presents a reciprocal model of depression and an interpersonal treatment context that are based on an integration of systems theory and cognitive theories of depression. Families with members who suffer from pathological or adjustment problems are caught up in repetitive cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and interactional reciprocities that maintain the problem. The primary aims of treatment are to increase the insight of the couple dyad regarding these reciprocities, namely, their respective part in maintaining depression, and then to instill alternative reciprocal behavior patterns. This cognitive marital therapy (CMT) approach was compared with individual cognitive therapy, as well as with a traditional pharmacotherapy (PT) regime and a control group. Ss were 60 depressed patients (aged 28-65 yrs) and their 24-65 yr old spouses. CMT was found to be the most successful form of intervention, reducing global depression scores as well as experienced and perceived hostility between spouses. Because PT was also effective in reducing hostility, interweaving pharmacological treatments with marital treatment modalities bears potential for facilitating remission from depressive illness.

294,Improving the design of maintenance studies for bipolar disorder,"Gitlin, M. J.; Abulseoud, O.; Frye, M. A.","Background: In contrast to the trial design of acute mania studies, there is no standard design for bipolar maintenance studies. Over the past 15 years, the design of monotherapy maintenance studies in bipolar disorder has evolved significantly, but recent study designs continue to differ in important ways. Scope: We reviewed the design of recent controlled bipolar maintenance studies, using PubMed, from August 2006 to August 2009, examining the strengths and weaknesses of different study design features. Findings: Design differences are sufficiently important that the disparate results across maintenance studies may reflect either true differences in medication efficacy or the effects of these design differences on outcome. Design elements such as recent episode polarity, stabilization criteria, using enriched versus nonenriched samples, length of stabilization before randomization, length of experimental phase, and recurrence outcome criteria are critical factors that differ widely across studies and likely play a role in study outcome. Conclusions: As consensus for trial designs for bipolar maintenance therapy is developed, it will be easier to develop algorithms for maintenance treatment based on results from studies as opposed to clinical opinions. \textcopyright 2010 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.",2010.0,10.1185/03007995.2010.489830,FYA9JPP4,0,cognitive_additional,295
295,Association of work-related stress with mental health problems in a special police force unit,"Garbarino, S.; Cuomo, G.; Chiorri, C.; Magnavita, N.","Objectives: Law and order enforcement tasks may expose special force police officers to significant psychosocial risk factors. The aim of this work is to investigate the relationship between job stress and the presence of mental health symptoms while controlling sociodemographical, occupational and personality variables in special force police officers. Method: At different time points, 292 of 294 members of the 'VI Reparto Mobile', a special police force engaged exclusively in the enforcement of law and order, responded to our invitation to complete questionnaires for the assessment of personality traits, work-related stress (using the Demand-Control-Support (DCS) and the Effort-Reward-Imbalance (ERI) models) and mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and burnout. Results: Regression analyses showed that lower levels of support and reward and higher levels of effort and overcommitment were associated with higher levels of mental health symptoms. Psychological screening revealed 21 (7.3 \ \% \ ) likely cases of mild depression (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI≥10). Officers who had experienced a discrepancy between work effort and rewards showed a marked increase in the risk of depression (OR 7.89, 95 \ \% \ CI 2.32 to 26.82) when compared with their counterparts who did not perceive themselves to be in a condition of distress. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that work-related stress may play a role in the development of mental health problems in police officers. The prevalence of mental health symptoms in the cohort investigated here was low, but not negligible in the case of depression. Since special forces police officers have to perform sensitive tasks for which a healthy psychological functioning is needed, the results of this study suggest that steps should be taken to prevent distress and improve the mental well-being of these workers.",2013.0,,QFURT8F5,0,personality,296
296,A longitudinal study evaluating early observations and representations of relationships: Separation-individuation theory and attachment theory in a qualitative approach.,"Blom, Inga K. M.","This research is a mixed-methods, longitudinal study of eight individuals, from infancy to middle age. These individuals were initially observed almost daily as infants, interacting with their mothers and others over the course of several years. Unstructured participant and nonparticipant observations had been compiled at the Masters Children's Center and in the participants' homes by a team of psychologists, pediatricians and psychoanalysts, with the goal of capturing normal development. This initial project represented one of the first attempts to understand what actually happens in early relationships, and how mother and child together influence myriad aspects of development. The current research offers a unique opportunity to understand how those early relationships were internalized and came to be represented over time. Using qualitative methods, and specifically a Grounded Theory approach to the early observations, psychodynamic theories of child development were incorporated to develop a notational system that guided analysis of the original observations, and when formulating connections to functioning in adulthood. Particular attention was given to Separation-Individuation Theory, which developed out of the original observations, and Attachment Theory. Observations that covered several months of individuals' early development, around two years of age, were evaluated to understand the developing capacity for object constancy-how early behaviors conveyed qualities of internal representations of self and other. The eight individuals, now adults, were also interviewed using the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI), and were given the following questionnaires: the Differentiation of Self Inventory (DSI), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale (RSES) and the Life Events Questionnaire (LEQ). Unlike most studies that use the AAI, in the present research overall AAI classification, sub-classification, and subscale ratings contributed to an evaluation of representations of early relationships in adulthood, and were considered along with the self-report data All of these together illuminated the capacity for object constancy in adulthood, and which psychological defenses were activated in the context of thinking about family members. The observational and follow-up data were presented in the form of individual case studies, that included illustrative quotations, and comparisons between subjects. The observational data and the Adult Attachment Interview provided rich and detailed information about these individuals, and made it uniquely possible to consider continuity and discontinuity of representations of early relationships and psychological functioning over time. This research has utility in clinical and research domains. It provides a rare opportunity to examine long-term effects of early experiences, it emphasizes the scope of observational data and the myriad factors that influence development, and the value of the Adult Attachment Interview.

297,A comparative analysis of interpersonal schemas associated to social anxiety and aggression,"Vagos, P.; Santos, I.; Rijos, D.","Introduction: Social anxiety and aggression have been associated with negative interpersonal schemas. Recent theories suggest that a minority of socially anxious individuals practice aggressive behaviors. Objectives: To analyze the similarities in the interpersonal schemas associated simultaneously to social anxiety and aggression. Methods: A sample of 267 late adolescents (mean age of 16.56 years old; 71.9 \% female) was assessed for relational and overt aggression, for social anxiety, and for negative interpersonal schemas. Results: Relational and overt aggresion and social anxiety associated positively with the same five negative interpersonal schemas: perceptions of others as abusive and not to be trusted; approval and recognition seeking as a mote for behavior in social interactions; personal vulnerability to harm or illness, and pessimism in relation to future events. Relational aggression and social anxiety shared positive associations with four negative schemas, which did not correlate with overt aggression. These schemas relate to perceptions of: emotional deprivation in social interactions, personal defectiveness and shame, personal dependence and incompetence in daily tasks, and the need to subjugate to others as condition for sustained relationships. Conclusions: Given that interpersonal schemas may impact on the subsequent cognitive, affective, and behavioral responses to a social event, the similarity found on interpersonal schemas for social anxiety and aggression may expain the co-existence of these two apparently distinct constructs.",2013.0,,QAD9F5HR,0,psychodynamic,298

DESIGN: A longitudinal study of a cohort of master athletes SETTING: The Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center (GRECC), Baltimore VA Medical Center, Baltimore, Maryland. PARTICIPANTS: Ten older (59 ± 8 years, mean ± SD), highly conditioned (maximal aerobic capacity Vo(2max) 50 ± 5 mL/kg/min), aerobically trained athletes. INTERVENTION: Five to eight years of longitudinal follow-up of athletes who had previously participated in a 3-month-long detraining intervention. MEASUREMENTS: At baseline, all 10 athletes had their history taken and underwent physical examinations, metabolic testing, electrocardiogram at rest, exercise treadmill tests, exercise thallium scintigrams, and exercise multigated acquisition scans. After 3 months of deconditioning, they had repeat maximal exercise stress tests. After 5 to 8 years of follow-up, they were re-evaluated, including history and physical examination and measurement of their Vo(2max). RESULT: All 10 master athletes had normal studies at baseline. At the end of 3 months of detraining, three of these athletes had exercise-induced silent ischemia, which disappeared after retraining in two subjects and persisted at a higher heart rate in one subject. Over a 5- to 8-year period of observation, two of these three athletes with silent ischemia experienced major cardiac events (sudden death, cardiac bypass surgery). The other seven athletes did not have any cardiovascular events. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise-induced silent ischemia after a short period of detraining in highly trained older athletes may be a predictor of future cardiac events.

It is suggested that postnatal depression impacted negatively on the developing relationship between the mother and her infant producing an insecure attachment leading to the development of an eating disorder. This is explored with particular reference to Green's concept of the dead mother complex. Parallels are drawn between the dead mother complex and the psychopathology of eating disorders and a number of common themes are identified.

300,"A longitudinal analysis of emotional impact, coping strategies and post-traumatic psychological growth following spinal cord injury: A 10-year review","Pollard, C.; Kennedy, P.","Objectives. To review emotional impact, psychological growth and coping strategies in a sample of traumatic spinal cord injured people from 12 weeks post-injury to 10 years post-hospital discharge. Design. Longitudinal, multiple wave panel design. Methods. Eighty-seven people with traumaticaily acquired spinal cord injuries were assessed at 12 weeks post-injury and followed up 10 years later (43 \% of the original sample responded). The Beck Depression Inventory, the State Anxiety Inventory, the COPE Scale, the Functional Independence Measure and the Social Support Inventory were completed on both occasions. Results. Rates of anxiety and depression had changed little over the 10-year period. Two-thirds of the sample showed no signs or symptoms of depression. Coping strategies remained relatively stable over time, statistically significant regression models (coping strategies at week 12 post-injury) predicted one-third of the variance in depression at year 10. Rates of post-traumatic psychological growth were associated with higher levels of psychological distress. Conclusions. These results suggest that many people living with spinal cord injury manage the consequences of their disability without significant levels of psychopathology. However, the coping strategies they employ remain critical in accounting for this adjustment. The relationship between post-traumatic growth and psychological well-being was found to be complex, raising many questions for future research. \textcopyright 2007 The British Psychological Society.",2007.0,10.1348/135910707X197046,XZYW6KQA,0,diathesis,301

302,Patients' perceived level of social isolation affects the prognosis of low back pain,"Oliveira, V. C.; Ferreira, M. L.; Morso, L.; Albert, H. B.; Refshauge, K. M.; Ferreira, P. H.","Background: Perceived social isolation is prevalent among patients with low back pain (LBP) and could be a potential prognostic factor for clinical outcomes following an episode of LBP. Methods: A secondary analysis of an original prospective cohort study, which investigated the validity of the Danish version of the STarT Back Screening Tool (STarT), investigated whether social isolation predicts the clinical outcomes of disability, anxiety, depression and pain catastrophizing in people with LBP. Patients with LBP of any duration (N=204) from Middelfart, Denmark, were included. Social isolation was measured at baseline using the friendship scale (score ranges from 0 to 24, with lower values meaning higher perceived social isolation), and outcomes were measured at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. Regression models investigated whether social isolation at baseline predicted the outcomes at 6-month follow-up. Results: Some level of social isolation was reported by 39.2 \% of the participants (n=80) with 5.9 \% (n=12) being very socially isolated. One-point difference on social isolation predicted one point on a 100-point disability scale (adjusted unstandardized coefficient: -0.91; 95 \% confidence interval (CI): -1.56 to -0.26). Social isolation predicted anxiety; however, a change of one point on the social isolation scale represents a difference of only 0.08 points on a 22-point scale in anxiety (95 \% CI: 0.01-0.15) and is unlikely to denote clinical importance. Social isolation did not predict pain catastrophizing or depression. Conclusions: Patients' perceived social isolation predicts disability related to LBP. Further understanding of the role of social isolation in LBP is warranted. \textcopyright 2014 European Pain Federation - EFIC \textregistered .",2014.0,10.1002/ejp.578,RTXPYW5U,0,cognitive_additional,303

Up to half will not respond fully to medication.The subjective experience of living with late-onset psychosis (LOP) has not yet been considered and this study represents a preliminary attempt to explore the subjective experience and psychological features of older people living with LOP. Method: The study was conducted in Ireland. Seven participants between the ages of 67 and 87 years who met diagnostic criteria for very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis were interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule. Participants spoke about previous life experiences as well as the experience of developing and living with LOP. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to identify common themes within their accounts. Results: Four themes emerged which reflected participants' subjective experiences of earlier life stages as well as their current experiences of LOP. Three interrelated themes described participants' experiences of social isolation, a solitary coping style and the experience of the self as 'different'. A final theme reflected participants' attempts to explain and find meaning in their psychotic experiences. Conclusions: Results support the view that the experience of LOP emerges in the context of psychosocial vulnerabilities combined with adversities associated with the experience of ageing. \textcopyright 2009 Taylor \& Francis.",2009.0,10.1080/13607860903046453,A9FG5L4Y,0,cognitive_additional,304

305,Sleep restriction worsens mood and emotion regulation in adolescents,"Kt, Baum; A, Desai; J, Field; Le, Miller; J, Rausch; Dw, Beebe","BACKGROUND: The relationship between inadequate sleep and mood has been well-established in adults and is supported primarily by correlational data in younger populations. Given that adolescents often experience shortened sleep on school nights, we sought to better understand the effect of experimentally induced chronic sleep restriction on adolescents' mood and mood regulation. METHODS: Fifty healthy adolescents, ages 14-17, completed a 3-week sleep manipulation protocol involving a baseline week, followed by a sleep restriction (SR) condition (6.5 hr in bed per night for five nights) and healthy sleep duration (HS) condition (10 hr in bed per night for five nights). The study used a randomized, counterbalanced, crossover experimental design. Participants' sleep was monitored at home via self-report and actigraphy. At the end of each condition, participants and their parents completed questionnaires of mood and mood regulation. To assess for expectancy effects, we also analyzed parent and teen ratings of hyperactivity/impulsivity, which prior research suggests is not sensitive to SR in adolescents. Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests compared questionnaire outcomes across the two conditions. RESULTS: Participants averaged 2.5 more hours of sleep per night during HS relative to SR. Compared with HS, adolescents rated themselves as significantly more tense/anxious, angry/hostile, confused, and fatigued, and as less vigorous (p = .001-.01) during SR. Parents and adolescents also reported greater oppositionality/irritability and poorer emotional regulation during SR compared with HS (p < .05). There were no cross-condition differences in depression or hyperactivity/impulsivity (p > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Findings complement prior correlational study results to show that after only a few days of shortened sleep, at a level of severity that is experienced regularly by millions of adolescents on school nights, adolescents have worsened mood and decreased ability to regulate negative emotions.",2014.0,10.1111/jcpp.12125,JQICI8S4,0,cognitive_additional,306
306,Chronic stress is linked to 5-HT1A receptor changes and functional disintegration of the limbic networks,"Jovanovic, H.; Perski, A.; Berglund, H.; Savic, I.","There are increasing reports about stress related cognitive and psychic declines in subjects who have no psychiatric premorbidity, depression, or major life trauma. Yet, little is known about the underlying neurobiology. Based on the typical symptomatology, fMRI data suggesting that stress activates the limbic circuits, and animal data showing a major involvement of the 5-HT1A receptor in stress regulation, we hypothesized that enduring daily stress causes widespread limbic dysfunctions, and specific changes of the 5-HT1A receptor. To test these hypotheses combined PET studies were carried out in 16 chronically stressed, and 16 non-stressed subjects. Limbic function was tested by measuring cerebral blood flow during rest, and when using an odor activation paradigm. 5-HT1A receptor binding potential (BP) was assessed with [11C]WAY100635. All subjects went through a battery of neuropsychological tests. Stressed subjects showed a functional disconnection between the amygdala and ACC/medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and an impaired odor activation of the ACC. They also displayed a reduced 5-HT1A receptor BP in the anterior cingulate (ACC), the insular-cortex, and the hippocampus. Their performance in attention-, odor discrimination-, and semantic memory tasks was impaired, and correlated with the BP-values in the respective region. The degree of reported stress was inversely correlated with activation of ACC, and the 5-HT1A receptor BP in the amygdala and hippocampus. Enduring every day psychosocial stress seems to be associated with a limbic reduction of 5-HT1A receptor binding and functional disintegration of ACC/mPFC. These changes support the notion of an impaired top-down regulation of stress stimuli, and identify potential targets for early treatment. \textcopyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.",2011.0,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.12.060,QD73J7FG,0,diathesis,307

A.; Barnason, S.; Zimmerman, L.","Although there is extensive literature on symptoms experienced by patients after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABS), there is a paucity of data on symptom clusters and their impact on functional outcomes. The purpose of these descriptive, secondary analyses was to identify and describe cluster subgroups of 226 elderly CABS patients at discharge and to examine the cluster's impact on psychosocial functioning over time (baseline, 6 weeks, and 3 months) using the 36-item Medical Outcome Study Short Form subscales. Cluster analysis revealed a 3-cluster solution with low, low-moderate, and moderate symptom burden clusters. Significant differences were detected for Duke Activity Status Index (F(2,223) = 5.12, P = .007), Barnason Efficacy Expectation Scale (F(2,223) = 9.60, P \textless .0001), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (F(2,219) = 15.14, P \textless .0001), and New York Heart Association classification (chi = 17.44, P = .008). Significant differences were noted on all variables between the low and moderate symptom burden clusters with differences between the low-moderate and moderate clusters for only the Barnason Efficacy Expectation Scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Those in the moderate symptom burden cluster had more symptoms, anxiety, and depression along with lower self-efficacy and physiological functioning than those in the other 2 clusters. There was no interaction or simple main effects for the role-emotional or social subscales as measured by the 36-item Medical Outcome Study Short Form. There was no significant interaction for mental functioning by time and cluster (F(4,641) = .30, P = .88); however, there was a simple main effect for cluster (F(2,641) = 4.11, P = .02). Follow-up analysis indicated significant differences between the low and low-moderate clusters, indicating that those with low symptom burden had significantly better mental health functioning than those with moderate symptom burden. Findings provide a foundation of knowledge on symptom clusters in CABS populations and may be useful to clinicians to identify patients at risk for slowed or delayed recovery and for early intervention.",2010.0,,U5NS8ZAD,0,behavior,308

T.; Arseneault, L.","Purpose: To identify contextual and interpersonal factors that distinguish families in which the intergenerational transmission of maltreatment is maintained from families in which the cycle is broken. Methods: The sample was composed of 1,116 families in the United Kingdom who participated in the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study. We assessed mother's childhood history of maltreatment retrospectively with a validated and reliable interview. Prospective reports of children's physical maltreatment were collected repeatedly up to 12 years. We compared families in which mothers but not children had experienced maltreatment with families in which both mothers and children had experienced maltreatment, and with families without maltreatment, on a range of contextual and interpersonal factors known to affect child development. Results: In multivariate analyses, supportive and trusting relationships with intimate partners, high levels of maternal warmth toward children, and low levels of partner violence between adults distinguished families in which mothers but not children experienced maltreatment from families in which mothers and children experienced maltreatment. Families in which only mothers experienced maltreatment were largely similar to families in which neither generation experienced maltreatment, except that mothers belonging to the former group were more likely to have a lifetime history of depression and low levels of social support. Conclusions: Safe, stable, nurturing relationships between intimate partners and between mothers and children are associated with breaking the cycle of abuse in families. Additional research is needed to determine whether these factors have a causal role in preventing the transmission of maltreatment from one generation to the next. \textcopyright 2013 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

Bereavement under these circumstances, however, has been little studied. Forty predominantly midlife parents (20 men and 20 women) of predominantly young adult children (27 men and 13 women) who died in traffic accidents were studied 25.6 months after the death. The parents completed the Symptom Checklist 90, the Beck Depression Inventory, and a Bereavement Questionnaire which sought information about the parent, the child, the rest of the family, and the relationship between them. It was found that the parents continued to grieve intensely and had higher than expected levels of psychiatric symptoms as well as increased health complaints. Some parents were more at risk for problems in the bereavement period. Those with unstable families who had ambivalent relationships with their children and whose children were perceived to have had problems at the time of the accident, had more guilt and increased psychiatric symptoms. Parents who had prior bereavement experiences seem to have been protected from higher levels of distress. Additionally, being a mother, losing a daughter, losing children who live at home, losing children born earlier in the birth order, and losing children in single car, single driver accidents seems to portend a more difficult bereavement.

313,Optimistic explanatory style as a moderator of the association between negative life events and suicide ideation.,"Hirsch, Jameson K.; Wolford, Karen; Lalonde, Steven M.; Brunk, Lisa; Parker-Morris, Amanda","BACKGROUND: Individuals experiencing negative and potentially traumatic life events are at increased risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors; however, suicidal outcomes are not inevitable. Individuals who attribute negative life events to external, transient, and specific factors, rather than internal, stable, and global self-characteristics, may experience fewer deleterious outcomes, including suicidal behavior. AIMS: This study examines the moderating effect of explanatory style on the relationship between negative life experiences and suicide ideation in a college student sample. METHODS: A total of 138 participants (73 \% female) were recruited from a rural, Eastern college and completed a self-report psychosocial assessment. RESULTS: Optimistic explanatory style mitigates the influence of negative and potentially traumatic life events on thoughts of suicide, above and beyond the effects of hopelessness and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Beliefs about the origin, pervasiveness, and potential recurrence of a negative life event may affect psychological outcomes.

315,The relations of temperament and emotion self-regulation with suicidal behaviors in a clinical sample of depressed children in Hungary,"Tamas, Zsuzsanna; Kovacs, Maria; Gentzler, Amy L.; Tepper, Ping; Gadoros, Julia; Kiss, Eniko; Kapornai, Krisztina; Vetro, Agnes; Tams, Z.; Kovacs, Maria; Gentzler, Amy L.; Tepper, Ping; Gdoros, J.; Kiss, Eniko; Kapornai, Krisztina; Vetr","Although major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with suicidal behaviors, some depressed individuals are not suicidal and others evidence various forms of suicidality. We thus investigated whether aspects of temperament and self-regulation of dysphoria represent risk factors for DSM-IV suicidality (recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation, suicidal plan, and suicide attempt) in depressed youths. Using a sample of children with MDD (N = 407; ages 7-14 years), recruited from clinical sites across Hungary, we tested the hypotheses that: (a) suicidality is related to higher levels of trait negative emotionality as well as more maladaptive and fewer adaptive regulatory responses to dysphoria and (b) as the severity of suicidal behavior increases, levels of trait negative emotionality and dysfunctional emotion regulation also increase. We also explored if other aspects of temperament relate to suicidality. Children's DSM-IV diagnoses were based on semi-structured interviews and best-estimate psychiatric consensus. Parents independently provided ratings of their children's temperament, and children separately completed an inventory of emotion regulation (ER). Using multivariate models, we failed to confirm the hypothesized relations of negative trait emotionality and suicidality, but confirmed that high maladaptive and low adaptive ER response tendencies increase the odds of suicidal behaviors, above and beyond the risk posed by depressive illness severity. Unplanned interaction terms between temperament dimensions (other than negative emotionality) and ER suggested that at some high-extremes of temperament, ER has no impact on suicidality but in their absence, adaptive ER lowers the risk of suicidality. The practical implications of the findings are discussed. \textcopyright 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",2007.0,10.1007/s10802-007-9119-2,YYQI4BG7,0,behavior,316

This study evaluated the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and culturally adapted CBT (CA-CBT) in treating depressed Chinese-American adults. Methods: This RCT treated 50 Chinese Americans who met criteria for major depression and sought treatment at community mental health clinics. Screening of participants began in September 2008, and the last assessment was conducted in March 2011. Participants were stratified by whether they were already taking antidepressants when they first came to the clinic and randomly assigned to 12 sessions of CBT or CA-CBT. The study did not influence regular prescription practices. The primary outcomes were dropout rates and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores at baseline, session 4, session 8, and session 12. Results: Participants in CA-CBT demonstrated a greater overall decrease in depressive symptoms compared with participants in CBT, but the groups had similarly high depression rates at week 12. Differences in dropout rates for the two groups approached, but did not meet, statistical significance (7 \% , CA-CBT; 26 \% , CBT). Conclusions: Chinese Americans entered this study with very severe depression. Participants in both CBT and CA-CBT demonstrated significant decreases in depressive symptoms, but the majority did not reach remission. Results suggest that these short-term treatments were not sufficient to address such severe depression and that more intensive and longer treatments may be needed. Results also indicate that cultural adaptations may confer additional treatment benefits. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",,,QTM297H6,0,behavior,318
318,Deficits in cognitive flexibility induced by chronic unpredictable stress are associated with impaired glutamate neurotransmission in the rat medial prefrontal cortex,"Jett, J. D.; Bulin, S. E.; Hatherall, L. C.; McCartney, C. M.; Morilak, D. A.","Deficits in cognitive flexibility, the ability to modify behavior in response to changes in the environment, contribute to the onset and maintenance of stress-related neuropsychiatric illnesses, such as depression. Cognitive flexibility depends on medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) function, and in depressed patients, cognitive inflexibility is associated with hypoactivity and decreased glutamate receptor expression in the mPFC. Rats exposed to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) exhibit compromised mPFC function on the extradimensional (ED) set-shifting task of the attentional set-shifting test. Moreover, CUS-induced ED deficits are associated with dendritic atrophy and decreased glutamate receptor expression in the mPFC. This evidence suggests that impaired glutamate signaling may underlie stress-induced deficits in cognitive flexibility. To test this hypothesis, we first demonstrated that blocking NMDA or AMPA receptors in the mPFC during ED replicated CUS-induced deficits in naive rats. Secondly, we found that expression of activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) mRNA, a marker of behaviorally induced glutamate-mediated plasticity, was increased in the mPFC following ED. We then showed that CUS compromised excitatory afferent activation of the mPFC following pharmacological stimulation of the mediodorsal thalamus (MDT), indicated by a reduced induction of c-fos expression. Subsequently, in vivo recordings of evoked potentials in the mPFC indicated that CUS impaired afferent activation of the mPFC evoked by MDT stimulation, but not the ventral hippocampus. Lastly, glutamate microdialysis showed that CUS attenuated the acute stress-evoked increase in extracellular glutamate in the mPFC. Together, these results demonstrate that CUS-induced ED deficits are associated with compromised glutamate neurotransmission in the mPFC.",2017.0,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2017.01.017,8WPAXMNC,0,additional,319

A sample of 170 urban adults completed self-report measures. Women were significantly more likely to experience sexual assault and domestic violence compared to men, and they were significantly less likely to experience a robbery or mugging, being threatened with a weapon, or witnessing a death or assault compared to men. Also, women were more likely than men to meet criteria for probable post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression after controlling for covariates and trauma level.

320,Sleep duration and hypertension are not associated in the elderly,,"Several large studies have shown that both short and long average sleep durations increase the risk of hypertension in adults. We investigated whether sleep duration is also associated with hypertension in the elderly. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 5058 participants of the population-based Rotterdam Study, aged 58 to 98 years. Blood pressure was measured at the research center. Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure of ≥160 mm Hg and/or a diastolic blood pressure of ≥100 mm Hg or current use of antihypertensive medication. In all of the participants, sleep duration was assessed by self-report. In a subsample of 975 subjects, it was additionally measured with actigraphy, a validated method that infers wakefulness and sleep from the presence or absence of limb movement. After adjustment for age and gender and additionally for body mass index, smoking, depressive symptoms, sleep medication use, diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, and stroke, none of the odds ratios (varying from 0.54; 95 \% CI: 0.27 to 1.08; to 1.19; 95 \% CI: 0.89 to 1.58) reflected a significant association between sleep duration and hypertension, whether measured by self-report or actigraphy.

Roy; Rovner, Barry W.; McGwin, Gerald, Jr.; Owsley, Cynthia; Barker, Lawrence; Crews, John E.; Saaddine, Jinan B.","IMPORTANCE: This study provides further evidence from a national sample to generalize the relationship between depression and vision loss to adults across the age spectrum. Better recognition of depression among people reporting reduced ability to perform routine activities of daily living due to vision loss is warranted. OBJECTIVES: To estimate, in a national survey of US adults 20 years of age or older, the prevalence of depression among adults reporting visual function loss and among those with visual acuity impairment. The relationship between depression and vision loss has not been reported in a nationally representative sample of US adults. Previous studies have been limited to specific cohorts and predominantly focused on the older population. DESIGN: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2008. SETTING: A cross-sectional, nationally representative sample of adults, with prevalence estimates weighted to represent the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 10 480 US adults 20 years of age or older. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression, as measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale, and vision loss, as measured by visual function using a questionnaire and by visual acuity at examination. RESULTS: In 2005-2008, the estimated crude prevalence of depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire score of \textgreater /=10) was 11.3 \% (95 \% CI, 9.7 \% -13.2 \% ) among adults with self-reported visual function loss and 4.8 \% (95 \% CI, 4.0 \% -5.7 \% ) among adults without. The estimated prevalence of depression was 10.7 \% (95 \% CI, 8.0 \% -14.3 \% ) among adults with presenting visual acuity impairment (visual acuity worse than 20/40 in the better-seeing eye) compared with 6.8 \% (95 \% CI, 5.8 \% -7.8 \% ) among adults with normal visual acuity. After controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, living alone or not, education, income, employment status, health insurance, body mass index, smoking, binge drinking, general health status, eyesight worry, and major chronic conditions, self-reported visual function loss remained significantly associated with depression (overall odds ratio, 1.9 [95 \% CI, 1.6-2.3]), whereas the association between presenting visual acuity impairment and depression was no longer statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Self-reported visual function loss, rather than loss of visual acuity, is significantly associated with depression.

This longitudinal study examined cognitive and affective contributions to the ability to self-inject and adherence to IFN$\beta$-1a over 6 months following initiation of medication. Participants were 101 patients with a relapsing form of MS. Injection self-efficacy expectations, injection anxiety, adherence expectations, method of injection administration, and 6-month adherence to IFN$\beta$-1a were fitted to a path analytic model. Pretreatment injection self-efficacy expectations were significantly related to 6-month adherence. This relation was mediated by the patient's ability to self-inject.

324,Understanding the neural basis of cognitive bias modification as a clinical treatment for depression,"Eguchi, A.; Walters, D.; Peerenboom, N.; Dury, H.; Fox, E.; Stringer, S.","Objective: Cognitive bias modification (CBM) eliminates cognitive biases toward negative information and is efficacious in reducing depression recurrence, but the mechanisms behind the bias elimination are not fully understood. The present study investigated, through computer simulation of neural network models, the neural dynamics underlying the use of CBM in eliminating the negative biases in the way that depressed patients evaluate facial expressions. Method: We investigated 2 new CBM methodologies using biologically plausible synaptic learning mechanisms - continuous transformation learning and trace learning - which guide learning by exploiting either the spatial or temporal continuity between visual stimuli presented during training. We first describe simulations with a simplified 1-layer neural network, and then we describe simulations in a biologically detailed multilayer neural network model of the ventral visual pathway. Results: After training with either the continuous transformation learning rule or the trace learning rule, the 1-layer neural network eliminated biases in interpreting neutral stimuli as sad. The multilayer neural network trained with realistic face stimuli was also shown to be able to use continuous transformation learning or trace learning to reduce biases in the interpretation of neutral stimuli. Conclusions: The simulation results suggest 2 biologically plausible synaptic learning mechanisms, continuous transformation learning and trace learning, that may subserve CBM. The results are highly informative for the development of experimental protocols to produce optimal CBM training methodologies with human participants.",2017.0,10.1037/ccp0000165,S6JIPLRL,0,additional,325
325,Psychiatric comorbidity in patients with chronic daily headache and migraine: A selective overview including personality traits and suicide risk.,"Pompili, Maurizio and","Studies on the prevalence and impact of psychiatric disorders among headache patients have yielded findings that have clarified the relationship between migraine and major affective disorders, anxiety, illicit drug abuse, nicotine dependence, and suicide attempts. Studies in both clinical and community-based settings have demonstrated an association between migraine and a number of specific psychiatric disorders. In large-scale population-based studies, persons with migraine are from 2.2 to 4.0 times more likely to have depression. In longitudinal studies, the evidence supports a bidirectional relationship between migraine and depression, with each disorder increasing the risk of the other disorder. Although a strong association has been demonstrated consistently for migraine and major depression, especially for migraine with aura, there has been less systematic research on the links between migraine and bipolar disorder. This review will focus on the way in which psychiatric disorders decrease the quality of life and result in a worse prognosis, chronicity of the disease, and a worse response to treatment. Short-term pharmaceutical care intervention improves the patients' mental health, but it does not significantly change the number and severity of headaches. The increase in self-efficacy and mental health associated with pharmaceutical care may be instrumental in improving the long-term pharmacotherapy of patients with migraine and headache.

Structural equation modeling revealed that the conceptual model provided an excellent fit to the data. Negative work experiences were positively related to negative work rumination, which was positively related to heavy alcohol use, workday alcohol use, and after work alcohol use. Positive work experiences were positively related to positive work rumination, which was negatively related to heavy alcohol use and after work alcohol use, but was unrelated to workday alcohol use.

We aimed to assess risk factors associated with very acute behavioral crises in adolescents with ASD admitted to a dedicated neurobehavioral unit. We included retrospectively in 2008 and 2009 29 adolescents and young adults with ASD hospitalized for severe challenging behaviors and proposed a guideline (Perisse et al., 2010) that we applied prospectively for 29 patients recruited for the same indications between 2010 and 2012. In total, 58 patients were admitted (n = 70 hospitalizations, mean age = 15.66 (+/- 4.07) years, 76 \% male). We systematically collected data describing socio-demographic characteristics, clinical variables (severity, presence of language, cognitive level), comorbid organic conditions, etiologic diagnosis of the episode, and treatments. We explored predictors of Global Assessment Functioning Scale (GAFS) score and duration of hospitalization at discharge. All but 2 patients exhibited severe autistic symptoms and intellectual disability (ID), and two-thirds had no functional verbal language. During the inpatient stay (mean = 84.3 (+/- 94.9) days), patients doubled on average their GAFS scores (mean = 17.66 (+/- 9.05) at admission vs. mean = 31.4 (+/- 9.48) at discharge). Most common etiologies for acute behavioral crises were organic causes [n = 20 (28 \% ), including epilepsy: n = 10 (14 \% ) and painful medical conditions: n = 10 (14 \% )], environmental causes [n = 17 (25 \% ) including lack of treatment: n = 11 (16 \% ) and adjustment disorder: n = 6 (9 \% )], and non-ASD psychiatric condition [n =33 (48 \% ) including catatonia: n = 5 (7 \% ), major depressive episode: n = 6 (9 \% ), bipolar disorder: n = 4 (6 \% ), schizophrenia: n = 6 (9 \% ), other/unknown diagnosis: n = 12 (17 \% )]. We found no influence of age, gender, socio-economic status, migration, level of ID, or history of seizure on improvement of GAFS score at discharge. Severity of autism at admission was the only negative predictor (p \textless .001). Painful medical conditions (p = .04), non-ASD psychiatric diagnoses (p = .001), prior usage of specialized ASD care programs (p = .004), functional language (p = .007), as well as a higher number of challenging behaviors upon admission (p = .001) were associated with higher GAFS scores at discharge. Clinical severity at admission, based on the number of challenging behaviors (r = .35, p = .003) and GAFS score (r = -.32, p = .008) was correlated with a longer inpatient stay. Longer hospitalization was however correlated (r = .27, p = .03) with higher GAFS score at discharge even after adjustment for confounding factors. Challenging behaviors among adolescents with ASD may stem from diverse risk factors, including environmental problems, comorbid acute psychiatric conditions, or somatic illness such as epilepsy or acute pain. The management of these behavioral challenges requires a unified, multidisciplinary approach.

A.","BACKGROUND: Whereas a number of studies have suggested that parental loss is associated with increased risk for major depression (MD), much less is known about possible gender differences, diagnostic specificity and the time course of the impact of loss. METHOD: First-onsets for MD and alcohol dependence (AD) were assessed at personal interviews in 5070 twins from same-sex (SS) and 2118 from opposite-sex (OS) twin pairs ascertained from a population-based registry. Cox Proportional Hazard (PH) and Non-Proportional Hazard (NPH) models, examining first onsets of MD and AD, were used with twins from SS pairs and conditional logistic regression for OS pairs. Parent-child separations prior to age 17 were divided into death and separation from other causes. RESULTS: The PH assumptions of constant increased risk were rejected for the impact of loss on risk for MD but not for AD. NPH models found significantly increased risk for MD after both death and separation with the risk lasting much longer for separations. For AD, the PH model found significantly increased risk after parental separation but not death. In both SS and OS twin pairs, no sex differences were seen in the impact of parental loss on risk for MD whereas the association between separation and risk for AD was significantly stronger in females than in males. CONCLUSION: Consistent sex differences in the association with parental loss were seen for AD but not MD. The analysis of the time-course of increased risk after loss suggests three different patterns which may reflect different relationships: parental death and MD (return to baseline within approximately 12 years), separation and MD (return to baseline within approximately 30 years) and separation and AD (no change in risk over time).",2002.0,,M5XZEL6S,0,cognitive_additional,333

After discussing important aspects of the contribution of Freud and later writers to the study of obsessional neurosis, the author provides clinical material that shows the patient's tormented relationship to a feared depressed object that was manifested in the transference. Developing her argument, the author suggests that if the analyst does not fully grasp the primitive anxieties of the underlying state of mind she can be prone to enter into an aggressive enactment with the patient's sadistic superego. This kind of enactment may arouse excitement and triumph in the patient, but actually confirms his doubts and fears about the capacity of his object to contain him.

R.","Background: Blackouts‐or periods of alcohol‐induced amnesia for all or part of a drinking event‐have been identified as independent predictors of alcohol‐related harm that may be used to identify individuals who would benefit from intervention. However, little is known about the prevalence and impact of blackouts among Veterans. This study examined blackouts as a moderator of young adult veteran response to a brief, online personalized normative feedback (PNF) intervention for heavy drinking. Methods: Veterans scoring >=3/4 (women/men) on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test completed a baseline and 1‐month assessment as part of a larger intervention trial (N = 571; 83% male; age M = 28.9, SD = 3.3). Participants were randomized to alcohol PNF (n = 285) or a video game attention control (n = 286). Hierarchical regression was used to examine the interaction between intervention condition and blackouts on alcohol‐related outcomes at 1‐month follow‐up. Results: At baseline, 26% of participants reported loss of memory for drinking events in the past 30 days. The interaction between condition and blackouts was significant, such that PNF participants who had experienced blackouts at baseline reported greater decreases in drinking quantity at 1 month than those who had not, and only PNF participants who had experienced baseline blackouts reported a decrease in alcohol problems at follow‐up. Conclusions: PNF appears to be particularly effective for individuals who have experienced alcohol‐induced blackout, perhaps because blackouts prime them for feedback on their alcohol use. While other negative consequences may also prime individuals for behavior change, blackouts are posited as a particularly useful screening tool because they are prevalent among young adults, have a strong association with alcohol‐related harm, and are assessed in widely used clinical measures.

The oil contained 50 μL (one drop) of compound essential oils (lavender [Lavandula angustifolia], sweet orange [Citrus sinensis], and bergamot (Citrus bergamia in a 2:1:1 ratio)], diluted in sweet almond oil to a concentration of 1%. The aromatherapy inhalation group received 30 min of nasal inhalation of 50 μL of the compound essential oils blended in 10 mL of purified water, twice weekly for 8 weeks. The control group received no intervention. OUTCOME MEASURES: The Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form (GDS‐SF) and Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 (PHQ‐9) were used for assessment at pretest, posttest, and 6‐ and 10‐week follow‐ups in all groups. 5‐Hydroxytryptamine (5‐HT) concentration was assessed pretest and posttest. RESULTS: Postintervention, the aromatherapy massage and inhalation groups demonstrated significantly lower GDS‐SF and PHQ‐9 scores than control participants. Compared with the pretest, the GDS‐SF and PHQ‐9 scores for depressive symptoms in both experimental groups remained lower at posttest (8 weeks), 6‐week (14 weeks), and 10‐week (18 weeks) follow‐ups. However, the GDS‐SF and PHQ‐9 scores did not differ among the four time points in the control group. The posttest 5‐HT concentrations in the aromatherapy massage and inhalation groups were increased over pretest values. CONCLUSIONS: Both aromatherapy massage and aromatherapy inhalation may have important implications for intervening depression in older adults.",2018.0,10/gfwz4s,I7Z73JNH,0,additional,338

The following were measured: chronic dizziness, death, hospitalizations, falls, syncope, basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL), depressive symptoms, self-rated health, falls self-efficacy, and social activities. 261 Ss (24 \% ) reported chronic dizziness. Over 1 yr of follow-up, chronic dizziness was not associated with mortality, hospitalization for any reason, or change in basic or instrumental ADL, but was associated with risk of falling and with experiencing syncope. After adjustment for baseline level, chronic dizziness also was associated with worsening of depressive symptoms, self-rated health, falls efficacy, and social activities. The relationship remained significant, after adjustment for potential confounding factors, for self-rated health and falls efficacy, and was of marginal significance for depressive symptoms. Results suggest that the goals of care for older persons with chronic dizziness should be redirected from solely identifying and treating discrete diseases toward reducing the symptoms of chronic dizziness and alleviating the resulting physical, psychological, and social disability.

339,Red blood cell folate is associated with the development of dysplasia and cancer in ulcerative colitis,"Lashner, B. A.","Patients with extensive ulcerative colitis have a high risk of developing colon cancer. The etiology of mucosal dysplasia, a premalignant lesion that is used as a screening test in surveillance programs, is unknown. Previously, a case-control study [Lashner et al. (1989) Gastroenterology 97:255-259] suggested that folate supplementation was associated with a 62 \% reduction in the risk of developing dysplasia or cancer. The current case-control study was performed to obtain a better definition of this risk. All 67 patients with chronic ulcerative pancolitis having surveillance colonoscopy during a 1-year period were entered. There were 6 cases (4 with dysplasia and 2 with cancer) and 61 controls (no cancer or dysplasia). Red blood cell folate, reflecting intermediate-term stores, was a mean of 66.2 ng/ml lower in cases compared to controls. Serum folate, reflecting short-term stores, was not different between groups. Adjusting for confounding effects of age, sex, race, disease duration, and folate supplementation, the risk of dysplasia or cancer was significantly decreased by 18 \% for each 10 ng/ml increase in red blood cell folate (odds ratio 0.82, 95 \% confidence interval 0.68-0.99). Vitamins A, D, and E and carotene were lower in cases than in controls, but no water-soluble vitamin other than red blood cell folate was associated with an increased cancer risk. Depressed red blood cell folate is associated with an increased risk of dysplasia and cancer in patients, with ulcerative colitisd and may be a risk factor for neoplastic transformation.",1993.0,,FEI6L47R,0,cognitive_additional,340
340,How does addressing patient's defenses help to repair alliance ruptures in psychodynamic psychotherapy?: An exploratory study,"Gerostathos, A. and","Interpreting or addressing defenses is an important aspect of psychoanalytic technique. Previous research has shown that therapist addressing defenses (TADs) can produce a positive effect on alliance. The potential value of TADs during the process of alliance rupture and resolution has not yet been documented. We selected patients (n = 17) undertaking a short-term dynamic psychotherapy in which the therapeutic alliance, measured with the Helping Alliance Questionnaire and monitored after each session, showed a pattern of rupture and resolution. Two control sessions (5 and 15) were also selected. Presence of TADs was examined in each therapist interpretation. Compared with control sessions, rupture sessions were characterized by fewer TADs and especially fewer TADs addressing specifically intermediate - essentially neurotic - defenses. Resolution sessions were characterized by more TADs addressing specifically intermediate defenses. This confirms the link between therapist technique and alliance process in psychodynamic psychotherapy.

A.","Introduction: Social scientists have long recognized the important role that neighborhood crime can play in stress-related disease, but very little is known about potential biosocial mechanisms that may link the experience of living in high-crime neighborhoods with depression. Objective: The current study introduces an integrated model that combines neighborhood, genetic, and epigenetic factors. Methods: Hypotheses were tested with a sample of 99 African American women from the Family and Community Health Study (FACHS). Results: Allele variants of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT) interact with neighborhood crime to predict depressive symptoms in a manner consonant with the differential susceptibility perspective. Furthermore, this association is mediated by DNA methylation of the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene. Conclusion: The findings provide support for an integrated model in which changes in DNA methylation, resulting from neighborhood crime, can result in an increase or decrease in gene activity which, in turn, influences depressive symptoms.",2015.0,10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.10.035,F2HL4TJI,0,diathesis,343

He proposes that authentic analysis of transference within the treatment relationship requires close and explicit attention to be paid to considerations of reality, but in a way that does not require the patient to defer to the analyst's view. The author reconsiders certain conceptions of a special psychoanalytic reality, of regression in clinical analysis, and of the nature of free association, suggesting that they tend to discourage the realism necessary to effective psychoanalytic work. In this context, he underlines the importance of ongoing reference to therapeutic outcome as an aspect of reality, and reflects upon the impact of the reality of the analytic treatment setting and the question of termination.",1999.0,,VCWCIKC3,0,psychodynamic,345
345,Is it all about the higher dose? Why psychoanalytic therapy is an effective treatment for major depression.,"Zimmermann, Johannes; Loffler-Stastka, Henriette; Huber, Dorothea; Klug, Gunther; Alhabbo, Sarah; Bock, Astrid; http://orcid.org/Zimmermann","Empirical evidence for the effectiveness of long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (LTPP) in patients with mood disorders is growing. However, it is unclear whether the effectiveness of LTPP is due to distinctive features of psychodynamic/psychoanalytic techniques or to a higher number of sessions. We tested these rival hypotheses in a quasi-experimental study comparing psychoanalytic therapy (i.e., high-dose LTPP) with psychodynamic therapy (i.e., low-dose LTPP) and cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for depression. Analyses were based on a subsample of 77 subjects, with 27 receiving psychoanalytic therapy, 26 receiving psychodynamic therapy and 24 receiving CBT. Depressive symptoms, interpersonal problems and introject affiliation were assessed prior to treatment, after treatment and at the 1-, 2- and 3-year follow-ups. Psychoanalytic techniques were assessed from three audiotaped middle sessions per treatment using the Psychotherapy Process Q-Set. Subjects receiving psychoanalytic therapy reported having fewer interpersonal problems, treated themselves in a more affiliative way directly after treatment and tended to improve in depressive symptoms and interpersonal problems during follow-up as compared with patients receiving psychodynamic therapy and/or CBT. Multilevel mediation analyses suggested that post-treatment differences in interpersonal problems and introject affiliation were mediated by the higher number of sessions, and follow-up differences in depressive symptoms were mediated by the more pronounced application of psychoanalytic techniques. We also found some evidence for indirect treatment effects via psychoanalytic techniques on changes in introject affiliation during follow-up. These results provide support for the prediction that both a high dose and the application of psychoanalytic techniques facilitate therapeutic change in patients with major depression. Key Practitioner Message: 1. Psychoanalytic therapy is an effective treatment for major depression, especially in the long run. 2. The differential effectiveness of psychoanalytic therapy cannot be fully explained by its higher dose. 3. Distinctive features of psychoanalytic technique (e.g., focusing on patients' dreams, fantasies, sexual experiences or childhood memories) may play an important role in establishing sustained therapeutic change.

J.; Yucel, M.; Pantelis, C.","BACKGROUND: There is evidence to suggest that cognitive deficits might persist beyond the acute stages of illness in major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the findings are somewhat inconsistent across the individual studies conducted to date. Our aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing studies that have examined cognition in euthymic MDD patients. METHOD: Following a systematic search across several publication databases, meta-analyses were conducted for 27 empirical studies that compared euthymic adult MDD patients (895 participants) and healthy controls (997 participants) across a range of cognitive domains. The influence of demographic variables and confounding factors, including age of onset and recurrent episodes, was examined. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, euthymic MDD patients were characterized by significantly poorer cognitive functions. However, the magnitude of observed deficits, with the exception of inhibitory control, were generally modest when late-onset cases were excuded. Late-onset cases demonstrated significantly more pronounced deficits in verbal memory, speed of information processing and some executive functions. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive deficits, especially poor response inhibition, are likely to be persistent features, at least of some forms, of adult-onset MDD. More studies are necessary to examine cognitive dysfunction in remitted psychotic, melancholic and bipolar spectrum MDD. Cognitive deficits overall appear to be more common among patients with late-onset depression, supporting the theories suggesting that possible vascular and neurodegenerative factors play a role in a substantial number of these patients.",2013.0,10.1017/S0033291712002085,4IV3P6CT,0,cognitive,348

Epidemiologic and clinical studies of TMD confirm its status as a chronic pain problem. In this report we present results from a randomized clinical trial which compared, at 3- and 12-month follow-ups, the effects of usual TMD treatment on TMD pain and related physical and psychological variables with the effects of a cognitive-behavioral (CB) intervention delivered to small groups of patients before usual TMD treatment began. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a minimal CB intervention followed by dental TMD treatment enhanced the effects of usual clinical dental treatment. A second purpose of the study was to determine whether patients classified as high in somatization and psychosocial dysfunction would respond less favorably to this minimal intervention than would those low in somatization and dysfunction. Patients who participated in the CB intervention followed by usual treatment showed greater long-term decreases in reported pain level and pain interference in daily activities than did patients who received only usual treatment. The benefits of CB intervention were not seen when the CB and UT groups were compared at 3-month follow-up. During the 3-12-month follow-up interval, however, the UT group maintained essentially the same level of improvement in characteristic pain while the CB group continued to improve, as hypothesized. During this same follow-up interval, the CB group also showed a strong trend toward continued improvement in pain interference. Such effects were not observed for depression, somatization, or clinical measures of jaw range of motion. Additionally, as hypothesized, dysfunctional chronic pain patients did not appear to benefit from the brief CB intervention.

RESULTS: Almost 70 \% of the children reported that they worried every now and then. The content of these worries predominantly pertained to school performance, dying and health, and social contacts. An examination of the characteristics of children's main intense worries revealed that these worries occurred on average 2 to 3 days per week, were accompanied by modest levels of interference and anxiety, elicited relatively high levels of resistance, and were rather difficult to control. A minority of the children were found to exhibit symptoms of worry in the pathological range: the percentages of children who met the DSM-III-R criteria of overanxious disorder and generalized anxiety disorder were 4.7 \% and 6.2 \% , respectively. Finally, worry, anxiety, and depression seemed to be strongly related.

The experience exposes these students to challenging circumstances and raises expectations, which consequently increases the risk of psychiatric disorders and may exacerbate pre-existing problems. This study was designed to explore the risk factors of psychological symptoms among freshmen in China. Methods A three-year follow-up study was designed in a sample of Chinese college freshmen. To set up the baseline interviews, subjects from 25 high schools in Beijing were interviewed during the first year in high school. Three years later, we followed up with the 1547 students from 15 of the previously-selected 25 high schools after they had entered universities. Association between potential risk factors and the occurrence of psychological symptoms measured by the Symptoms Check List-90 was evaluated in unconditional logistic regression models with Wald test. Results Among the 1547 interviewed college freshmen in the study, 120 students (7.8 \ \% \ ) manifested at least one psychological symptom. Personality dysfunction (OR=3.655, 95 \ \% \ CI 1.967-6.793), parental rejection (OR=2.619, 95 \ \% \ CI 1.544-4.442), age ≥ 20 (OR=2.578, 95 \ \% \ CI 1.227-5.418), disfavored university (OR=2.054, 95 \ \% \ CI 1.376-3.066), non-first-choice academic major (OR=1.887, 95 \ \% \ CI 1.255-2.837) and no orientation (OR=1.739, 95 \ \% \ CI 1.025-2.951) were determined to be the risk factors of psychological symptoms among the college freshmen in China.

Treating depression directly prior to behavioral weight loss treatment might bolster weight loss outcomes in this population, but this has not yet been tested in a randomized clinical trial. METHODS AND DESIGN: This randomized clinical trial will examine whether behavior therapy for depression administered prior to standard weight loss treatment produces greater weight loss than standard weight loss treatment alone. Obese women with major depressive disorder (N = 174) will be recruited from primary care clinics and the community and randomly assigned to one of the two treatment conditions. Treatment will last 2 years, and will include a 6-month intensive treatment phase followed by an 18-month maintenance phase. Follow-up assessment will occur at 6-months and 1- and 2 years following randomization. The primary outcome is weight loss. The study was designed to provide 90 \ \% \ power for detecting a weight change difference between conditions of 3.1 kg (standard deviation of 5.5 kg) at 1-year assuming a 25 \ \% \ rate of loss to follow-up. Secondary outcomes include depression, physical activity, dietary intake, psychosocial variables and cardiovascular risk factors. Potential mediators (e.g., adherence, depression, physical activity and caloric intake) of the intervention effect on weight change will also be examined. DISCUSSION: Treating depression before administering intensive health behavior interventions could potentially boost the impact on both mental and physical health outcomes.

To enhance the therapeutic effect of a psychologic intervention, the specific disorders or pain-related beliefs that contributed to poor outcome should be identified. We therefore determined whether specific psychologic disorders (ie, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder) or health-related beliefs (ie, self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing, fear of movement) are associated with poor outcome after knee arthroplasty. We conducted a cohort study of 140 patients undergoing knee arthroplasty at two hospitals. Patients completed a series of psychologic measures, provided various sociodemographic data, and were followed for 6 months. Patients were dichotomized to groups with either a favorable or a poor outcome using WOMAC pain and function scores and evidence-based approaches. After adjusting for confounding variables, we found pain catastrophizing was the only consistent psychologic predictor of poor WOMAC pain outcome. No psychologic predictors were associated consistently with poor WOMAC function outcome. An intervention focusing on pain catastrophizing seems to have potential for improving pain outcome in patients prone to catastrophizing pain. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level I, prognostic study.

Multivariate analyses of each construct revealed significant differences between the three groups on instrumental activities and coping skills, with more depressed individuals reporting lower levels of functioning and less support. An analysis of the second issue revealed that depressed pain patients showed a greater tendency to drop out of treatment. Outcome did not vary with depression among treatment completers.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of behavioral and cognitive resources-active coping and self-efficacy, respectively-as mediators of the relationship between acculturative stress and depression among a sample of Latina/o adults (N = 469). Multiple mediator analysis indicated that active coping partially mediated the relationship between acculturative stress and depression symptom severity. The indirect relationship of acculturative stress to depression symptom severity through self-efficacy was not significant. The results suggest that acculturative stress directly relates to Latino psychological adjustment, and lower behavioral active coping partially accounts for this relationship. Results are discussed in the context of culturally based stress and coping models, wherein the relationship between stressors and subsequent psychological adjustment is influenced by the degree of fit between stressor demands and individuals' resources.

362,Long-term comparison of brief versus unlimited psychodynamic treatments with children and their parents.,"Smyrnios, K. X.; Kirkby, R. J.; Kx, Smyrnios; Rj, Kirkby","Thirty children and their parents were assigned randomly to either time-unlimited or time-limited (12 sessions) psychodynamically oriented treatments or to a minimal-contact control group. All groups showed significant improvements from pretest to posttest. Comparisons between groups at posttest on parental measures of family functioning showed that changes reported by the minimal-contact control group were significantly greater than those of the time-unlimited group. When assessments from pretest to 4-year follow-up were compared, all groups improved significantly on therapist measures of goal attainment, but only the minimal-contact control group reported significant improvements on severity of target problems and measures of family functioning. The results of this study suggest that long-term therapy does not necessarily provide more effective therapy.

363,Impulsivity and risk for mania: towards greater specificity.,"Johnson, Sheri L.; Carver, Charles S.; Mule, Serena; Joormann, Jutta","BACKGROUND: Impulsivity is elevated among people diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and recent evidence suggests that impulsivity can predict onset among those at risk for the disorder. Impulsivity, though, is a broad construct. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to examine whether some aspects of impulsivity are more correlated with risk for mania than others. We hypothesized that risk for mania would be related specifically to difficulties controlling impulsive responses to emotions. DESIGN AND METHODS: Undergraduates (N = 257) completed a large battery of measures of emotion-relevant and non-emotional forms of impulsivity, along with a well-validated measure of risk for mania, the Hypomanic Personality Scale (HPS). RESULTS: Analyses examined correlations of impulsivity scales with the HPS, and partial correlations controlling for lifetime tendencies towards depressive symptoms and current symptoms of alcohol abuse, both of which relate to impulsivity and often co-occur with mania. After controlling for these measures, risk for mania remained correlated with measures of impulsive responses to positive emotions, but not with difficulties in following through or with impulsivity in the context of general distress emotions. CONCLUSIONS: Although impulsivity is a major concern among those at risk for mania and those diagnosed with mania, difficulties may be especially evident during positive affective states, and other forms of impulsivity may be less related to mania risk. Discussion focuses on limitations and future directions. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Impulsivity is correlated with risk for mania. Mania risk appears tied to tendencies towards impulsive action, particularly during positive affective states. Mania risk was not significantly correlated with other non-emotional forms of impulsivity. A better understanding of what aspects of impulsivity are problematic in bipolar disorder could guide more refined interventions.",2013.0,10.1111/j.2044-8341.2012.02078.x,BGGBTEE4,0,personality,364

The aim of this study was to examine whether perceived control could predict changes in the evolution of psychological distress in breast cancer patients at stages I or II. One hundred and one women were assessed on five occasions: one week after surgery, and again 1, 3, 6 and 12 months later, using the Mental Adjustment to Cancer (MAC) Scale, a Self-Efficacy Scale, the Personal Competence Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Profile of Mood Sates (POMS), and the EORTC questionnaire of quality of life. Latent growth curve (LGC) model analysis was used to test the relationship between perceived control and psychological distress in a longitudinal, 1-year study. The results showed that perceived control increases linearly and that distress also decreases linearly. Moreover, the evolution of distress can be predicted from the initial value and the rate of change of perceived control. This close relationship between perceived control and psychological distress was found to be independent of the evolution of the physical state. These findings suggest that perceived control could be used as an early predictor of psychological adjustment to illness.",2009.0,10.1007/s10865-008-9180-5,KEPQ6XM2,0,behavior,365
365,"What is the relationship between health, mood, and mild cognitive impairment?","Yates, J. A.; Clare, L.; Woods, R. T.","Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) often co-exists with mood problems, and both cognitive functioning and mood are known to be linked with health. This study aims to investigate how health, mood, and cognitive impairment interact. Health is often assessed using a single proxy measure, but the use of a range of measures can provide a more informative picture and allows for combination into a comprehensive measure of health. We report an analysis of data from the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study Wales (CFAS Wales, N = 3,173), in which structured interviews with older people captured measures of cognition, mood, and health. Each measure of health was assessed independently in relation to cognition and mood, and then all measures were combined to form a latent health variable and tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). SEM confirmed the association between health and cognition, with depression acting as a mediator. All measures of health were individually associated with levels of anxiety and depression. Participants reporting mood problems were less likely to engage in physical activity and more likely to report poor or fair health, have more comorbid health conditions, use more services, and experience difficulties with instrumental activities of daily living. Perceived health was associated with cognitive status; participants with MCI were more likely to report fair or poor health than participants who were cognitively unimpaired. Careful intervention and encouragement to maintain healthy lifestyles as people age could help to reduce the risk of both mood problems and cognitive decline.",2017.0,10/f9ghrj,PHAK6VUB,0,additional,366

A new UK-designed measure, the Attachment Style Interview (ASI), has potential for cross-cultural use as a risk marker for maternal disorder. AIMS: To establish there liability of the ASI across centres, its stability over a 9-month period, and its associations with social context and major or minor depression. METHOD: The ASI was used by nine centres antenatally on 204 women, with 174 followed up 6 months postnatally. Interrater reliability was tested and the ASI was repeated on a subset of 96 women. Affective disorder was assessed by means of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. RESULTS: Satisfactory interrater reliability was achieved with relatively high stability rates at follow-up. Insecure attachment related to lower social class position and more negative social context. Specific associations of avoidant attachment style (angry-dismissive or withdrawn) with antenatal disorder, and anxious style (enmeshed or fearful) with postnatal disorder were found. CONCLUSIONS: The ASI can be used reliably in European and US centres as a measure for risk associated with childbirth.

However, whether emotion regulation specific to an event highly central for an individual's identity is predictive of depressive symptoms has not been examined. Nonclinical participants (N = 220) reported the extent to which they employed a selection of emotion regulation strategies when recalling low- and high-centrality events. Dispositional emotion regulation and depressive symptoms were also assessed. A 7-week follow-up was conducted. High-centrality events were associated with more emotion regulation efforts. Greater brooding and expressive suppression in relation to high-centrality memories predicted concurrent depressive symptoms after controlling for event valence and dispostional emotion regulation. Effects were absent for low-centrality memories. Emotion regulation in response to high-centrality memories did not predict depressive symptoms at follow-up beyond baseline depressive symptoms. Overall, the findings showed that maladaptive emotion regulation in response to memories of high-centrality events is important for explaining depressive symptomatology.",2018.0,10.1016/j.beth.2017.11.002,45YSZWKJ,0,additional,368
368,A Problem Solving Based Intervention for Facilitating Return-to-work Among People Suffering From Common Mental Disorders,Nct,"Problem solving based intervention involving the workplace has shown promising effects on return‐to‐work among persons with common mental disorders. A key element is cooperation between the person on sick leave, the participant's employer and health care professionals. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects of a problem solving based intervention in the Swedish primary health care system on an employed population on sick leave due to common mental disorders. Cluster randomized controlled trial. The investigators hypothesize that: Participants who have undergone the work‐related problem solving based intervention will have fewer total days on sick leave than the participants who receive treatment as usual at 18 months. Participants who receive the work‐related problem solving based intervention will have fewer recurrent periods of sick leave than the participants who receive treatment as usual at 18 months. Participants who receive the work‐related problem solving therapy intervention will score better on the secondary outcomes than the participants in the control group. Population: Employed, aged 18 ‐ 59, on short‐term sick leave (min. 2 ‐ max. 12 weeks) due to common mental disorders. Intervention: Work‐related problem solving based intervention in addition to treatment as usual. The intervention will be given by rehabilitation coordinators on max. five occasions and includes: making an inventory of problems and/or opportunities related to return‐to‐work; identifying the support needed to implement the solutions; a meeting with the person on sick leave, his/her employer and the rehabilitation coordinator to discuss solutions; making an action plan and evaluation. Control: The control group will receive care as usual (i.e. cognitive behavioral therapy and/or medical treatment, and meeting with a rehabilitation coordinator if this is a part of care as usual at the primary health care centre). A total of 220 persons on sick leave and 30 rehabilitation coordinators will be included. Primary outcome: total number of days on sick leave at 18 months after baseline. A parallel process evaluation will be conducted to examine: to what extent it is possible to implement problem‐solving therapy according to the protocol; the relationship between the key elements of problem‐solving intervention and the effect outcome; how the participants perceive the intervention.",2017.0,,EWUEGDRV,0,additional,369

D.; Myers, L.; Ivan, C.; Williams, L.","Objective: An acute stroke may serve as a major life event that disrupts health‐related quality of life. We examined psychosocial and demographic factors related to functioning and well‐being after stroke among patients discharged from two health care systems: Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and a Joint Commission Stroke Center. Methods: We enrolled 258 participants into a randomized controlled trial to evaluate a stroke self‐management program which targeted functional recovery and risk factor management. All participants completed written consent and a baseline assessment which included demographics, depressive symptoms, self‐efficacy, stroke specific, health‐related quality of life (SSQoL) and psychosocial factors. We conducted multivariate analyses to evaluate factors related to baseline SSQoL using a social cognitive framework. Results: We enrolled our sample, on average, within 81.5 days after hospital discharge for stroke/TIA. Our sample included 19% women with an average age of 61.7 (10.8) years. The average NIH stroke scale score was 3.0 indicating minor stroke. Across the total and subdomains of SSQoL, self‐efficacy to manage stroke health and symptoms was associated with overall better SSQoL (0.16, p<0.0001), social role functioning (0.12, p < 0.01), family role functioning (0.16, p<0.0003), and work role functioning (0.31, p<0.0001). Depressive symptoms were significantly related to poorer SSQoL across all subdomains; however distance walked in a mobility test was not significantly related. Optimism was related to total SSQoL (p<.07) and perceived energy (p<0.02). Demographics were not significantly related to SSQoL in the multivariate models. Conclusions: As social cognitive theory suggests, self‐efficacy to manage symptoms and health after stroke and a sense of optimism for recovery are significantly related to greater stroke specific, health‐related quality of life shortly after hospital discharge for stroke. Post stroke programs which target building self‐efficacy and providing optimism for recovery may enhance SSQoL.

AIM: This paper is a report of study of parent, infant and environmental correlates of mothers' and fathers' perceptions of their parenting self-efficacy. BACKGROUND: Many parents are not confident in their ability to be good parents. Parenting self-efficacy is important for parents' sense of well-being, is a possible predictor of parenting practices and might be an indicator of risk. However, very little evidence exists on factors that influence fathers' perceptions of parenting, or comparisons between the parents. METHODS: The data were collected by questionnaire in 2006-2007 in two hospitals with a convenience sample of Finnish-speaking parents (N = 1300 families) during the first postpartum week. Multiple-birth and early-discharge parents were excluded. The response rate for mothers was 66 \% (n = 863) and for fathers 40 \% (n = 525). Comparisons were made by percentages and means. Statistical significance was determined by Generalized Estimating Equations models and one-way anova. Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients were used to determine correlations, and multiple regression analysis to clarify the effect size. RESULTS: Mothers scored higher than fathers on parenting self-efficacy. Parity, self-concept, depressive symptoms and state of mind on discharge contributed to parenting self-efficacy. Experiences of childbirth and life change correlated with mothers', but not with fathers', parenting self-efficacy. Perceptions of infant, family functioning, health and advice from personnel were major contributory factors. CONCLUSION: Assessments of parenting self-efficacy are recommended to identify at-risk groups and at-risk parents. More research is recommended to look into the effect of rooming-in, feeding practices, fathers' presence and social support from personnel and parenting self-efficacy and to evaluate risk scales for at-risk parents. Parent attributes had a greater effect on mothers' parenting self-efficacy, while environmental attributes had a greater effect on fathers' parenting self-efficacy. At-risk parents can be supported by conducting face-to-face discussions about significant topics.",2009.0,10.1111/j.1365-2648.2009.05113.x,QPUWIQAT,0,behavior,376

The aim of the present study was to examine the interplay of the BDNF Val66Met and the serotonin transporter promoter (5-HTTLPR) polymorphisms in moderating the impact of early-life adversity on BDNF plasma concentration and depressive symptoms. Participants were taken from an epidemiological cohort study following the long-term outcome of early risk factors from birth into young adulthood. In 259 individuals (119 males, 140 females), genotyped for the BDNF Val66Met and the 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms, plasma BDNF was assessed at the age of 19 years. In addition, participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Early adversity was determined according to a family adversity index assessed at 3 months of age. Results indicated that individuals homozygous for both the BDNF Val and the 5-HTTLPR L allele showed significantly reduced BDNF levels following exposure to high adversity. In contrast, BDNF levels appeared to be unaffected by early psychosocial adversity in carriers of the BDNF Met or the 5-HTTLPR S allele. While the former group appeared to be most susceptible to depressive symptoms, the impact of early adversity was less pronounced in the latter group. This is the first preliminary evidence indicating that early-life adverse experiences may have lasting sequelae for plasma BDNF levels in humans, highlighting that the susceptibility to this effect is moderated by BDNF Val66Met and 5-HTTLPR genotype. \textcopyright 2013.",2013.0,10.1016/j.euroneuro.2012.09.003,8P5ITCTW,0,diathesis,378

The generalized groups also showed earlier age at onset and higher scores on measures of depression, fear of negative evaluation, and social anxiety and avoidance than did the nongeneralized group. APD criteria of general timidity and risk aversion were more frequently endorsed by social phobics with APD.

Depressed/anxious MS patients exhibited more neuroticism, less extroversion, less agreeableness, and less conscientiousness than mentally healthy MS patients and normal controls. In contrast, nondepressed/nonanxious MS patients' core personality traits did not substantially differ from normal controls.

Consecutive tinnitus patients without socially disabling hearing loss were recruited if they fulfilled risk criteria for developing severe refractory tinnitus based on a screening procedure with established validity. Thirty-seven patients participated in the group psychotherapy and were compared to patients (n=38) not receiving group therapy, who were primarily recruited to participate in a placebo-controlled study of the effects of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Changes in the severity of tinnitus, anxiety and depression were the main outcomes. Assessments were performed at entry, after 12 weeks treatment, and for the psychotherapy group only, at follow-up three months after the intervention period. Between-group comparisons of change scores over 12 weeks showed no difference between treatment groups. Comparisons within the groups revealed no benefits at the end of the intervention period, but at follow-up a significant improvement in anxiety (p \textless 0.01) was recorded for the psychotherapy group. The findings suggest that short-term group psychotherapy in severe refractory tinnitus is beneficial in terms of anxiety reduction. Group psychotherapy may also contribute to a raised awareness of the existence of a close association between emotional/physical arousal and tinnitus suffering.

Mastery also was a moderator of the association between PDF and life satisfaction. In older persons with a decreasing mastery, PDF was associated with a significant decrease on life satisfaction; this effect was not observed in older persons with stable or increasing mastery. Discussion: This study suggests that coping resources are of importance in explaining associations between persistent health decline and decreasing well-being. Stable or improving mastery even proves to protect older persons with PDF from decreasing well-being.Therefore, it may be of importance to develop interventions for older persons aimed at maintaining or improving psychological coping resources when health declines.",2009.0,,9ENKB7YD,0,behavior,385

While there has been a strong movement toward exclusively biological explanations for mental illness, psychiatric nurses must balance the biological with intrapsychic or interpersonal explanations. In this case, the S's intermittent depressed moods could be traced to intrapsychic or interpersonal triggers. When the S tried drug therapy, one of his most successful trials occurred while he was on a placebo. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",,,DYG5R3KK,0,psychodynamic,386

R.; Niculescu, A. B.","Women are under-represented in research on suicidality to date. Although women have a lower rate of suicide completion than men, due in part to the less-violent methods used, they have a higher rate of suicide attempts. Our group has previously identified genomic (blood gene expression biomarkers) and clinical information (apps) predictors for suicidality in men. We now describe pilot studies in women. We used a powerful within-participant discovery approach to identify genes that change in expression between no suicidal ideation (no SI) and high suicidal ideation (high SI) states (n=12 participants out of a cohort of 51 women psychiatric participants followed longitudinally, with diagnoses of bipolar disorder, depression, schizoaffective disorder and schizophrenia). We then used a Convergent Functional Genomics (CFG) approach to prioritize the candidate biomarkers identified in the discovery step by using all the prior evidence in the field. Next, we validated for suicidal behavior the top-ranked biomarkers for SI, in a demographically matched cohort of women suicide completers from the coroner's office (n=6), by assessing which markers were stepwise changed from no SI to high SI to suicide completers. We then tested the 50 biomarkers that survived Bonferroni correction in the validation step, as well as top increased and decreased biomarkers from the discovery and prioritization steps, in a completely independent test cohort of women psychiatric disorder participants for prediction of SI (n=33) and in a future follow-up cohort of psychiatric disorder participants for prediction of psychiatric hospitalizations due to suicidality (n=24). Additionally, we examined how two clinical instruments in the form of apps, Convergent Functional Information for Suicidality (CFI-S) and Simplified Affective State Scale (SASS), previously tested in men, perform in women. The top CFI-S item distinguishing high SI from no SI states was the chronic stress of social isolation. We then showed how the clinical information apps combined with the 50 validated biomarkers into a broad predictor (UP-Suicide), our apriori primary end point, predicts suicidality in women. UP-Suicide had a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 82 \% for predicting SI and an AUC of 78 \% for predicting future hospitalizations for suicidality. Some of the individual components of the UP-Suicide showed even better results. SASS had an AUC of 81 \% for predicting SI, CFI-S had an AUC of 84 \% and the combination of the two apps had an AUC of 87 \% . The top biomarker from our sequential discovery, prioritization and validation steps, BCL2, predicted future hospitalizations due to suicidality with an AUC of 89 \% , and the panel of 50 validated biomarkers (BioM-50) predicted future hospitalizations due to suicidality with an AUC of 94 \% . The best overall single blood biomarker for predictions was PIK3C3 with an AUC of 65 \% for SI and an AUC of 90 \% for future hospitalizations. Finally, we sought to understand the biology of the biomarkers. BCL2 and GSK3B, the top CFG scoring validated biomarkers, as well as PIK3C3, have anti-apoptotic and neurotrophic effects, are decreased in expression in suicidality and are known targets of the anti-suicidal mood stabilizer drug lithium, which increases their expression and/or activity. Circadian clock genes were overrepresented among the top markers. Notably, PER1, increased in expression in suicidality, had an AUC of 84 \% for predicting future hospitalizations, and CSNK1A1, decreased in expression, had an AUC of 96 \% for predicting future hospitalizations. Circadian clock abnormalities are related to mood disorder, and sleep abnormalities have been implicated in suicide. Docosahexaenoic acid signaling was one of the top biological pathways overrepresented in validated biomarkers, which is of interest given the potential therapeutic and prophylactic benefits of omega-3 fatty acids.

It begins with a review of affect-based models of addiction that address conditioning, affect motivational, and neurobiological mechanisms and then describes the role of NA and emotion regulation in the initiation and maintenance of cigarette smoking. Next, the role of emotion regulation, coping skill deficits, depression, and anxiety sensitivity in explaining the relationship between NA and smoking relapse are discussed. We then review recent models of affect regulation, including emotional intelligence, reappraisal and suppression, and emotional acceptance, and describe implications for substance abuse and smoking cessation interventions. Finally, we point out the need for further investigations of the moderating role of individual differences in response to NA in the maintenance of nicotine dependence, and controlled randomized trials testing the efficacy of acceptance-based interventions in facilitating smoking cessation and relapse prevention.",2007.0,,WAEBGAJS,0,behavior,388

In this naturalistic prospective study, 149 patients with affective, anxiety, substance use, and other disorders were interviewed shortly after entering treatment, which included psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or both. Follow-up interviews were conducted 6 and 12 months later. Attachment styles, DSM-III-R PDs, and symptoms were assessed using structured interviews and consensus ratings. At intake, borderline, avoidant, and dependent PD features correlated consistently with symptom severity and secure attachment correlated inversely with two of four symptom scales. Secure attachment was linked with greater relative improvement in global functioning and a more benign course of anxiety symptoms over 6 months. Borderline PD features predicted less relative improvement of depressive symptoms over 6 months. These findings clarify the relations between attachment styles and PD features and they point to potential mediators of treatment response.",2001.0,,J8XB62F4,0,personality,389

M.; Cadman, J.","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a debilitating mental health disorder, occurring in 1–2 \% of children and adolescents. Current evidence-based treatments produce promising rates of remission; however, many children and youth do not fully remit from symptoms. The current study explored predictors of treatment response to a group cognitive-behavioural treatment program for pediatric OCD (N=43). Higher levels of child depression and parental rejection at baseline were found to be associated with higher OCD symptoms at post-treatment. Family accommodation was found to be associated with OCD symptom severity at 12-months follow-up. Further, children who were classified as treatment responders at 12-months follow-up had fewer depressive symptoms at baseline than non-responders at 12-months. Results indicate that child depression and adverse family factors may contribute to poorer treatment response for children and youth with OCD. This finding suggests current treatments should be refined for these young people in order to better suit their individual needs.",2016.0,,B6M7IYFN,0,cognitive,390

C.","Objective: To explore the relationships between detection, treatment, and outcome of depression in the primary care setting, based upon results from the Michigan Depression Project (MDP). Methods: A weighted sample of 425 adult family practice patients completed a comprehensive battery of questionnaires exploring stress, social support, overall health, health care utilization, treatment attitudes, self-rated levels of stress and depression, along with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III (SCID), which served as the criterion standard for diagnosis. A comparison sample of 123 depressed psychiatric outpatients received the same assessment battery. Family practice patients received repeated assessment of depressive symptoms, stress, social support, and health care utilization over a period of up to 60 months of longitudinal follow-up. Results: The central MDP findings confirm that significant differences in past history, severity, and impairment exist between depressed psychiatric and family practice patients, that detection rates are significantly higher for severely depressed primary care patients, and that clinicians use clinical cues such as past history, distress, and severity of symptoms to 'detect' depression in patients at intermediate and mild levels of severity. As well, there is a lack of association between detection and improved outcome in primary care patients. Conclusion: These results call into question the assumption that 'depression is depression' irrespective of the setting and physician, and they are consistent with a model of depressive disorder as a subacute or chronic condition characterized by clinical parameters of severity, staging, and comorbidity, similar to asthma. This new model can guide further investigation into the epidemiology and management of mood disorders in the primary care setting.",1997.0,,M97QNLEI,0,diathesis,391
391,On the difficulty of making a mutative interpretation.,"Caper, R.","Beginning with Strachey's formulation of the mutative interpretation as the vehicle of the therapeutic action of psychoanalysis, the author considers what makes a mutative interpretation difficult for the analyst. He concludes that this difficulty stems from a relationship of mutual projective identification between patient and analyst, which produces an atmosphere antagonistic to analysis. By viewing the analytic dyad as a group of two, it is possible to relate this anti-analytic atmosphere to Freud's and Bion's theories of group mentality. The author also concludes that Strachey's 'auxiliary superego' is indistinguishable in practice from the analyst's ego, since it is concerned only with 'real and contemporary' events, and suggests that our understanding of what is specific to the therapeutic action of psychoanalysis would be simplified and improved if we replaced Strachey's terms 'auxiliary superego' and 'mature superego' with 'ego'. A successful mutative interpretation is a victory of ego over superego; this process requires that the analyst free himself from the intellectual deterioration that the fusion of superegos has produced; and this accomplishes one of the purposes of analysis: to help the patient think and feel what is true.",1995.0,,G4H3ZGZ3,0,psychodynamic,392

A microanalysis of the nonverbal dimensions of the analytic exchanges that Ringstrom offers is used to illustrate how affective experience can be attended and coconstructed on a subsymbolic process register carried on kinesthetic, somatic, and acoustic dimensions that may or may not be transduced to symbolic expression for mutative analytic impact to have occurred.

The present study sought to replicate and extend these findings in a sample of 142 outpatients (mean age 43.69 yrs) with a primary diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder. After statistically controlling for the higher order effect of neuroticism, the AS fear of cognitive dyscontrol facet was found to be a significant predictor of severity of depressed mood. However, further analysis provided strong evidence that the effect of this AS facet is mediated by rumination over depressed mood. Results are discussed in the context of depression sensitivity, a proposed cognitive structure that may underlie the cognitive process of rumination over depression symptoms.

Dangers of a patient's compliance and idealization of the analyst, associated with the analyst's enacting mutative attitudes, are not inevitable. Deliberate enactment of role relationships and provision of affective experiences can be compatible with current emphasis on authenticity and irreducible subjectivity. Role playing is inevitable in all human interactions. A case of a 31-yr-old, Asian-American man illustrates how an analyst's choice to be more openly playful is no more unauthentic than is limiting self-destructive acting out despite hostile feelings toward a patient. Whether an analyst follows a theory of technique based on resistance analysis or on deliberate and strategic nurturance, authenticity is critical.

Therefore, efforts to design and implement effective cessation programs for this ever-growing special population are warranted. The present study assessed the effects of a cell phone intervention (CPI) on hypothesized mediators (i.e., changes in depression, anxiety, social support, and self-efficacy) demonstrated to influence cessation outcomes in other populations. Ninety-five participants from an inner-city AIDS clinic were randomized to receive either the CPI or recommended standard of care (RSOC) smoking cessation treatment. Participants randomized to the RSOC group (n=47) received brief advice to quit, a 10-week supply of nicotine patches, and self-help materials. Participants randomized to the CPI group (n=48) received RSOC components plus a series of eight proactive counseling sessions delivered via cell phones. A series of regression analyses (linear and logistic) was used to assess the relationships between treatment group, the hypothesized mediators, and biochemically confirmed smoking cessation outcomes. Results indicated that the CPI group experienced greater reductions in anxiety and depression, and increases in self-efficacy compared with the RSOC group. Further, changes in depression, anxiety, and self-efficacy weakened the association between treatment group and cessation outcome. The mediator hypothesis, however, for social support was rejected, as the difference score was not significantly associated with treatment group. These results suggest that the efficacy of the CPI is at least partially mediated by its ability to decrease symptoms of distress while increasing self-efficacy.

M.; Mayer, A. R.; Bogenschutz, M. P.; Tonigan, J. S.; Wilcox, C. E.","Purpose: Individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) have altered brain activation during Strooplike tasks, whichmeasure cognitive control. However, few studies have explored the relationship between Stroop tasks and AUD severity. Additionally, although impaired cognitive control is associated with deficits in emotion regulation, the relationship between brain activation during a non-emotional Stroop and emotionality in AUD has not been investigated. Methods: 34 treatment-seeking participants with AUD enrolled in a clinical trial of prazosin (age 40 × 11, female n = 12) also underwent a multisensory Stroop task during fMRI (Mayer 2012) prior to initiating treatment. Percent signal change (PSC) estimates were calculated using deconvolution analysis in AFNI (details in Mayer 2013; 33 Hz). Paired t-tests were performed [Incongruent (I) vs. Congruent (C)] and corrected formultiple comparisons for the whole brain using 3dClustsim (alpha <0.05, individual voxel p < 0.005). PSC for I and C were extracted fromsignificant clusters and their difference score was used for all subsequent analyses (I-C). Results: Significantly greater activation for I relative to C was observed in the cerebellum, left temporal gyrus (TG), and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). I-C in cerebellum was correlated with drinks per drinking day (DPDD) at time of the scan (rho = 0.346, p = 0.045) as well as scores on the Affective Lability Scale (ALS) (rho = 0.554, p = 0.001), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (rho = 0.511, p = 0.002), Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) (rho = 0.462, p = 0.007), Perceived Stress Scale (rho = 0.522, p = 0.002), and PROMIS anxiety (rho = 0.506, p = 0.002), PROMIS anger (rho = 0.390, p = 0.023) and PROMIS depression (rho = 0.617, p < 0.001) scales. I-C in TG correlated with PROMIS depression (rho = 0.443, p = 0.009) and BDI (rho = 0.378, p = 0.027). I-C in DLPFC correlated with PROMIS depression (rho = 0.353, p = 0.040). Furthermore, I-C in cerebellum was an independent predictor of most emotional measures, correcting for 90 day DPDD, 7 day total drinks, AUDIT, and years since AUD onset (e.g. ALS, I-C beta = 0.551, p = 0.013). Conclusions: Brain activation during a non-emotional Stroop task is related to both AUD severity and emotionality and deserves further exploration as a treatment target in AUD.

Therefore, screening patients to help identify and evaluate potential psychosocial difficulty is arguably an important consideration for BEEC Services. OBJECTIVE: To screen paediatric BEEC patients for a range of general psychosocial difficulties in a multi-disciplinary out-patient clinic setting. STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional evaluation was conducted between April 2012 and July 2013. Families attending BEEC multi-disciplinary out-patient clinics were asked to complete a range of standardised psychosocial questionnaires, including the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core and Family Impact Module), the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), the Paediatric Index of Emotional Distress (PI-ED), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). 108 children attended clinic of which 80 (74.1 \% ) patients and their parents/carers completed some or all of the questionnaires. The mean patient age was 8.41 years (SD = 4.46, range = 1-18 years). There were more boys (N = 50, 62.5 \% ) and the majority had a diagnosis of classic bladder exstrophy (N = 51, 63.8 \% ), followed by primary epispadias (N = 22, 27.5 \% ) and cloacal exstrophy (N = 7, 8.7 \% ). RESULTS: Mean total scores fell within the average/normal range on all questionnaires used (See table below). However, variation around these means was high. Age, gender and diagnosis were found to significantly influence certain questionnaire responses with older-age groups, males, and those with classic bladder exstrophy particularly at risk across some domains. The children/adolescents self-reported better health related quality of life (HRQoL) scores than published results for a range of paediatric chronic health conditions. Differences between parent and child responses on both the PedsQL and SDQ favoured a more positive response on the child self-report questionnaire but were not statistically significant. DISCUSSION: Mean scores on the measures used suggest a relatively optimistic picture of general psychosocial well-being, especially for HRQoL, in the BEEC population studied. Positive HRQoL outcomes have recently been reported for BEEC paediatric populations. Our results reflect this trend with better mean HRQoL scores than paediatric patients with a range of other chronic health conditions. However, this optimism is cautious given the limitations of this evaluation study and the high variation around the means. Limitations included the small sample size (especially for patients with cloacal exstrophy), the lack of a control group, the limited sensitivity of generic questionnaires in respect of BEEC-specific issues, and the low mean age of patients in the study. Future screening programmes may wish to consider measuring BEEC-specific variables (e.g. satisfaction with genital appearance/function); collecting information on medical aspects, such as continence, pubertal stage and frequency/timing of medical intervention; and asking both parents/carers (where possible) to complete the questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS: Screening questionnaire responses were used in conjunction with clinical psychology consultations to evaluate a range of psychosocial aspects in BEEC paediatric patients. Whilst mean scores on the measures used suggest a relatively optimistic picture, certain individual scores did fall within the clinical ranges, highlighting the potential need for further assessment. Developmentally tailored consultations with a clinical psychologist can provide detailed information around questionnaire responses and further assess BEEC specific aspects.",2015.0,10.1016/j.jpurol.2014.10.013,LNG7SILQ,0,cognitive_additional,407
407,Prevalence of depressive symptoms in Japanese male patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"Hayashi, Y.; Senjyu, H.; Iguchi, A.; Iwai, S.; Kanada, R.; Honda, S.; Ozawa, H.","Aim: The objective of this study was to utilize commonly applied tools, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - Depression subscale (HADS-D) and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), to screen for depressive symptoms in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Furthermore, we sought to identify whether differences existed in the prevalence of depressive symptoms as assessed by CES-D and HADS-D, and predictors of depressive symptoms. Methods: The presence of depressive symptoms in 80 outpatients and 51 inpatients with stable COPD was assessed using the CES-D and HADS-D. Data regarding sex, educational level, body mass index, smoking index and pulmonary function were obtained to evaluate their independent contribution as predictors of depressive symptoms. Results: The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 29.8 \% based on CES-D and 40.5 \% based on HADS-D. A MacNemar test of COPD severity and analysis of the results of depressive symptoms based on CES-D and HADS-D revealed significant differences. Logistic regression analysis suggested that 'severity' is a predictor of depressive symptoms as assessed by CES-D, whereas 'body mass index', 'education level' and 'setting' were predictors of depressive symptoms as assessed by HADS-D. Conclusions: The prevalence of depressive symptoms differed when assessed with CES-D and HADS-D. The reasons behind this difference include the fact that HADS-D frequently detected depressive symptoms in patients with mild COPD as well as a tendency for HADS-D to be strongly influenced by education levels. In contrast, the severity of COPD was reflected in CES-D. It is possible that prevalence of depressive symptoms differs in accordance with the applied screening tool. \textcopyright 2011 Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology.",2011.0,10.1111/j.1440-1819.2010.02171.x,S6K4HF4C,0,cognitive_additional,408

409,Improving mental health in health care practitioners: Randomized controlled trial of a gratitude intervention.,"Cheng, Sheung-Tak; Tsui, Pui Ki; Lam, John H. M.","Objective: Chronic occupational stress is common among health care practitioners, with potential impacts on personal mental health and staff turnover. This study investigated whether directing practitioners' attention to thankful events in work could reduce stress and depressive symptoms. Method: A double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in 5 public hospitals with follow-up to 3 months posttreatment. One hundred two practitioners were randomly assigned into 3 conditions: gratitude, hassle, and nil-treatment. Those with scheduled long leaves were excluded. Participants in the gratitude and hassle group wrote work-related gratitude and hassle diaries respectively twice a week for 4 consecutive weeks. A no-diary group served as control. Depressive symptoms (primary outcome) and perceived stress (secondary outcome) were collected at baseline, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up. Intent-to-treat analyses were performed with mixed-effects regression. Results: Significant Treatment x Time interaction effects were found for the gratitude intervention, whether it was compared with control or hassle; the general pattern was a decline in stress and depressive symptoms over time, but the rate of decline became less pronounced as time progressed. Hassle and control were basically indistinct from each other. Relative to control, the gratitude group reported lower depressive symptoms (-1.50 points; 95 \% CI [-2.98, -0.01]; d = -0.49) and perceived stress (-2.65 points; 95 \% CI [-4.00, -1.30]; d = -0.95) at follow-up. Results for the comparison between gratitude and hassle were similar. Conclusion: Taking stock of thankful events is an effective approach to reduce stress and depressive symptoms among health care practitioners.

METHODS: 265 people aged >/=50 were randomly assigned to a stepped care programme plus usual care (n=131) or usual care only (n=134). Supervised occupational therapists, social workers, and psychologists from low vision rehabilitation organisations delivered the stepped care programme, which comprised watchful waiting, guided self help based on cognitive behavioural therapy, problem solving treatment, and referral to a general practitioner. The primary outcome was the 24 month cumulative incidence (seven measurements) of major depressive dysthymic and/or anxiety disorders (panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, and generalised anxiety disorder). Secondary outcomes were change in symptoms of depression and anxiety, vision related quality of life, health related quality of life, and adaptation to vision loss over time up to 24 months' follow-up. STUDY ANSWER AND LIMITATIONS: 62 participants (46%) in the usual care group and 38 participants (29%) from the stepped care group developed a disorder. The intervention was associated with a significantly reduced incidence (relative risk 0.63, 95% confidence interval 0.45 to 0.87; P=0.01), even if time to the event was taken into account (adjusted hazard ratio 0.57, 0.35 to 0.93; P=0.02). The number needed to treat was 5.8 (3.5 to 17.3). The dropout rate was fairly high (34.3%), but rates were not significantly different for the two groups, indicating that the intervention was as acceptable as usual care. Participants who volunteered and were selected for this study might not be representative of visually impaired older adults in general (responders were significantly younger than non-responders), thereby reducing the generalisability of the outcomes. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Stepped care seems to be a promising way to deal with depression and anxiety in visually impaired older adults. This approach could lead to standardised strategies for the screening, monitoring, treatment, and referral of visually impaired older adults with depression and anxiety.

K.; Davis-Karim, A.; Phibbs, C. S.; Forman, S. D.; Thase, M.; Georgette, G.; Beale, T.; Pittman, D.; et al.","Background: Evaluation of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for treatment‐resistant major depression (TRMD) in Veterans offers unique clinical trial challenges. Here we describe a randomized, double‐blinded, intent‐to‐treat, two‐arm, superiority parallel design, a multicenter study funded by the Cooperative Studies Program (CSP No. 556) of the US Department of Veterans Affairs. Methods: We recruited medical providers with clinical expertise in treating TRMD at nine Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers as the trial local investigators. We plan to enroll 360 Veterans diagnosed with TRMD at the nine VA medical centers over a 3‐year period. We will randomize participants into a double‐blinded clinical trial to left prefrontal rTMS treatment or to sham (control) rTMS treatment (180 participants each group) for up to 30 treatment sessions. All participants will meet Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, 4 th edition (DSM‐IV) criteria for major depression and will have failed at least two prior pharmacological interventions. In contrast with other rTMS clinical trials, we will not exclude Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or history of substance abuse and we will obtain detailed history regarding these disorders. Furthermore, we will maintain participants on stable anti‐depressant medication throughout the trial. We will evaluate all participants on a wide variety of potential predictors of treatment response including cognitive, psychological and functional parameters. Discussion: The primary dependent measure will be remission rate (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD24) <= 10), and secondary analyses will be conducted on other indices. Comparisons between the rTMS and the sham groups will be made at the end of the acute treatment phase to test the primary hypothesis. The unique challenges to performing such a large technically challenging clinical trial with Veterans and potential avenues for improvement of the design in future trials will be described.

Similar to findings of previous studies, bulimic symptom remission at end of treatment was predicted by baseline degree of bulimic symptom severity but not by depressive symptomatology or perfectionism. After these variables were controlled for, both pretreatment ratings of desire to discontinue bulimic behaviors and expected success significantly added to prediction of treatment outcome. The primary variable found to predict longer term outcome was symptom remission at the end of treatment and at the 1-month follow-up.

414,A Group Cognitive-Behavioural Intervention to Prevent Depression Relapse in Individuals Having Recently Returned to Work: protocol and Feasibility,"Lecomte, T.; Corbière, M.","Workplace depression is one of the major causes for sick leave and loss of productivity at work. Many studies have investigated factors predicting return to work for people with depression, including studies evaluating return to work programs and organizational factors. Yet, a paucity of studies have targeted the prevention of depressive relapses at work, even though more than half of those having had a depression will have a depressive relapse in the near future.Objectives This article describes a research protocol involving a novel group intervention based on cognitive behavioural principles with the aim to optimize return to work and diminish risk of depressive relapses.Method This pilot study follows a randomized controlled trial design, with half the participants (N=25) receiving the group intervention and the other half (N=25) receiving usual services. The theoretical and empirical underpinnings of the intervention are described, along with a detailed presentation of the intervention and of the study's objectives. The group intervention consists of 8 sessions whereby Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) principles and techniques are applied to the following themes: (1) Coping with stress at work; (2) Recognizing and modifying my dysfunctional beliefs linked to work; (3) Overcoming obstacles linked to work functioning and maintaining work; (4) Negotiating needed work adjustments with the support of the immediate supervisor; (5) Finding my strengths and competencies related to work; (6) Accepting criticism and asserting myself appropriately at work; (7) Uncovering my best coping strategies for work.Results Qualitative information pertaining to the first two cohorts' participants' subjective appreciation of the group experience revealed that the intervention was perceived as very useful by all, with group support, namely harmony and interpersonal support, as well as CBT strategies being mentioned specifically.Conclusion Finally, the potential relevance of the group intervention will be brought forward.",2017.0,,MVNXEG8E,0,additional,415
415,Cognitive impairment in affective psychoses: a meta-analysis.,"Bora, Emre; Yucel, Murat; Pantelis, Christos","It has recently been suggested that cognitive impairment should be included in the diagnostic criteria of schizophrenia. One of the main arguments in support of this suggestion has been the hope that cognitive impairment can help distinguish schizophrenia from bipolar disorder (BD). However, recent evidence shows that cognitive deficits occur in BD and persist beyond euthymia. Further, mood disorders with psychotic features might be expected to manifest greater cognitive impairment, which further complicates the potential to differentiate these disorders. The goal of the current meta-analysis was to examine the magnitude and characteristics of cognitive impairments in affective psychoses (AP). A systematic search of the existing literature sourced 27 studies that met the inclusion criteria. These studies compared cognitive performances of 763 patients with AP (550 BD and 213 major depressive disorder) and 1823 healthy controls. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were used to examine the effects of moderator variables. Meta-analyses of these studies showed that patients with AP were impaired in all 15 cognitive tasks with large effect sizes for most measures. There were no significant differences between the magnitude of impairments between the BD and major depressive disorder groups. The largest effect size was found for symbol coding, stroop task, verbal learning, and category fluency, reflecting impairments in elementary and complex aspects of attentional processing, as well as learning and memory. In general, the pattern of cognitive impairments in AP was similar to reported findings in euthymic patients with BD, but relatively more pronounced.",2010.0,10.1093/schbul/sbp093,9ARRRVG8,0,cognitive,416
416,Baseline-dependency of nicotine effects: A review,"Perkins, K. A.","'Rate-dependency', a founding observation of behavioral pharmacology, generally indicates that effects of drugs will be inversely related to the rate of operant responding under control conditions (i.e. decrease in high-rate behaviors and increase in low-rate behaviors). 'Baseline-dependency' encompasses rate-dependency and extends this notion to other drug effects, including those assessed by means other than 'rate' (such as subjective mood self-reports). Although little human research has specifically investigated the effects of nicotine as a function of baseline level of responding, a number of studies suggest baseline-dependent differences in the influence of nicotine on behavioral and cognitive task performance and on subjective mood responses. Results of many animal studies also are very consistent with these observations. Baseline-dependency, perhaps, is most clearly demonstrated in comparisons between groups selected on the basis of specific characteristics (e.g. high vs low 'trait hostility'), or within subjects as a result of acute environmental manipulations (e.g. high vs low 'stress' task). Moreover, baseline-dependency of the effects of nicotine may have broader applicability in explaining individual differences in vulnerability to nicotine dependence, particularly among those with psychiatric disorders (e.g. depression). While individual differences in responses to nicotine may be due to differences in pharmacological sensitivity to nicotine, as commonly assumed, they also may be due partly to individual and situationally determined differences in baseline level of responding on the measure of interest. Consideration of the conditions under which baseline-dependent effects of nicotine are observed may clarify both individual difference and situational influences on responses to nicotine.",1999.0,,C26UB8UT,0,diathesis,417
417,An intervention for reducing secondary traumatization and improving professional self-efficacy in well baby clinic nurses following war and terror: A random control group trial,"Berger, Rony; Gelkopf, Marc","Background: Due to the terror and war-related situation in Israel, well baby clinic nurses dealing with a large number of traumatized and highly distressed infants, toddlers and their parents have become overwhelmed. Objectives: (1) Assess the level of secondary traumatization, including lack of compassion satisfaction, burnout and compassion fatigue of well baby clinic nurses living under chronic threat of war and terror. (2) Assess the efficacy of an intervention aimed at providing well baby clinic nurses with psycho-educational knowledge pertaining to stress and trauma in infants, young children and parents. This intervention provides the nurses with screening tools for identifying children and parents at risk of developing stress-related problems and equips them with stress management techniques. Design: Quasi-random control trial. Setting: The intervention took place in Israel, in war (North) and terror (South) affected areas. Participants: Ninety well baby clinic nurses from the most war and terror affected areas in Israel were approached, 42 were randomly assigned the experimental intervention and 38 served as a waiting list group. Methods: The intervention was comprised of 12 weekly 6-h sessions. Each session included theoretical knowledge, experiential exercises based on the nurses' work or personal life experience, and the learning of skills accompanied by homework assignments. Participants were assessed on self-report measures of secondary traumatization, professional self-efficacy, hope, sense of mastery and self-esteem before and after the intervention. Results: (1) Well baby clinic nurses were found to have elevated secondary traumatization levels. (2) Compared to the waiting list group, the intervention group improved significantly on the professional self-efficacy measure as well as reducing the level of secondary traumatization. Furthermore, improvement on all secondary traumatization measures covaried with the improvement on the professional self-efficacy assessments. Based on additional informal reports, the improvement was observed to be clinically significant. Conclusions: Training of medical personnel who work with traumatized children and their families and who may also be under the threat of war and terror is essential to both improving their professional functioning, as well as reducing the vulnerability to secondary traumatization. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2011.0,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2010.09.007,HBGSCIWW,0,diathesis,418
418,Associations Between Interpretation Bias and Depression in Adolescents,"Orchard, F.; Pass, L.; Reynolds, S.","Interpretation biases have been shown to play a role in adult depression and are a target in cognitive behavioural therapy. Adolescence is a key risk period for the development of depression and a period of rapid cognitive and emotional development but little research has investigated the relationship between interpretation biases and depression in adolescents. This study adapted a measure of interpretation bias, the Ambiguous Scenarios Test for Depression, for adolescents and evaluated its reliability and validity. A community sample of 206 young people aged 12–18 years completed a validated measure of depression symptoms (Mood and Feelings Questionnaires) and the adapted Ambiguous Scenarios Test. The Ambiguous Scenarios Test for Depression in Adolescents had good internal consistency and split half reliability. Depression symptoms were associated with participants' ratings of the valence of ambiguous situations and with interpretation biases. Importantly, symptoms of depression and anxiety were independently associated with interpretation bias. This research suggests that interpretation biases can be measured in this age group, that negative interpretation biases exist in adolescents and that these are associated with depression symptoms.",2016.0,,X4DWW4DS,0,behavior,419
419,Inflammation and Improvement of Depression Following Electroconvulsive Therapy in Treatment-Resistant Depression,"Kruse, J. L.; Congdon, E.; Olmstead, R.; Njau, S.; Breen, E. C.; Narr, K. L.; Espinoza, R.; Irwin, M. R.","OBJECTIVE: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the most robust acute treatment for severe major depressive disorder, yet clinical response is variable. Inflammation is associated with depression, especially in women, and levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6 predict response to antidepressant medications. This study evaluated whether markers of inflammation predicted response to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in patients with treatment-resistant depression and to what extent this association differed between men and women. METHODS: In patients (N = 29) who had a current major depressive episode diagnosed using DSM-IV-TR criteria and were scheduled to undergo ECT at an academic referral center, levels of CRP, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha and severity of depressive symptoms (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS]) were prospectively evaluated before ECT treatment, after the second ECT session, and again at the completion of the index treatment series. Data were collected between December 2011 and December 2014. The primary outcome was end-of-treatment MADRS score. RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, higher levels of IL-6 at baseline, but not other inflammatory markers or clinical variables, were associated with lower end-of-treatment MADRS score (P = .01). When stratified by sex, IL-6 remained a significant predictor of end-of-treatment MADRS for women (P = .02) but not men (P = .1), and CRP emerged as a significant predictor for women (P = .04) but not men (P = .66). CRP and IL-6 increased from baseline to the second ECT session (P values < .01) and returned to baseline levels at end of treatment; these changes did not relate to MADRS score over the course of ECT. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of IL-6 prior to ECT treatment may be useful in identifying those depressed patients most likely to benefit from ECT treatment. In contrast, acute changes in IL-6 and CRP may reflect spikes in inflammatory response related to the initiation of seizure therapy, but not mood. Assessment of pretreatment inflammatory biomarkers, especially in women, might be useful in guiding treatment decision-making in treatment-resistant depression.",2018.0,10.4088/JCP.17m11597,CUHBD676,0,additional,420

E.","Objective: The aim of this study was to examine whether the physical and mental components of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) are independent predictors of survival in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Methods: A cohort of 231 outpatients with CHF was followed prospectively for 986 days (median; interquartile range=664-1120). Generic HRQoL was measured with the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36), disease-specific HRQoL was measured with the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, and depression was measured with the self-reported Patient Health Questionnaire. Results: Both generic and disease-specific HRQoL were predictive of survival on univariate analyses. After adjustment for prognostic factors such as age, gender, degree of left ventricular dysfunction, and functional status, only the mental health component of SF-36 and the disease-specific HRQoL remained significant. When depression was included, both measures also lost their predictive power. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the prognostic value of patients' HRQoL reflects confounding with the severity of disease and comorbid depression. \textcopyright 2007 Elsevier Inc.

421,Kleine-Levin Syndrome: An Overview and Relevance to Nursing Practice.,"Arnone, Jacqueline M.; Conti, Richard P.","Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS) is a neuropsychiatric sleep disorder primarily affecting adolescent males. Onset is insidious, idiopathic, and hastened by neurological incident or infection. Typically, the initial onset occurs during the teen years or after the second decade, although cases have been documented in early childhood, adulthood, and senescence. KLS is marked by unexpected debilitating, yet reversible, episodic hypersomnia, with varying recurrence rates; cognitive and behavioral impairment; compulsive eating; and feelings of derealization, hypersexuality, apathy, and depressed mood. Diagnosis is problematic due to the syndrome's rarity, disparity of presenting clinical symptoms, and misdiagnosis. Correct diagnosis can take up to 4 years. The clinical course is approximately 8 to 14 years from initial onset, yet may be longer in the adult form of the disorder. KLS has been shown to impact activities of daily living, usurping an adolescent of his/her social relations with peers, experiences, and time.",2016.0,10.3928/02793695-20160219-07,ZMT2QP45,0,cognitive,422
422,The role of readiness to change in response to treatment of adolescent depression.,"Lewis, Cara C.; Simons, Anne D.; Silva, Susan G.; Rohde, Paul; Small, David M.; Murakami, Jessica L.; High, Robin R.; March, John S.","The effect of readiness to change on treatment outcome was examined among 332 adolescents (46 \% male, 74 \% Caucasian), ages 12 through 17 years (M = 14.6, SD = 1.5), with major depressive disorder who were participating in the Treatment for Adolescents With Depression Study (TADS). TADS is a randomized clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of fluoxetine (an antidepressant medication), cognitive-behavioral therapy, their combination, and a pill placebo. An abbreviated Stages of Change Questionnaire was used to obtain 4 readiness to change scores: precontemplation, contemplation, action, and maintenance. The association between each readiness score and depression severity across 12 weeks of acute treatment for depression, as measured by the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised, was examined. Although treatment response was not moderated by any of the readiness scores, baseline action scores predicted outcome: Higher action scores were associated with better outcome regardless of treatment modality. Furthermore, treatment effects were mediated by change in action scores during the first 6 weeks of treatment, with increases in action scores related to greater improvement in depression. Assessing readiness to change may have implications for tailoring treatments for depressed adolescents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",,,XRZ6LQNS,0,behavior,423

The present review and meta-analysis evaluated the treatment outcomes of patients with BD treated with CBT plus medication and compared these data with the outcomes of those who received standard care alone. Methods: Electronic searches from inception to July 31, 2016, were performed using PubMed, Medline OVID, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CINAHL plus, and PsycINFO. In the extensive electronic literature search, keywords such as ""bipolar disorder,"" ""manic-depressive psychosis,"" ""bipolar affective disorder,"" ""bipolar depression,"" ""cognitive therapy,: ""cognitive-behavioral therapy,"" and ""psychotherapy"" were transformed into MeSH terms, and only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) of relapse rates and Hedges's g, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), for the mean differences in the levels of depression, mania, and psychosocial functioning were calculated. Further subgroup analyses were conducted according to the characteristics of the CBT approaches, patients, and therapists, if the data were available. Result: A total of 19 RCTs comprising 1384 patients with type I or II BD were enrolled in our systematic review and meta-analysis. The main analysis revealed that CBT could lower the relapse rate (pooled OR = 0.506; 95% CI = 0.278 -0.921) and improve depressive symptoms (g = -0.494; 95% CI = -0.963 to -0.026), mania severity (g = -0.581; 95% CI = -1.127 to -0.035), and psychosocial functioning (g = 0.457; 95% CI = 0.106+/-0.809). Conclusions: CBT is effective in decreasing the relapse rate and improving depressive symptoms, mania severity, and psychosocial functioning, with a mild-to-moderate effect size. Subgroup analyses indicated that improvements in depression or mania are more potent with a CBT treatment duration of >= 90 min per session, and the relapse rate is much lower among patients with type I BD.

DESIGN: Two independent, consecutive cohorts of patients (group 1, n = 28; group 2, n = 17) underwent all-night polygraphic sleep recordings and other clinical evaluations during the first and fourth weeks of a 1-month inpatient treatment program within a Veteran Affairs Medical Center. They were reevaluated 3 months following discharge to the community. None were treated with disulfiram or other medications during or after hospitalization. PATIENTS: All subjects were male veterans with primary alcoholism and without significant preexisting, secondary, or comorbid diagnoses such as major medical problems, depression, antisocial personality, or drug addiction. OUTCOME MEASURES: Relapse was defined as any alcohol consumption between discharge from the hospital and 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Ten (36 \% ) of 28 patients in group 1 were Relapsers at 3-month follow-up. Relapsers in group 1 showed significantly shorter Rapid Eye Movement (REM) latency, increased Rapid Eye Movement percent (REM \% ), and increased REM Density during their admission sleep studies compared with Abstainers. To replicate these observations, group 2 was then studied as a validation sample. Six (35 \% ) of 17 patients relapsed. As in group 1, Relapsers had significantly shorter REM latency and increased REM \% compared with Abstainers; REM Density was not significantly different in the Relapsers as compared with Abstainers in group 2. Using a principal components analysis based on these three REM sleep measures to determine REM pressure, three separate discriminant function analyses (DFAs) were calculated: one for each group and one for all patients (n = 45) together. The DFA from group 1 correctly classified 22 (78.6 \% ) of the 28 patients in group 1 and 13 (76.5 \% ) of the 17 patients in group 2 as Relapsers or Abstainers. The DFA from group 2 correctly classified 13 (76.5 \% ) of the 17 patients in group 2 and 23 (82.1 \% ) of the 28 patients in group 1. The DFA formed from both groups together correctly classified 36 (80 \% ) of the 45 patients. When the REM sleep measures at hospital admission and discharge were compared, no statistically significant effect of time was observed. Abstinence and relapse were not consistently related to other clinical measures at the time of hospital admission such as age, duration and severity of alcoholism, marital status, employment, hepatic enzyme levels, cognitive performance, or depression ratings. CONCLUSION: Short REM latency, increased REM \% , and, possibly, increased REM Density at the time of admission to a 1-month inpatient alcohol treatment program predict relapse in nondepressed patients with primary alcoholism by 3 months following hospital discharge.",1994.0,,JRWI7A3U,0,cognitive,425

R.; Fagerlund, B.; Gluud, C.; Mors, O.; Hjorthøj, C.; Nordentoft, M.","OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of five years of specialised early intervention (SEI) treatment for first episode schizophrenia spectrum disorder with the standard two years of SEI plus three years of treatment as usual. DESIGN: Randomised, superiority, parallel group trial with blinded outcome assessment. Randomisation was centralised and computerised with concealed randomisation sequence carried out at an external site. SETTING: Participants were recruited from six OPUS teams in Denmark between 2009 and 2012. OPUS teams provide SEI treatment to all patients diagnosed with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder in Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: 400 participants (51% women) with a mean age of 25.6 (standard deviation 4.3) were randomised to five years of SEI (experimental intervention; n=197) or to two years of SEI plus three years of treatment as usual (control; n=203). INTERVENTIONS: OPUS treatment consists of three core elements‐modified assertive community treatment, family involvement, and social skill training‐with a patient‐case manager ratio of no more than 12:1. For participants randomised to five years of OPUS treatment, the treatment was largely unchanged. Participants randomised to the control group were mostly referred to community health centres after two years of SEI treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES: Follow‐up assessments were conducted five years after start of OPUS treatment. Primary outcome was negative symptoms measured on the scale for assessment of negative symptoms (avolition‐apathy, anhedonia, alogia, and affective blunting). Secondary outcomes were remission of both negative and psychotic symptoms, psychotic symptoms, suicidal ideation, substance abuse, compliance with medical treatment, adherence with treatment, client satisfaction, days in hospital care, and labour market affiliation. RESULTS: Levels of negative symptoms did not differ between the intervention group and control group (1.72 v 1.81 points; estimated mean difference ‐0.10 (95% confidence interval 0.33 to 0.13), P=0.39). Participants receiving five years of OPUS treatment were more likely to remain in contact with specialised mental health services (90.4% v 55.6%, P<0.001), had higher client satisfaction (estimated mean difference 2.57 points (95% confidence interval 1.36 to 3.79), P<0.001), and had a stronger working alliance (estimated mean difference 5.56 points (95% confidence interval 2.30 to 8.82), P=0.001) than the control group. CONCLUSIONS: This trial tests SEI treatment for up to five years for patients with first episode schizophrenia spectrum disorder; previous trials have found treatment effects for programmes lasting from one to three years. The prolonged SEI treatment had few effects, which could be due to the high level of treatment provided to control participants and the late start of specialised treatment.Trial registration Clinicaltrial.gov NCT00914238.",2017.0,,2ESAW37Q,0,additional,426
426,"A psychological comparison of heterosexuals, transvestites, preoperative transsexuals, and postoperative transsexuals.","Beatrice, James","Assessed the psychological functioning of 10 male heterosexuals (aged 28-38 yrs), 10 male transvestites (aged 29-37 yrs), 10 preoperative male transsexuals (aged 27-42 yrs), and 10 postoperative male transsexuals (aged 30-43 yrs), using the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale (TSCS) and the MMPI-Form R. The data indicate that the 4 groups did not significantly differ in terms of self-acceptance as measured by the TSCS. Self-acceptance was immutable despite the adoption of a gender role opposite to one's anatomical sex. In the MMPI profiles, the male heterosexuals did not demonstrate clinically significant dysfunction. The transvestites, although their profiles suggested a trend toward a passive-aggressive personality with paranoid features, also did not demonstrate clinically significant dysfunction. The preoperative transsexuals demonstrated clinically significant findings suggestive of psychological dysfunction ranging from antisocial personality to manic-depressive psychosis, and the postoperative transsexuals were significantly higher than the heterosexuals and transvestites on the clinical scales of Paranoia and Schizophrenia. It is concluded that transsexuals represent the conflicted development of femininity in a male whose personality functioning is severely impaired. These Ss may be at risk for further deterioration of their psychological status if sexually reassigned. The study supports the recent literature, which indicates that sex reassignment surgery for transsexuals is not the treatment of choice.

427,History of vascular disease and mild parkinsonian signs in community-dwelling elderly individuals,"Louis, E. D.; Luchsinger, J. A.","Background: Mild parkinsonian signs (MPS) are commonly found during the clinical examination of older people. These signs could reflect the accumulation of vascular pathological changes in the brain. If the etiology were vascular, one could hypothesize that individuals with MPS would be more likely to have systemic vascular disease than would their counterparts without these signs. Objectives: To examine whether MPS are associated with a history of vascular disease and whether certain MPS (rigidity, changes in axial function) are more strongly associated with a history of vascular disease than are other MPS (tremor). Methods: Evaluation of older people without dementia in Washington Heights-Inwood, northern Manhattan, NY. The presence of vascular diseases was assessed with a structured health interview. Results: Mild parkinsonian signs were present in 375 (16.4 \% ) of 2286 participants without dementia. Diabetes mellitus, heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke were more prevalent in participants with MPS than without MPS, whereas nonvascular diseases (cancer, thyroid disease) were not. In a logistic regression analysis that adjusted for age, sex, education, and depressive symptoms, the number of vascular diseases was associated with MPS (odds ratio, 1.31 [95 \% confidence interval, 1.18-1.46]; P \textless .001). The combination of diabetes mellitus and heart disease increased the odds of MPS by 70 \% and the combination of these with stroke increased the odds by 332 \% . Conclusions: The presence of MPS in elderly individuals might reflect, in part, the accumulation of vascular pathological changes in the basal ganglia or white matter regions caused by preventable vascular diseases. Prospective and pathological studies are needed to further explore this finding. \textcopyright 2006 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.",2006.0,,6ZHL4M6V,0,cognitive_additional,428

H.; Løhaugen, G.; Schumacher, E. M.; Osredkar, D.; Server, A.; Cowan, F. M.; Stiris, T.; Fugelseth, D.; Thoresen, M.","Objectives To examine whether using an amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) severity pattern as an entry criterion for therapeutic hypothermia better selects infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and to assess the time-to-normal trace for aEEG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesion load as 24-month outcome predictors. Study design Forty-seven infants meeting Norwegian therapeutic hypothermia guidelines were enrolled prospectively. Eight-channel EEG/aEEG was recorded from 6 hours until after rewarming, and read after discharge. Neonatal MRI brain scans were scored for summated (range 0-11) regional lesion load. A poor outcome at 2 years was defined as death or a Bayley Scales of Infant-Toddler Development cognitive or motor composite score of <85 or severe hearing or visual loss. Results Three severity groups were defined from the initial aEEG; continuous normal voltage (CNV; n = 15), discontinuous normal voltage (DNV; n = 18), and a severe aEEG voltage pattern (SEVP; n = 14). Any seizure occurrence was 7% CNV, 50% DNV, and 100% SEVP. Infants with SEVP with poor vs good outcome had a significantly longer median (IQR) time-to-normal trace: 58 hours (9-79) vs 18 hours (12-19) and higher MRI lesion load: 10 (3-10) vs 2 (1-5). A poor outcome was noted in 3 of 15 infants with CNV, 4 of 18 infants with DNV, and 8 of 14 infants with SEVP. Using multiple stepwise linear regression analyses including only infants with abnormal aEEG (DNV and SEVP), MRI lesion load significantly predicted cognitive and motor scores. For the SEVP group alone, time-to-normal trace was a stronger outcome predictor than MRI score. No variable predicted outcome in infants with CNV. Conclusions Selection of infants with encephalopathy for therapeutic hypothermia after perinatal asphyxia may be improved by including only infants with an early moderate or severely depressed background aEEG trace.",2017.0,10.1016/j.jpeds.2017.04.041,26Z3UBC8,0,additional,429
429,Interpretation and expectation: The anxiety of influence.,"Raphling, David L.","Interpretations communicate the analyst's assessments of the patient's conflicts, expectations for their resolution, estimation of the patient's potential, and his or her investment in helping the patient realize that potential. Although analysis of unintended interpretive influences facilitates relative neutrality, interpretations contain an implicit system of reward and punishment for conformity to preferred drive-derivative expressions, defenses, and superego attitudes. This conditioning effect of interpretive themes accompanies insight and indicates the analyst's expectations for resolution of symptoms and character manifestations. When analysts' and patients' aims for change coincide, an interpretation is an authoritative statement with which the patient can identify and thus ratify his or her goals.

G.; Porta, Giovanna; Lynch, Frances L.; Iyengar, Satish; Garber, Judy","IMPORTANCE Adolescents whose parents have a history of depression are at risk for developing depression and functional impairment. The long-term effects of prevention programs on adolescent depression and functioning are not known. OBJECTIVE To determine whether a cognitive-behavioral prevention (CBP) program reduced the incidence of depressive episodes, increased depression-free days, and improved developmental competence 6 years after implementation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A 4-site randomized clinical trial compared the effect of CBP plus usual care vs usual care, through follow-up 75 months after the intervention (88 \% retention), with recruitment from August 2003 through February 2006 at a health maintenance organization, university medical centers, and a community mental health center. A total of 316 participants were 13 to 17 years of age at enrollment and had at least 1 parent with current or prior depressive episodes. Participants could not be in a current depressive episode but had to have subsyndromal depressive symptoms or a prior depressive episode currently in remission. Analysis was conducted between August 2014 and June 2015. INTERVENTIONS The CBP program consisted of 8 weekly 90-minute group sessions followed by 6 monthly continuation sessions. Usual care consisted of any family-initiated mental health treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The Depression Symptoms Rating scale was used to assess the primary outcome, new onsets of depressive episodes, and to calculate depression-free days. A modified Status Questionnaire assessed developmental competence (eg, academic or interpersonal) in young adulthood. RESULTS Over the 75-month follow-up, youths assigned to CBP had a lower incidence of depression, adjusting for current parental depression at enrollment, site, and all interactions (hazard ratio, 0.71 [95 \% CI, 0.53-0.96]). The CBP program's overall significant effect was driven by a lower incidence of depressive episodes during the first 9 months after enrollment. The CBP program's benefit was seen in youths whose index parent was not depressed at enrollment, on depression incidence (hazard ratio, 0.54 [95 \% CI, 0.36-0.81]), these effects on developmental competence were mediated via the CBP program's effect on depression-free days. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The effect of CBP on new onsets of depression was strongest early and was maintained throughout the follow-up period; developmental competence was positively affected 6 years later. The effectiveness of CBP may be enhanced by additional booster sessions and concomitant treatment of parental depression.

J.","The present investigation examined anxiety sensitivity (AS) in the relation between emotional nonacceptance (unwillingness to experience unwanted emotions) and mood and anxiety symptoms among Latinos seeking health services at a primary healthcare facility. Participants included 267 adult Latinos (85.4% female; Mage = 38.8 years, SD = 10.7, and 95.9% used Spanish as their first language). Results indicated that emotional nonacceptance was indirectly related to number of mood and anxiety disorders, anxious arousal, social anxiety, and depressive symptoms through AS. The observed effects were evident above and beyond the variance accounted for by gender, age, marital status, educational status, employment status, years living in the United States, and negative affectivity. Using a multiple mediation model revealed that the AS cognitive, physical, and social concerns demonstrated unique incremental explanatory effects (above and beyond the other two AS sub-scales) for depressive, anxious arousal, and social anxiety symptoms, respectively. Thus, specific sub-scales of AS were uniquely related with the expression of particular affective symptom domains. Overall, the present findings suggest that there is merit in focusing further scientific attention on the interplay between nonacceptance and AS in regard to better understanding and intervening to reduce anxiety/depressive vulnerability among Latinos in primary care.",2017.0,10.1007/s10862-017-9592-z,MTCGZ2DB,0,additional,433
433,Association between inflammatory-related disease burden and frailty: Results from the Women's Health and Aging Studies (WHAS) I and II,"Chang, S. S.; Weiss, C. O.; Xue, Q. L.; Fried, L. P.","Frailty is associated with a pro-inflammatory state, which has been characterized by elevated levels of systemic inflammatory biomarkers, but has not been related to the number of co-existing chronic diseases associated with inflammation. We sought to determine the extent to which a higher number of inflammatory-related diseases is associated with frailty and to identify the most common disease patterns associated with being frail in older adults. We performed binomial regression analyses to assess whether a higher count of inflammatory-related diseases increases the probability of frailty using data from the WHAS I and II, companion cohorts composed of 70-79-year-old community-dwelling older women in Baltimore, Maryland (n= 620). An increase of one inflammatory-related disease was associated log-linearly with frailty (Prevalence Ratio (PR) = 2.28, 95 \% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.81-2.87). After adjusting for age, race, education, and smoking status, the probability of frailty remained significant (PR = 1.97, 95 \% CI = 1.52-2.55). In the frail population, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and depressive symptoms (Prevalence = 22.9 \% , 95 \% CI = 14.2-34.8 \% ); CVD and depressive symptoms (21.7 \% , 95 \% CI = 13.2-33.5 \% ); CKD and anemia (18.7 \% , 95 \% CI = 11.1-29.7 \% ); cardiovascular disease (CVD), CKD, and pulmonary disease (10.7 \% , 95 \% CI = 5.2-21.0 \% ); CKD, anemia, and depressive symptoms (8.7 \% , 95 \% CI = 3.9-18.2 \% ); and CVD, anemia, pulmonary disease, and depressive symptoms (5.0 \% , 95 \% CI = 1.6-14.4 \% ) were among the most frequent disease combinations. Their prevalence percentages were significantly higher in the frail versus non-frail women. A higher inflammatory-related disease count, perhaps reflecting a greater pro-inflammatory burden, increases the likelihood of frailty. Shared mechanisms among specific disease combinations may further contribute to this risk. \textcopyright 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",2012.0,10.1016/j.archger.2011.05.020,FGEAVG6G,0,cognitive_additional,434
434,The association of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy people with depressive mood and sense of coherence,"Cohen, M.; Sklair-Tavron, L.; Pollack, S.","Background: Depressive mood exerts a suppressive effect on immune functions, mediated through neuro-immune processes. Research suggests a protective effect of sense of coherence (SOC) on psychological and physical health in face of stressful life events. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is a cellular second messenger that is coupled to certain receptors expressed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). By interfering with the neuro-endocrine-immune axis, depressive mood may induce changes in intracellular cAMP levels in PBMC. Aims of study: To examine a possibble association of SOC, stressful life events during the pevious year, depressive mood, and cAMP levels. Methods: Fifteen male volunteers participated in the study. They completed the SOC and Zung's depression questionnaires and stressful life events inventory. Basic cAMP level and forskolin-stimulated cAMP production were measured in PBMC. Results: Forskolin-stimulated cAMP production was significantly higher in individuals who reported higher depressive mood, more stressful life events, or lower SOC scores. SOC scores explained 40 \% of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production. Basal cAMP levels could not be correlated with psychological scores. Age or education level did not affect forskolin-stimulated or basal cAMP levels. Conclusions: Our data suggest that high forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in PBMC is associated with low SOC, which points to availability ot personal resources for coping with stressful life events. Further examination of the possible mediating role of SOC in relation to depressive mood and neuroimmune functions is needed. \textcopyright 2004 Federation of European Psychophysiology Societies.",2004.0,10.1027/0269-8803.18.4.177,695D6N6Q,0,diathesis,435

K.","Objective: To describe empirically the risky sexual behavior of an at-risk sample of adolescent girls, to assess psychosocial correlates of risky behavior, and to examine the utility of applying a risk and protective model to predicting teens' risky sexual behavior. Method: Participants included 158 African American girls, ages 12 to 19, who were receiving medical care in an adolescent primary care clinic. Teens completed measures of depression, conduct problems, substance use, peer norms, social support, HIV knowledge, sexual self-efficacy, and sexual behavior. Results: Teens in this sample reported high rates of risky sexual behaviors, including early sexual debuts and frequent unprotected sexual encounters with multiple partners. African American girls who reported high rates of substance use and who reported that their peers engaged in risky behaviors also reported engaging in high rates of risky sexual behaviors. Little support was obtained for protective factors (HIV knowledge, social support, sexual self-efficacy) moderating the relations between risk factors and adolescents' risky sexual behavior in this sample. Conclusions: Teens presenting in primary care settings in urban environments seem to be at high risk for HIV, STDs, and substance abuse, and risk reduction strategies should be introduced during the preteen years.

No association was found between the scales and clinical state or level of adjustment at intake or follow-up. In affective disorder patients, no correlation was found between premorbid functioning (a stable characteristic) and scale scores, but moderately large correlations emerged between the scales and clinical state and level of adjustment at both assessment times. These results suggest that schizophrenic and affective disorder patients endorse items on these scales for different reasons.

We also investigated the extent to which four coping styles--problem-focused coping, emotion-focused coping, positive social support, and negative social support--moderated the association between childhood maltreatment and depressive symptoms of the caregivers. DESIGN AND METHODS: Among 1,001 filial caregivers from the 2003-2005 wave of the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, 18.6 \% of respondents reported verbal, physical, or sexual abuse in childhood; 9.4 \% reported neglect in childhood. Ordinary least squares regression models were estimated. RESULTS: Persons who had a history of parental abuse showed significantly more frequent depressive symptoms when providing care to their abusive parent(s) compared with caregivers who had not experienced parental abuse. Those who had been neglected had significantly more frequent depressive symptoms than caregivers who did not report neglect. Additionally, the use of emotion-focused coping was more strongly associated with more frequent depressive symptoms among abused caregivers than among caregivers with no history of abuse.

This secondary analysis examined the moderating effect of baseline depressive symptoms on intervention efficacy. When compared to one session of Tele-MI or standard of care, four sessions of Tele-MI produced greater reductions in sexual risk behavior in participants with subsyndromal depression at baseline but was no more efficacious than the other two conditions for participants with no or elevated baseline depressive symptoms.

The present study was intended to address these issues by examining relationships among remorse, psychopathology, and psychopathy in a sample of adolescent offenders (N = 97) using the theoretically and empirically established framework of guilt and shame (Tangney \& Dearing, 2002). Findings indicated that shame was positively related to behavioral features of psychopathy, whereas guilt was negatively related to psychopathic characteristics more broadly. In addition, shame was positively associated with numerous mental health problems whereas guilt was negatively associated with anger, depression, and anxiety. These results provide empirical support for theory that psychopathy is characterized by lack of remorse (e.g., Hare, 1991), and also underscore shame and guilt as potentially important treatment targets for adolescent offenders.",2015.0,,LKFTNZ7B,0,psychodynamic,441

A longitudinal, descriptive design was used to test the reliability and validity of the Unmet Resource Needs (URN) measure. Item development was based on literature review and preliminary study findings. A stress and coping conceptual model framed the hypotheses. Psychometric testing was based on 6-month postdischarge data (n = 166). Content and structural construct validity, internal consistency reliability through 1 year, and concurrent validity were tested. Change in URN over time was examined. Content validity was supported by floor and ceiling effects less than 5 \% . Principal axis factoring yielded a 12 item, two factor solution reflecting general and technology unmet needs. Internal consistency reliability was satisfactory for the total scale and subscales at all times, excepting the baseline three-item technology scale ( \$ \alpha \$ = .56). Concurrent validity was supported by significant correlations with model constructs (threat, positive problem solving, depression, preparedness; p \textless .01) in the expected direction. Functional status and resource use were not associated with the URN. Repeated measures analysis of variance (n = 123) indicated a significant decrease in unmet needs from baseline to 3, 6, and 12 months postdischarge (p \textless .001). Nevertheless, 42 \% reported one or more unmet needs at year 1. Assessment and counseling on unmet needs is indicated throughout the caregiving trajectory to reduce negative outcomes.

Surveys completed by patients (with corresponding parent reports) seen between January 2012 and December 2016 were included. QOL, anxiety and depression were assessed using the PedsQL, KADS (Kutchers Adolescent Depression Scale), and SCARED (Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders) surveys. Additional variables obtained include presence of ICD (implantable cardioverter defibrillator), genetic testing and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO). Patients were risk stratified into low (0,1 factors) and high (≥2 factors) risk groups using standard risk factors for SCD (family history of HCM, syncope, ventricular tachycardia, abnormal blood pressure response during cardiac stress test, and MRI with late gadolinium enhancement). Risk stratification group scores were compared. Results: There were 108 patients and 69 corresponding parent reports. For patient scores there were no significant differences on total PedsQL (p =0.9), SCARED (p =0.82) or KADS (p= 0.85) between those with and without ICD. Comparison of patients with and without LVOTO ≥30mmHg demonstrated significant differences in the PedsQL social subscale (p=0.02), SCARED (p=0.01) and KADS (p=0.005) scores. There was no significant difference in scores between risk stratified groups. There were no differences between patient and parents' perceptions of QOL, anxiety and depression. Conclusions: LVOTO may be the best predictor of QOL, anxiety and depression in HCM patients <26 years of age. There was no difference in perceived QOL, anxiety, or depression between patients and parents.",2017.0,,48IARV7X,0,additional,443
443,"Psychological and emotional development, intellectual capabilities, and body image in short normal children.","Molinari, E.; Sartori, A.; Ceccarelli, A.; Marchi, S.","It is well established that children with short stature frequently have problems in cognitive development, personality, self-esteem and social relations. This is partly due to the fact that many parents view them as more vulnerable than other children of normal stature and do not allow them to face the normal experiences that correspond to their actual age. The aim of the present study was to assess, through the administration of appropriate psychological tools, a series of psychological and cognitive characteristics [i.e. anxiety, depression, good adjustment, social functioning, feeling of guilt, interpersonal relationship, intelligence quotient (IQ)], as well as variables linked to development of body image, in a group of children suffering from normal growth variants [familial short stature (FSS), no. 10, 4 males/6 females; with constitutional growth delay (CGD), no. 4,4 males; height standard deviation score (HSDS) ranging between -2.4 and -1.9] and in a control group children of normal stature (HSDS between -0.1 and +0.1). Children with short stature significantly differed from normal statured controls as far as Colored Progressive Matrices (CPMs, centiles), IQ (IQ, obtained using the Goodenough test), Good Adjustment (Draw-a-Person index, DAP), Feelings of Guilt (DAP index), Height (as emerges from drawings of the body) are concerned. Significant relationships were found between the height of the subjects (in centiles) and cognitive skills, measured both using CPMs (r=0.408; p=0.017) and Draw-a-Man (DAM) (r=0.359; p=0.037) and between height and feelings of guilt (r=0.325; p=0.027), measured using DAP. CPM scores correlated positively with the Good Adjustment index of DAP (r=0.354; p=0.05) and negatively with Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) (r=-0.609; p=0.01), School Anxiety index (r=-0.427; p=0.05) and Total Anxiety index (r=-0.436; p=0.05) of the Anxiety Scale Questionnaire for the Age of Development, and with 2 indices of DAP, namely, Feelings of Guilt (r=-0.461; p=0.01) and Interpersonal Relationships (Difficulty in Establishing) (r=-0.455; p=0.01). A significant positive correlation was found between the height of the subject and both the measurement of the Body of Drawing 3 (r=0.450, p=0.01) and the measurement of the Body of Drawing 4 (r=0.461, p=0.01), as well as the with the Total Height of Drawing 4 (r=0.464, p=0.01). Higher indices for anxiety, depression, feelings of guilt and difficulty in establishing interpersonal relationships and lower indices for good adjustment were found in children with CGD as compared to subjects with FSS or normal statured children. Although further additional studies on larger samples are needed to confirm these preliminary observations, the present study underlines the importance of psychological support also during the growth and development in short normal children.",2002.0,,RYSFX5H9,0,psychodynamic,444
444,The doctor's wife: mental illness and marital pattern.,"Miles, J. E.; Krell, R.; Lin, T. Y.","It is a clinical impression that physicians' wives present in disproportionately large numbers as psychiatric patients; that in the vast majority severe marital problems are present; and that the marital relationships show a similar pattern. The purpose of this paper is to ascertain whether the latter two impressions have any basis in fact. Accordingly, a random sample of twenty physicians' wives who had been in-patients in the University of British Columbia Health Sciences Centre Hospital during the period March 1, 1969 to May 31, 1973, and whose husbands had been interviewed, was selected. The records were reviewed to obtain personal data, pertinent psychiatric history, diagnosis, the personality of husband and wife and information on the marital relationship. These conclusions emerged: 1. Ninety per cent of the patients had a primary diagnosis of depressive neurosis. 2. Ninety-five per cent of the patients had a secondary diagnosis of personality disorder, hysterical personality and passive-aggressive personality in order of frequency. 3. In 90 per cent of the patients there was a history of suicidal preoccupation or attempt. 4. In 55 per cent of the patients there was a history of significant drug and/or alcohol abuse. 5. The patients were more frequently ward management problems. 6. A common marital pattern was noted: a dependent, histrionic wife and an emotionally detached husband. 7. The cases were characterized by their complexity, severity, long duration and difficulties involving the patient and spouse in an appropriate treatment plan. The authors discuss the implications of this study, particularly its significance in provoking examination of what measures might be utilized for early detection and intervention with those physicians and physician-marriages at risk.",1975.0,10.2190/DDYQ-66T3-AUX4-QBEE,FV39XBFE,0,cognitive_additional,445

448,Duloxetine for management of stress urinary incontinence,"Guay, D. R. P.","Objective: The aim of this article was to review data regarding the efficacy and tolerability of duloxetine, a selective serotonin (S-HT)-norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibitor that has received US Food and Drug Administration marketing approval for the treatment of major depressive disorder and painful diabetic neuropathy, and that has been investigated as a treatment for stress urinary incontinence. Methods: A MEDLINE/PubMed search was conducted to identify English-language study reports. In addition, proceedings of meetings of the International Continence Society, European Association of Urology, American Urological Association, and American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology were reviewed for relevant abstracts (search terms included duloxetine, thiophenes, serotonin uptake inhibitors, adrenergic uptake inhibitors, and stress urinary incontinence). Additional references were obtained from the bibliographies of these sources. Data for the period from 1986 through January 2005 were reviewed. Results: All in vitro and in vivo studies of duloxetine were included. Because both S-HT and NE are involved in the maintenance of urinary continence, duloxetine may have a role in the treatment of urinary incontinence. Duloxetine is primarily eliminated via metabolism, with \textless 1 \% of the parent compound excreted via urine. Duloxetine QD or BID has been found to be significantly superior to placebo in reducing incontinence episode frequency (P \textless 0.001 to P \textless 0.05), increasing the interval between micturitions (P \textless 0.001 to P = 0.004), and improving the condition as measured by patient self- report (P \textless 0.001 to P = 0.028) and incontinence quality-of-life scores (P = 0.002 to P = 0.03). The most problematic adverse events are nausea, dry mouth, constipation, dizziness, and insomnia. Conclusions: Although statistically superior to placebo in efficacy trials, the clinical effects of duloxetine therapy on incontinence are small, suggesting that any benefits to the patient would be modest and must be weighed against the drug's adverse event profile. No comparative efficacy/tolerability data with alpha-receptor agonists (eg, pseudoephedrine) are available. On the basis of available data, duloxetine is a modest, but welcome, advance in the pharmacotherapeutic management of stress urinary incontinence.

449,Attachment in adults: Clinical and developmental perspectives.,"Sperling, Michael B.; Berman, William H.","Reflecting the emerging understanding of the significance of attachment in adult life, this comprehensive volume provides a broad overview of recent research on adult attachment from a diversity of perpectives. Throughout, contributors apply the construct of attachment to a conceptual and empirical understanding of relatedness across the life span. The book opens with an overview of the structure and function of adult attachment. . . . Part II deals with broad theoretical and conceptual questions that affect adult attachment. The role of attachment at various stages of the life cycle is the focus of Part III. In the final section, contributors relate attachment to psychopathology and psychotherapy through studies of suicidal ideation and impulse; parental bonding and depressive disorders; and personality disorders. Representing much of the most current thinking, this volume is valuable for developmental, social, and clinical psychologists, psychotherapists, and psychotherapy researchers.

450,Social connections: Internet prevention of loneliness and depression in first year university students.,"Peters, Hannah Osier","Developing meaningful interpersonal relationships is foundational for psychological health. During the transition to college, first year students are faced with developmental tasks such as forming friendships, and living with peers. Loneliness and depression are common among those who experience lack of social support (Aneshensel \ \& \ Stone, 1982; Medora \ \& \ Woodward, 1986). Given that emerging adults (ages 18-24) have the highest incidence and cumulative rates of depression of any age group (R. C. Kessler et al., 2010; R. C. Kessler et al., 1994; G. L. Klerman \ \& \ Weissman, 1989) and one in ten college students has considered suicide (Jed Foundation2010), prevention efforts are crucial for helping first year university students manage the challenges of transitioning to college. Few interventions target interpersonal skills and development during this transition, and literature searches retrieved no previous internet-based interventions focused on interpersonal functioning for this population. The current study examines the feasibility and efficacy of an on-line psychoeducational prevention program, SocialConnections, which integrates interpersonal skills from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Dialectical Behavior therapy, and Interpersonal Therapy to target developmentally appropriate interpersonal challenges for first semester university students. Students in two freshman dormitories at a large private university were offered SocialConnections (SC) and all students in a third freshmen dormitory were offered an on-line sleep program (Refresh) as a control. Students were assessed at baseline and 10 weeks later at post-assessment on measures of depression, loneliness, empathy, and social skills. Change scores were computed from pre to post test and independent samples t-tests were conducted on all measures. Findings revealed no differences between SC and the control program on the measures of interest, however SC did demonstrate a moderate effect size for those students who were at high risk for depression at baseline (CES-D scores \ \textgreater \ 22). Additionally, SC was well received by students. Thirty six percent of students signed up for SC compared to 24 \ \% \ of the control. Completion rates were high for both programs. Student enjoyment ratings ranged from 3-4 out of 5 stars for each SC session, with roommates and breakups the highest rated (4/5 stars).

452,The association between psychopathology and placebo analgesia in patients with discogenic low back pain.,"Wasan, Ajay D.; Kaptchuk, Ted J.; Davar, Gudarz; Jamison, Robert N.","BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain patients have a high rate of psychopathology, comprised mainly of depression, anxiety, and high levels of neuroticism. We previously found that psychopathology is associated with increased placebo analgesia in this patient group. OBJECTIVE: To better understand this finding in the context of other known predictors of placebo response (such as expectations for relief), we performed a detailed analysis of expectations and other possible covariates. DESIGN: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover-designed trial of intravenous morphine vs. placebo in 60 subjects with chronic low back pain and discogenic abnormalities. Patients were stratified into three groups of psychiatric symptom severity (Low, Moderate, and High), based on composite scores on depression, anxiety for pain, and neuroticism scales. Subjects were given intravenous morphine and placebo in random order on separate visits, and completed serial pain ratings over 3 h at each session. RESULTS: With 20 subjects per group, there were small, but significant differences between groups in baseline pain ratings. No differences were found between groups in age, gender, and radicular pain. Patients with low psychological symptomatology reported 7.7 \% total pain relief with placebo compared with 23.4 \% in the Moderate group and 23.5 \% in the High group (P \textless 0.05). Expectations were not significantly different between groups, but in the High group expectation levels predicted placebo analgesia (P \textless 0.001). Neuropathic pain quality was also a predictor (P \textless 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that high and moderate levels of psychopathology are associated with heightened placebo analgesia in chronic low back pain patients. Expectations were only an influence in the high psychopathology group, and neuropathic pain affects placebo responses. These findings have implications for future research characterizing placebo responders.",2006.0,10.1111/j.1526-4637.2006.00154.x,TL9U32MF,0,cognitive,453
453,The effects of inaccurate expectations on experiences with psychotherapy,"Seligman, L. D.; Wuyek, L. A.; Geers, A. L.; Hovey, J. D.; Motley, R. L.","Inaccurate expectations have been shown to negatively affect patients' experiences with medical treatments; however, much less is known about the effects of inaccurate expectations on patients' experiences with psychotherapy. This may be particularly important at the current time because, while many cultural outlets depict either nondirective or psychodynamic therapy, the majority of empirically supported treatments are guided by cognitive behavioral theory. Two studies examined (1) current expectations for psychological treatment and (2) the effects of accurate versus inaccurate expectations on students undergoing either cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or nondirective therapy for nonclinical academic problems. Results from Study 1 suggest that people presenting for psychotherapy may be unlikely to expect the specific tasks and goals common to many CBTs. Results from Study 2 demonstrate negative effects of inaccurate expectations on affective reactions to treatment regardless of the type of treatment received. The implications for dissemination of empirically supported CBTs are discussed. \textcopyright 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",2009.0,,XJPXMKNY,0,psychodynamic,454

A pilot study of music therapy in the treatment of multiple sclerosis patients.,"Aldridge, D.; Schmid, W.; Kaeder, M.; Schmidt, C.; Ostermann, T.","INTRODUCTION: Neuro-degenerative diseases are, and will remain, an enormous public health problem. Interventions that could delay disease onset even modestly will have a major public health impact. The aim of this study is to see which components of the illness are responsive to change when treated with music therapy in contrast to a group of patients receiving standard medical treatment alone. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty multiple sclerosis patients (14 female, 6 male) were involved in the study, their ages ranging from 29 to 47 years. Ten participants formed the therapy group, and 10 the matched control group matched by age, gender and the standard neurological classification scheme Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Exclusion criteria were pregnancy and mental disorders requiring medication. Patients in the therapy group received three blocks of music therapy in single sessions over the course of the one-year project (8-10 sessions, respectively). Measurements were taken before therapy began (U1), and subsequently every three months (U2-U4) and within a 6-month follow-up without music therapy (U5) after the last consultation. Test battery included indicators of clinical depression and anxiety (Beck Depression Inventory and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), a self-acceptance scale (SESA) and a life quality assessment (Hamburg Quality of Life Questionnaire in Multiple Sclerosis). In addition, data were collected on cognitive (MSFC) and functional (EDSS) parameters. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the music-therapy treatment group and the control group. However, the effect size statistics comparing both groups show a medium effect size on the scales measuring self-esteem (d, 0.5423), depression HAD-D (d, 0.63) and anxiety HAD-A (d, 0.63). Significant improvements were found for the therapy group over time (U1-U4) in the scale values of self-esteem, depression and anxiety. In the follow-up, scale values for fatigue, anxiety and self-esteem worsen within the group treated with music therapy. DISCUSSION: A therapeutic concept for multiple sclerosis, which includes music therapy, brings an improvement in mood, fatigue and self-acceptance. When music therapy is removed, then scale scores worsen and this appears to intimate that music therapy has an influence.",2005.0,10.1016/j.ctim.2005.01.004,HBNNB4TC,0,cognitive,455
455,Measuring AIDS stigmas in people living with HIV/AIDS: The Internalized AIDS-Related Stigma Scale,"Kalichman, S. C.; Simbayi, L. C.; Cloete, A.; Mthembu, P. P.; Mkhonta, R. N.; Ginindza, T.","AIDS stigmas create significant barriers to HIV prevention, testing, and care and can become internalized by people living with HIV/AIDS. We developed a psychometric scale to measure internalized AIDS-related stigmas among people infected with HIV. Items were adapted from a psychometrically sound test of AIDS-related stigmas in the general population. Six items reflecting self-defacing beliefs and negative perceptions of people living with HIV/AIDS were responded to dichotomously, Agree/Disagree. Data collected from people living with HIV/AIDS in Cape Town South Africa (n=1068), Swaziland (n=1090), and Atlanta US (n=239) showed that the internalized AIDS Stigma Scale was internally consistent (overall alpha coefficient=0.75) and time stable (r=0.53). We also found evidence in support of the scale's convergent, discriminant, and criterion-related validity. The Internalized AIDS-Related Stigma Scale appears reliable and valid and may be useful for research and evaluation with HIV-positive populations across southern African and North American cultures. \textcopyright 2009 Taylor \& Francis.",2009.0,10.1080/09540120802032627,QJPDGWP3,0,cognitive_additional,456

Method: Data from four different clinical trials were combined, yielding a total of 105 patients. After controlling for gender, age and initial symptomatic distress, the predictive validity of the PBI subscales was investigated using the symptom checklist-90-revised (SCL-90-R) and inventory of interpersonal problems-64 (IIP-64) at termination as dependent measures in each treatment condition using separate hierarchical multiple regression analyses. Results: Using the SCL-90-R at termination as dependent measure, reports of higher paternal and maternal care were related to a worse outcome in the Pesso-Boyden System Psychomotor condition, whereas reports of higher paternal care were related to a better outcome in the Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy condition. Also, higher maternal protection was related to a better outcome in the Cognitive-Behavioral Group condition. Using the IIP-64 at termination as dependent measure, reports of higher paternal protection were related to a better outcome in the Treatment As Usual condition. Discussion: The study shows that the PBI may function as a clinical predictor for treatment response, although the results were somewhat contrary to previous reportings. Future studies should contrast and investigate possible differences between individual and group treatments further, as well as more clearly defined diagnostic groups.

457,Adult children of alcoholic or mentally ill parents: alcohol consumption and psychological distress in a tri-ethnic community study.,"Neff, J. A.","Data from a racially and ethnically heterogeneous random community sample of 1,784 adults were used to compare effects of reported parental alcoholism, parental mental illness, both alcoholism and mental illness, or no parental pathology. No parental history differences were observed among males with regard to psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and somatization) or drinking patterns (drinking, quantity, frequency, or total weekly consumption). Among females, the parental-mental-illness-only group consistently reported more problems than did the no-pathology group on depression, anxiety, somatization, and drinking quantity, even after statistical controls for demographic factors, social desirability, and possible coping resources such as fatalism, religiosity, and self-esteem. While parental alcoholism appeared to have little impact upon psychological distress dimensions relative to the no pathology group, further analyses conducted separately for current drinkers vs. nondrinkers indicated consistently lower levels of depression, anxiety, and somatization among male nondrinkers than drinkers from families involving parental alcoholism. The specificity of these effects to males reporting parental alcoholism may reflect either the resilience of male Adult Children of Alcoholics (ACOAs) who do not drink and/or the role of drinking as a mediator of parental alcoholism. Possible reasons for the general lack of parental alcoholism and racial/ethnic differences are discussed.",1994.0,,WGE9VBKY,0,cognitive_additional,458
458,Predictors of patient satisfaction after ultrabrief bifrontal and unilateral electroconvulsive therapies for major depression,"Sienaert, P. A.; Vansteelandt, K.; Demyttenaere, K.; Peuskens, J.","A simple and sensitive radiometric method to determine the individual enantiomers of cicloprofen has been developed. 14C-Cicloprofen was converted to its L-leucine diastereoisomers, which were separated by thin-layer chromatography and quantified by measuring the radioactivity in the area corresponding to each individual diastereoisomer. This technique has also been used to measure the enantiomers of unlabeled cicloprofen by condensing with 14C-labeled L-leucine. By using the radiometric method, a unique biotransformation process, the inversion of the (-)-enantiomer of alpha-methylfluorene-2-acetic acid to its (+)-enantiomer, has been demonstrated in the rat and monkey. The rate of (-)- to (+)-inversion was found to be faster in the rat than in the monkey. After single or repeated oral adminstration of the racemic modification or the (-)-enantiomer of cicloprofen to both species, the ratio of (+)- to (-)-enantiomers of cicloprofen in plasma, urine, or bile increased with time. At 5, 22, and 48 hr after oral administration of a single 50-mg/kg dose of the (-)-enantiomer, 14C-cicloprofen in rat plasma contained 20, 50, and 79%, respectively, of the (+)-enantiomer. After receiving the same dose of (-)-enantiomer, monkey plasma contained 16.5% and 32% of (+)-enantiomer at 8 and 24 hr, respectively. After oral administration of a single 50-mg/kg dose of the (+)-enantiomer of 14C-cicloprofen to rats and monkeys, the percentage of (-)-enantiomer in plasma varied from 2 to 15%. Since the administered (+)-enantiomer contained 4% of (-)-enantiomer and the (+)-enantiomer was excreted at a faster rate than its (-)-antipode by rats or monkeys, it is not known whether an occasional small percentage increase of (-)-enantiomer in plasma resulted from the (+)-to-(-) inversion, or from faster elimination of the (+)-enantiomer. Nevertheless, if (+)-to-(-) inversion does occur in these two species, the rate is much slower than for the (-)-to-(+) inversion.",2010.0,10.1097/YCT.0b013e3181ac3c8e,YLUSNKET,0,behavior,459

Patients enrolled in group therapy for social phobia completed pre- and post-treatment questionnaire measures of perceived criticism and anxious and depressive symptoms. Designated significant others were assessed for the components of high EE (criticism, hostility and emotional overinvolvement) using the Camberwell Family Interview. It was hypothesized that these high-EE components and patients' perceived criticism would be associated with poorer treatment outcome, and results ran counter to these expectations. Controlling for initial social phobia severity, lower levels of perceived criticism predicted treatment dropout. There was also a nonsignificant trend for participants with a significant other rated as high in emotional overinvolvement to show less change on a composite symptom measure.

460,Mechanisms of developing post-traumatic stress disorder: new targets for drug development and other potential interventions.,"Wimalawansa, Sunil J.","The post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is defined as a severe anxiety disorder that develops after exposure to an event with actual, threatened, or perceived death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of oneself or others that results in significant psychological trauma. Moreover, the ability of people to handle acute severe stress experiences varies among individuals. Depending on the underlying personality and resiliency, therefore, PTSD can occur in individuals exposed to exceedingly stressful incidences or those who have encountered seemingly less overwhelming stressors. In addition to severe stressful exposure, multiple other factors including genetic susceptibility; past experiences; cultural, spiritual, and personal beliefs; bullying and harassments; and lack of support at the workplace, social, and home environement may contribute to the development of PTSD. Author investigated multiple potential mechanisms for the development and sustenance of PTSD based on the recent literature and his own experiences and insight. Based on this search, author indicates that among other pathological and biochemical abnormalities, hormonal aberrations are most likely key mechanisms initiating and the maintenance of the PTSD. These pathophysiological neuro-hormonal changes instigate maladaptive learning processes caused by sustained high levels of anxiety and fear, through a hypo-responsive hypothalamic-pituitary axis and hyper-responsive catecholamine system (persistently elevated blood norepinephrine levels and lower than appropriate glucocorticoid levels). In addition to having inappropriately low serum cortisol levels and high epinephrine and norepinephrine levels, patients with PTSD also have mitochondrial dysfunctions and other hormonal abnormalities. Based on these data, author concluded that these pathological, biochemical and sustained neurohormonal abnormalities are likely to influence the structural brain changes, particularly in the amygdala and hippocampus, which are characteristics of patients with PTSD. Considering these abnormalities, neuroendocrine system needs to be considered as a key target for new drug development for prevention and treatment of PTSD.",2014.0,,ZFZY5I3Z,0,personality,461

High interpersonal sensitivity has been associated with the development and maintenance of mental health problems. This study aimed to examine whether the Italian version of the interpersonal sensitivity measure (IPSM) has good internal consistence and convergent validity. METHODS: Validity was established on a sample of 153 Italian adolescents and young adult help seekers for several psychological problems. These subjects were divided in two groups - depressive spectrum disorder group (n=42) and other diagnosis group (n=111) - according to Structured Clinical Interview (SCID-I) for DSM-IV and Kiddie-Sads-Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL). For convergent validity, we studied the correlation between total and each subscale IPSM scores and the General Symptoms (included depressive and dysphoric symptoms) of Prodromal Questionnaire. RESULTS: The internal consistency were adequate and comparable to the original Boyce and Parker study. The validity was good, as indicated by both the convergent validity analysis and the depressive spectrum disorder group and other diagnosis group comparison. LIMITATIONS: The absence of another scale measuring interpersonal sensitivity to assess the construct validity of IPSM; the clinical heterogeneity of the sample; the absence of test re-test reliability of the instrument. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the results of internal consistency and convergent validity of the IPSM indicates that this version translated into Italian is valid and reliable.",2014.0,10.1016/j.jad.2013.12.012,DEPG8QNB,0,personality,462
462,The influence of maternal psychosocial characteristics on infant feeding styles,"Barrett, K. J.; Thompson, A. L.; Bentley, M. E.","Maternal feeding styles in infancy and early childhood are associated with children's later risk for overweight and obesity. Maternal psychosocial factors that influence feeding styles during the complementary feeding period, the time during which infants transition from a milk-based diet to one that includes solid foods and other non-milk products, have received less attention. The present study explores how maternal psychosocial factors-specifically self-esteem, parenting self-efficacy, parenting satisfaction, and depression symptoms-influence mothers' infant feeding styles at nine months of age, a time during which solid foods eating habits are being established. Participants included 160 low-income, African-American mother-infant pairs in central North Carolina who were enrolled in the Infant Care and Risk of Obesity Study. Regression models tested for associations between maternal psychosocial characteristics and pressuring and restrictive feeding styles. Models were first adjusted for maternal age, education, marital status and obesity status. To account for infant characteristics, models were then adjusted for infant weight-for-length, distress to limitations and activity level scores. Maternal self-esteem was negatively associated with pressuring to soothe. Maternal parenting self-efficacy was positively associated with restriction-diet quality. Maternal parenting satisfaction and depression symptoms were not associated with feeding styles in the final models. Focusing on strengthening maternal self-esteem and parenting self-efficacy may help to prevent the development of less desirable infant feeding styles.",2016.0,,JAC8982Y,0,behavior,463

L.; Hyman, K. B.; Baum, A.","Background: Alterations of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function and sympathetic-adrenal activity have been proposed as key factors in biological models of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods: We examined neuroendocrine function in female survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) with lifetime (current or remitted) PTSD (n=29) and in women who were exposed to IPV but never developed PTSD (n=20). Salivary cortisol was collected as a marker of HPA axis function at 1, 4, 9, and 11 h after awakening. Platelet epinephrine and norepinephrine were assayed as markers of sympathetic-adrenal activation. Results: Women with lifetime PTSD had significantly higher cortisol levels across the day compared to abuse-exposed participants without PTSD, after controlling for age, depression, severity, and latency of abuse. There were no significant group differences in levels of platelet catecholamines. Conclusions: Elevated cortisol levels may be a biomarker of IPV-related lifetime PTSD, reflecting long-lasting changes associated with trauma-exposure or possibly a reflection of risk for PTSD in women. \textcopyright 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

464,The Relationship between Intolerance of Uncertainty and Anxiety in Men on Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer,"Tan, H. J.; Marks, L. S.; Hoyt, M. A.; Kwan, L.; Filson, C. P.; Macairan, M.; Lieu, P.; Litwin, M. S.; Stanton, A. L.","Purpose Anxiety may serve as a major barrier to participation in active surveillance. Intolerance of uncertainty, that is the tendency to perceive the potential for negative events as threatening, has been linked to cancer related worry. Accordingly we explored prospectively the relationship of intolerance of uncertainty with anxiety along with other clinical factors among men treated with active surveillance for prostate cancer. Materials and Methods A total of 119 men with D'Amico low risk prostate cancer participating in active surveillance completed the HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), MAX-PC (Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer), IUS (Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale) and I-PSS (International Prostate Symptom Score) surveys from 2011 to 2014. We evaluated the relationship between anxiety and IUS score after adjusting for patient characteristics, cancer information and I-PSS using bivariable and multivariable analyses. Results Of the men 18 (15.1 \% ) and 17 (14.3 \% ) reported clinically significant anxiety on the generalized and prostate cancer specific scales, respectively. On bivariable analysis men with moderate/severe urinary symptoms and higher IUS scores reported more generalized and prostate cancer specific anxiety than men with mild urinary symptoms and lower IUS scores, respectively (p ≤0.008). Men with depressive symptoms (p = 0.024) or a family history of prostate cancer (p = 0.006) experienced greater generalized anxiety. On multivariable analysis IUS score was significantly associated with generalized and prostate cancer specific anxiety (OR 1.22, 95 \% CI 1.09-1.38 and OR 1.29, 95 \% CI 1.13-1.49, respectively) while moderate/severe urinary symptoms were associated with prostate cancer specific anxiety (OR 6.89, 95 \% CI 1.33-35.68). Conclusions Intolerance of uncertainty and urinary symptoms may promote anxiety in men on active surveillance for prostate cancer. Patient education, management of lower urinary tract symptoms and behavioral interventions may lessen anxiety related to uncertainty intolerance and help maintain patient engagement in active surveillance.",2016.0,10.1016/j.juro.2016.01.108,TUFAUL3Z,0,cognitive_additional,465
465,Psychopathological and functional correlates of behavioral activation and avoidance in schizophrenia,"Depp, C. A.; Cardenas, V.; Harris, S.; Vahia, I. V.; Patterson, T. L.; Mausbach, B. T.","Behavioral activation and avoidance are well studied in depression, yet the relationship of these constructs to symptoms, cognitive ability and functioning in schizophrenia is poorly understood. In a sample of 73 middle-aged and older outpatients with schizophrenia (mean [SD] age, 50.3 [6.3] years), we examined the relationship of the Activation and Avoidance subscales of the Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale with measures of psychopathology (positive and negative symptoms, depression), global cognitive ability, and functioning (observer-rated, performance-based, and subjective functioning). Neither activation nor avoidance related to sociodemographic variables, age of onset, or antipsychotic dose. Although activation and avoidance were significantly intercorrelated, only behavioral activation was significantly associated with depression and subjective functioning, whereas only avoidance related to negative symptoms. Avoidance accounted for significant variation in observer-rated functioning after adjusting for cognitive ability. These results suggest that activation and avoidance may be important therapeutic targets in schizophrenia, with somewhat divergent pathways among psychopathological features to functional impairment. \textcopyright 2011 by Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.",2011.0,,DWSESANH,0,behavior,466

K.; Namkoong, K.; Ji, Kang; Hc, Chung; Hc, Jeung; Sj, Kim; Sk, An; K, Namkoong","Cancer patients, who have to adapt to a long treatment process with multiple stressful events, show various stress responses. Genetic components may contribute to individual differences in stress response and risk for development of stress-related psychiatric problems. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) gene polymorphisms regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis on individual distress levels in cancer patients faced with similar stressful situation. The present study used a prospective design to elucidate predictors of distress. A total of 130 patients (90 males, 40 females) who were newly diagnosed with advanced gastric cancer and supposed to receive first-line chemotherapy were initially assessed, and a six-week follow-up assessment occurred for 93 patients (63 males, 30 females) after two cycles of chemotherapy. Distress levels and coping patterns were measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer (Mini-MAC) scale. For genetic factors, three single nucleotide polymorphisms of FKBP5 rs1360780, rs9296158 and rs9470080 were genotyped. For HADS-anxiety, FKBP5 rs9296158 had a significant group-by-time interaction (p= 0.015), and rs9470080 and rs1360780 had a marginally significant interaction (p= 0.023, p= 0.038, respectively). For HADS-depression, rs9470080 and rs9296158 had a marginally significant group-by-time interaction (p= 0.026, p= 0.032, respectively). In addition, a step-wise linear regression analysis showed that FKBP5 rs9470080 and rs9296158 were significant predictors of anxiety and depression after prolonged stress exposure in cancer patients. Our findings indicate that the genetic factors regulating the HPA axis such as FKBP5 gene polymorphisms may play a crucial role in anxiety and depression following prolonged stress exposure. \textcopyright 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2012.0,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2012.02.017,7Q527M6X,0,diathesis,467
467,Social support and depression among community dwelling older adults.,"Tinsley, Scharles Cercy Petty","Although social support variables have long been associated with psychological well-being, and in particular, depressive symptoms, few studies have examined the causal association between social support and depressive symptoms. The present study examined two basic hypotheses: do levels of social support predict later depressive symptoms, or conversely, do depressive symptoms predict subsequent declines in social support? Depression is the most frequent cause of emotional suffering in older adults, and thus identifying contributors to depressive symptoms among older adults has important implications for developing treatment for depressive symptoms. Two hypotheses regarding the causal relation between the association between social support and depression were identified. Lewinsohn's social skills model of depression posits that social skills deficits lead to reduced social support, which in turn produces depression. In contrast, Coyne's interpersonal theory of depression (1976), proposed that depressed individuals interact with others in a manner that is aversive and lacking in social skills (Coyne, 1976), which serves to reduce social support. In the current study, the influence of three dimensions of social support on subsequent depressive symptoms was examined. In a modified test of the first hypothesis (low social support predicts depression), the present study examined the influence of the three dimensions of social support (i.e., emotional social support, instrumental support and size of social network), on subsequent depressive symptoms in a sample of older adults. The second hypothesis examined whether depressive symptoms negatively impacted subsequent levels of social support, that is, whether initial levels of baseline (time 1) depressive symptoms had a negative impact on indices of social support. It should be noted these were only partial test of Coyne and Lewinsohns's theories, as social skills was not measure in the current study. A longitudinal study design based on data obtained from the Duke EPESE was employed to examine the association between dimensions of social support and depressive symptoms over a six-year period in a sample of older adults (N=2100). The three dimensions of social support were identified based on a factor analysis of survey items included in the EPESE study. These social support measures tapped aspects of both the quality and quantity of social support. Depressive symptoms were measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). A test of the first hypothesis, that social support deficits would predict subsequent depressive symptoms among older adults was not supported. Inconsistent with Lewinsohn's theory, as quality of instrumental support increased, depression increased. Therefore, it appears that individuals with more difficulty are receiving more instrumental support from family and friends. In a test of the second hypothesis, based on Coyne's theory of depression, baseline (time 1) depressive symptoms were examined to see if they predicted any of the social support measures. Depressive symptoms measured at time 1 did not predict any of the social support measures assessed at time 2. However, there was a sex and depression interaction in the prediction of size of social networks. As depression decreased the size of social networks increased, but it increased more for men than women. Maintaining a large network of support may be more important to men than for women. However, in partial support of a Coyne's modified theory results showed that a change in depressive symptoms did predict a change in emotional social support such that as depression decreased emotional support increased. Similarly, a change in depressive symptoms predicted a change in social network support such that as depression decreased social network support increased.

470,Brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neuroplasticity in bipolar disorder.,"Kapczinski, Flavio; Frey, Benicio N.; Kauer-Sant'Anna, Marcia; Grassi-Oliveira, Rodrigo","Initial descriptions of bipolar disorder (BD) emphasized that patients returned to a baseline condition after acute episodes. Such definitions were operational in teasing bipolar disorder apart from schizophrenia, where patients were described to be permanently impaired after the initial episodes. However, this view of BD as a disorder where cognition and overall functioning was spared has been changing after the scrutiny of new research. Currently, the cognitive impairment and neuroanatomical changes related to cumulative mood episodes, particularly manic episodes, are well described. In terms of neuropathological findings, recent data suggest that changes in neuronal plasticity, particularly in cell resilience and connectivity, are the main findings in BD. Data from differential lines of research converge to BDNF as an important contributor to the pathophysiology of BD. Serum BDNF levels have been shown to be decreased in depressive and manic episodes, returning to normal levels in euthymia. Moreover, factors that negatively influence the course of BD, such as life stress and trauma, have been shown to be associated with a decrease in serum BDNF levels among bipolar patients. These findings suggest that BDNF plays a central role in the transduction of psychosocial stress and recurrent episodes into the neurobiology of bipolar disorder. The present review discusses the role of BDNF as a mediator of the neuroplastic changes that occur in portion with mood episodes and the potential use of serum BDNF as a biomarker in BD.",2008.0,10.1586/14737175.8.7.1101,Q2INADDY,0,cognitive,471

Empirical support for the factor structure of the MADRS is mixed; further, the comparison of MADRS scores within and between patients requires the demonstration of consistent instrument properties. The objective of the current investigation was to evaluate MADRS factor structure as well as MADRS factorial invariance across time and gender. The MADRS was administered to 821 depressed outpatients participating in a large-scale effectiveness study of combined pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for depression. Treatment outcome did not differ across treatment groups. Factor structure and invariance was evaluated via confirmatory factor analysis. A four-factor model consisting of Sadness, Negative Thoughts, Detachment and Neurovegetative symptoms demonstrated a good fit to the data. This four-factor structure was invariant across time and gender. A hierarchical model, in which these four factors served as indicators of a general depression factor, was also supported. A limitation of the current study is the lack of comprehensive characterization of patient clinical features; results need to be replicated in more severely depressed or treatment refractory patients. Overall, evidence supported the use of the MADRS total score as well as subscales focused on affective, cognitive, social and somatic aspects of depression in male and female outpatients.",2013.0,10.1002/mpr.1388,MZS5GFPQ,0,personality,472

K.","INTRODUCTION: In Denmark, following psychiatric emer gency admission, patients with depression, anxiety or per sonality disorders are discharged as early as possible due to pressure on psychiatric beds. However, the receiving out patient units frequently have waiting time. The design of a brief, cognitivebased psychiatric aftercare service and the early treatment results are presented. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a descriptive study of symptom levels before and after the individual therapy part of a new aftercare programme. The initial new intensive aftercare consisted of psychiatric consultations, telephone outreach and individual cognitive behavioural therapy based therapy twice a week, in total five times. Focus was on collaborative goal setting and nextofkin participation. Selfratings (WHO5 WellBeing Scale (WHO5); Becks De pression InventoryII (BDI)) were obtained at the first day and at end of individual therapy. RESULTS: The selfratings at discharge showed a high BDI rating in the patient sample (mean = 32.0 (standard devi ation (SD): 11.9, n = 105)), and much lower wellbeing at discharge than previously seen in a comparable Danish set ting (mean WHO5 at onset = 5.6 (SD: 4.8, n = 102)). Ratings improved by the end of the individual therapy (i.e. WHO5 = 8.3 (SD: 5.6; n = 102); BDI = 26.1 (SD: 12.3; n = 105)). CONCLUSION: Symptom reduction was evident in the first period after discharge, and the patients were satisfied with the contents and format of the service. However, the re sults are preliminary as we lack data from a comparable pa tient group receiving no treatment or treatment as usual. FUNDING: not relevant.

473,An overview of child physical abuse: developing an integrated parent-child cognitive-behavioral treatment approach.,"Runyon, Melissa K.; Deblinger, Esther; Ryan, Erika E.; Thakkar-Kolar, Reena","This article reviews and summarizes the extant literature regarding child physical abuse (CPA). Literature is summarized that describes the wide range of short- and long-term effects of CPA on children as well as the documented characteristics of parents/caregivers who engage in physically abusive parenting practices. Although the reviewed research documents that interventions geared only toward the parent have been found to produce significant improvements with respect to parenting abilities, parent-child interactions, and children's behavior problems, there is a paucity of research examining the efficacy of interventions developed specifically to target the child's emotional and behavioral difficulties. Based on the few studies that have shown emotional and behavioral gains for children who have participated in treatment, an integrated parent-child cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) approach is proposed here to address the complex issues presented by both parent and child in CPA cases. The direct participation of the child in treatment also may improve our ability to target posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depressive symptoms as well as anger control and dysfunctional abuse attributions in the children themselves. Implications for practice, public policy, and research are also addressed.",2004.0,10.1177/1524838003259323,X434T5BB,0,cognitive,474

The aim of this study was to examine these traits in twins with eating disorders. Methods: The Reading the Mind in the Eyes test, Emotional Stroop task and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale were administered to 112 twins with and without eating disorders (DSM IV-TR eating disorder criteria). Generalised estimating equations compared twins with eating disorders against unaffected co-twins and control twins, and within-pair correlations were calculated for clinical monozygotic (n = 50) and dizygotic twins (n = 20). Results: Emotion recognition difficulties, attentional biases to social threat and difficulties in emotion regulation were greater in twins with eating disorders, and some were present in their unaffected twin siblings. Evidence for a possible genetic basis was highest for emotion recognition and attentional biases to social stimuli. Conclusion: Emotion recognition difficulties and sensitivity to social threat appear to be endophenotypes associated with eating disorders. However, the limited statistical power means that these findings are tentative and require further replication. \textcopyright 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd and Eating Disorders Association.",2013.0,10.1002/erv.2232,FN6C9NJ8,0,cognitive_additional,475

We investigated whether HIV-infected persons with ANI were more likely than those who were neurocognitively normal (NCN) to experience a decline in everyday functioning (symptomatic decline). Methods: A total of 347 human participants from the CNS HIV Anti-Retroviral Therapy Effects Research (CHARTER) cohort were NCN (n = 226) or had ANI (n = 121) at baseline. Neurocognitive assessments occurred approximately every 6 months, with median (interquartile range) follow-up of 45.2 (28.7-63.7) months. Symptomatic decline was based on self-report (SR) or objective, performance-based (PB) problems in everyday functioning. Proportional hazards modeling was used to generate risk ratios for progression to symptomatic HAND after adjusting for baseline and time-dependent covariates, including CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (CD4), virologic suppression, CART, and mood. Results: The ANI group had a shorter time to symptomatic HAND than the NCN after adjusting for baseline predictors: adjusted risk ratios for symptomatic HAND were 2.0 (confidence interval [CI] 1.1-3.6; p = 0.02) for SR, 5.8 (CI 3.2-10.7; p \textless 0.0001) for PB, and 3.2 (CI 2.0-5.0; p \textless 0.0001) for either SR or PB. Current CD4 and depression were significant time-dependent covariates, but antiretroviral regimen, virologic suppression, and substance abuse or dependence were not. Conclusions: This longitudinal study demonstrates that ANI conveys a 2-fold to 6-fold increase in risk for earlier development of symptomatic HAND, supporting the prognostic value of the ANI diagnosis in clinical settings. Identifying those at highest risk for symptomatic decline may offer an opportunity to modify treatment to delay progression.

H.; Mucenic, M.; de Mattos Meine, M. H.; Mariante-Neto, G.; Brandao, A. B. M.","Alcohol consumption accounts for 3.8% of annual global mortality worldwide, and the majority of these deaths are due to alcoholic liver disease (ALD), mainly alcoholic cirrhosis. ALD is one of the most common indications for liver transplantation (LT). However, it remains a complicated topic on both medical and ethical grounds, as it is seen by many as a ""self-inflicted disease"". One of the strongest ethical arguments against LT for ALD is the probability of relapse. However, ALD remains a common indication for LT worldwide. For a patient to be placed on an LT waiting list, 6 mo of abstinence must have been achieved for most LT centers. However, this ""6-mo rule"" is an arbitrary threshold and has never been shown to affect survival, sobriety, or other outcomes. Recent studies have shown similar survival rates among individuals who undergo LT for ALD and those who undergo LT for other chronic causes of end-stage liver disease. There are specific factors that should be addressed when evaluating LT patients with ALD because these patients commonly have a high prevalence of multisystem alcohol-related changes. Risk factors for relapse include the presence of anxiety or depressive disorders, short pre-LT duration of sobriety, and lack of social support. Identification of risk factors and strengthening of the social support system may decrease relapse among these patients. Family counseling for LT candidates is highly encouraged to prevent alcohol consumption relapse. Relapse has been associated with unique histopathological changes, graft damage, graft loss, and even decreased survival in some studies. Research has demonstrated the importance of a multidisciplinary evaluation of LT candidates. Complete abstinence should be attempted to overcome addiction issues and to allow spontaneous liver recovery. Abstinence is the cornerstone of ALD therapy. Psychotherapies, including 12-step facilitation therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and motivational enhancement therapy, help support abstinence. Nutritional therapy helps to reverse muscle wasting, weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, and trace element deficiencies associated with ALD. For muscular recovery, supervised physical activity has been shown to lead to a gain in muscle mass and improvement of functional activity. Early LT for acute alcoholic hepatitis has been the subject of recent clinical studies, with encouraging results in highly selected patients. The survival rates after LT for ALD are comparable to those of patients who underwent LT for other indications. Patients that undergo LT for ALD and survive over 5 years have a higher risk of cardiorespiratory disease, cerebrovascular events, and de novo malignancy.",2018.0,10.3748/wjg.v24.i26.2785,8Z3FM5WD,0,additional,477

The authors summarize the existing choices of treatment for depression, the value of combined treatments, and the assets that psychodynamic psychotherapy brings to bear on treating depression. The authors point out that in spite of the fact that there are no placebo-controlled studies demonstrating superiority of the psychodynamic approach, there is good reason to believe that its principles are important and that for selected patients it has great utility. The book begins with a review of the different ideas underlying a dynamic explanation of depression and a statement of fundamental principles behind psychodynamic treatment. The last introductory chapter presents a demystified overview of psychodynamic treatment that is exemplary in its clarity and freedom from jargon. The book includes a few special topics, including approaches to suicidal behavior and a chapter on the use of psychodynamic psychotherapy with other treatment approaches.

We examined whether or not personal norm and goal enjoyment contribute to predicting having condoms available in the context of cognition specified by the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). DESIGN: Prospective survey study, with a baseline and follow-up measurement (at 3 months). METHODS: Data were gathered using an online survey. In total 282 adolescents (mean age = 15.6, 74 \% female adolescents) completed both questionnaires. At baseline, demographics, sexual experience, condom use, TPB variables, descriptive norm, personal norm, and enjoyment towards having condoms available were measured. At T2 (3 months later) having condoms available was measured. Direct and moderating effects of personal norm and goal enjoyment were examined by means of hierarchical linear regression analyses. RESULTS: Regression analyses yielded a direct effect of self-efficacy and personal norm on condom availability. In addition, moderation of the intention-behaviour relation by goal enjoyment added to the variance explained. The final model explained approximately 35 \% of the variance in condom availability. CONCLUSIONS: Personal norm and goal enjoyment add to the predictive utility of a TPB model of having condoms available and may be useful intervention targets. STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION: What is already known about this subject? Having condoms available is an important prerequisite for actual condom use. The theory of planned behaviour has successfully been applied to explain condom availability behaviour. The theory of planned behaviour has been criticized for not adequately taking into account affective motivation. What does this study add? Personal norm and goal enjoyment add to the predictive utility of the model. Personal norm explains condom availability directly, enjoyment increases intention enactment. Personal norm and goal enjoyment therefore are useful intervention targets.",2013.0,10.1111/j.2044-8287.2012.02088.x,VQ7DS4BR,0,behavior,479

The treatment consisted of regularly spread out sessions, where a mixture of psychodynamic and behavioural interventions was necessary to contain and support the parental couple's struggle to become parents for the first time. The work emphasizes the need for containment of both the parents and the child, as the psychological damage the boy had suffered seemed--at least partially--to have stemmed from maternal depression and emotional unavailability during his early life, despite the family closeness. This work could be seen as a prolonged assessment and a platform for further treatment, which did eventually become possible for the child.

Specifically, this model argues that women compared to men are more at risk for self-esteem instability and depressive symptoms because they are more likely than men to base their self-worth on the qualify of their interpersonal relationships. Basing self-esteem on the qualify of one's relationships leads to instability in self-esteem as a result of successes and failures in one's relationships. This instability in self-esteem, in turn, predicts greater depressive symptoms. The model also proposes that rumination, negative feedback seeking, and excessive reassurance seeking may mediate the relation between having self-esteem contingent on interpersonal relationships and depressive symptoms. The current chapter provides an overview of this theory and presents preliminary research that suggests that indeed basing one's self-esteem on interpersonal relationships (e.g., romantic relationships, friendships) represents a risk factor for depression in women but not men. Methodological and theoretical explanations for findings will be examined in the context of the proposed model and competing models of gender differences in depression. For example, the same word (e.g. friendship) may have different meanings for men and women, and these meanings may contribute to inconsistent findings. After presenting the preliminary research on this model, suggestions are provided concerning future research directions.

484,The effects of acute tryptophan depletion and serotonin transporter polymorphism on emotional processing in memory and attention,"Roiser, J. P.; Mller, U.; Clark, L.; Sahakian, B. J.","Polymorphism at the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) has been associated with neuroticism, increased risk for affective disorders and greater vulnerability to mood change following serotonin (5-HT) depletion. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the cognitive effects of 5-HT depletion were differentially affected by genotype at the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism, using neuropsychological measures of memory and attention. We utilized the acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) technique to temporarily reduce 5-HT synthesis in two groups of healthy volunteers pre-selected on the basis of 5-HTTLPR genotype, 15 of the ll genotype and 15 of the ss genotype, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. As expected, ATD resulted in a robust reduction in plasma tryptophan concentration in both genotype groups. However, the genotype groups differed in terms of the effect of ATD on cognitive performance. The ss genotype group showed impaired verbal recall following depletion, while episodic memory was unimpaired by ATD in the ll genotype group. Averaging across depletion condition, the ss genotype group outperformed the ll genotype group on tests of episodic memory and attention. Neither group was significantly affected by ATD on measures of emotional state. These data confirm previous reports that ss individuals are particularly vulnerable to 5-HT depletion, but extend these findings to the cognitive domain. The unexpected finding that ss volunteers showed improved memory and attention relative to ll volunteers suggests a possible evolutionary advantage to possession of the s allele, which may offset the disadvantage of vulnerability to depression following stressful life events.

METHOD: Microsatellite DNA markers were studied in 656 families with two or more such cases (onset before age 31 in probands and age 41 in other relatives), including 1,494 informative all possible affected relative pairs (there were 894 independent affected sibling pairs). Analyses included a primary multipoint allele-sharing analysis (with ALLEGRO) and a secondary logistic regression analysis taking the sex of each relative pair into account (male-male, male-female, female-female). RESULTS: Genomewide suggestive evidence for linkage was observed on chromosome 15q25-q26 (at 105.4 centimorgans [cM]). The authors previously reported genomewide significant linkage in this region in the first 297 families. In the secondary analysis, after empirical genomewide correction for multiple testing, suggestive linkage results were observed on chromosome 17p12 (28.0 cM, excess sharing in male-male and male-female pairs) and on chromosome 8p22-p21.3 (25.1 cM, excess sharing in male-male pairs). CONCLUSIONS: These regions of chromosomes 15q, 17p, and 8p might contain genes that contribute to susceptibility to major depression and related disorders. Evidence for linkage has been reported independently in the same regions of chromosome 15q for major depression and of chromosome 8p for related personality traits.",2007.0,10.1176/ajp.2007.164.2.248,JKWAAAN6,0,personality,486
486,Examining the therapeutic relationship and confronting resistances in psychodynamic psychotherapy: A certified public accountant case,"Manetta, C. T.; Gentile, J. P.; Gillig, P. M.","Psychodynamic psychotherapy is effective for a variety of mental health symptoms. This form of psychotherapy uses patient self reflection and self examination, as well as the therapeutic relationship between the patient and psychiatrist, to explore maladaptive coping strategies and relationship patterns of the patient. A thorough understanding of resistance and the core conflictual relationship theme afford the psychiatrist the ability to facilitate this work. In this article, the composite case illustrates some of the psychodynamic psychotherapy techniques that can be employed in a psychotherapy case. In this example, the case is about a certified public accountant that came to treatment because of an acute stressor that put her career goals at risk. An acute episode or event can bring to light chronic and ongoing symptoms, which have had a remitting and relapsing course, and leave the patient unable to compensate on his or her own.",2011.0,,UYV3LGHZ,0,cognitive_additional,487

Several predictors of major depressive disorder have been established, but their predictive power is limited.

Over the following 2 years, 24 \ \% \ of participants developed a major depressive episode (MDE); illness onset was predicted by blunted FN at initial evaluation. Lower FN amplitude predicted more depressive symptoms during the follow-up period, even after controlling for neuroticism and depressive symptoms at baseline. This is the first prospective study to demonstrate a link between a neural measure of reward sensitivity and the first onset of an MDE. The current results suggest that low reward sensitivity may be an important factor in the development of depression.",2013.0,10.1111/j.1469-8986.2012.01485.x,8B4PX7L4,0,personality,488

Primary objective has been the implementation of individually tailored psychosocial support during routine medical care. This review shows that based on validly structured clinical interviews, 30-40 \% of the studied patient population had a mental disorder in accordance with the updated Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). Most common diagnoses were depression, adjustment and anxiety disorders. Risk factors included among others younger age, previous history of mental disorders and lack of social support. Screening instruments are useful, easy to complete and allow early detection of high distress in patients, enabling appropriate interventions in affected patients. Established methods in psycho-oncology are cognitive behavioural therapy, psycho-educational groups and relaxation trainings.

489,Correlates of psychological well-being and return to work decisions after the onset of end-stage renal disease.,"Randolph, Corlis Yvonne","This study explores psychosocial variables to understand why large numbers of African American blue collar males with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) leave employment and experience lower life quality. A review of the literature shows that medical, technological and pharmacological treatments enable return to a normal life style, including employment. Literature also shows comparable physical health for both employed and unemployed, but reveals that unemployment greatly lowers patients' quality of life. Return-to-work behavior of ESRD patients, when framed in the cognitive theory of stress and coping, is the result of appraisal processes. From that perspective, beliefs about the self and world as well as psychological, social and material resources influence adaptational outcomes. The ex post facto research design of this study used a multimethod triangulated approach with quantitative and qualitative methods. The quantitative hypothesis states: African American blue collar patients with higher levels of interpersonal trust, a more secure attachment style and stronger religious conviction are more likely to have higher levels of psychological well-being and to have returned to work after the onset of ESRD. Psychological well-being is defined as the absence of depression and anxiety. A telephone survey instrument used to collect quantitative data included measures of demographic and background variables along with each independent and dependent variable. A complementary qualitative research question asked: In what ways do attachment style and religious conviction influence psychological well-being and return-to-work after a diagnosis of ESRD. Semi-structured interviews permitted the systematic collection of audio taped qualitative data which was content analyzed and classified into narrative themes and patterns. Unexpected denial of ESRD population access reduced sample availability. Purposive sampling yielded 44 African American males aged 35 to 65; half had returned to work. From that group, a quota random sample of 20 voluntarily participated in the qualitative study. Bivariate and multivariate procedures revealed statistically significant relations between interpersonal trust, attachment style, religious conviction and return to work; attachment style, religious conviction and anxiety; and between attachment style and depression. Qualitative findings supported quantitative findings and provided more depth.

Membership in a high desister group predicted internalizing symptoms, rule-breaking behaviors, and borderline and narcissistic personality features. The findings suggest that although low levels of social and physical aggression may not bode poorly for adjustment, individuals engaging in high levels of social and physical aggression in middle childhood may be at greatest risk for adolescent psychopathology, whether they increase or desist in their aggression through early adolescence.",2011.0,10.1017/S095457941100023X,J6CYHTJQ,0,personality,491

A.; Pj, Molenaar; J, Dekker; R, Van; M, Hendriksen; A, Vink; Ra, Schoevers","The existence of an overall association between severity of depression and level of social functioning is well documented. To increase the probability of a long-term recovery, a normal level of social functioning is essential. It is currently unknown whether combined therapy has a better outcome than pharmacotherapy with regard to social functioning. In a 6-month randomized clinical trial in outpatients with major depression, all patients studied had a baseline score of at least 14 points on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). The two conditions consist of pharmacotherapy (PhT) (N = 84) and combined therapy (CoT), pharmacotherapy plus 16 sessions of short psychodynamic supportive psychotherapy (N = 83). Efficacy was assessed using the 17-item HDRS, the Clinical Global Impresnon (CGI) Severity and Improvement scales, the Depression subscale of the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), the Quality of Life Depression Scale (QLDS), more the Groningen Social Disability Schedule (GSDS). Severity of depression decreased significantly (on the SCL-90 Depression subscale and the QLDS) more in the CoT condition. A larger improvement in social functioning was demonstrated for remitted patients than for nonremitted patients. The number of dimensions of social functioning that had improved significantly was higher in CoT than in PhT. There was a moderate advantage of the CoT condition on both depressive symptoms and level of social functioning in comparison with PhT. We also found a positive association between depression severity and level of social functioning. 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",2007.0,10.1002/da.20254,4AAMWH6T,0,psychodynamic,492

Methods: The relative contributions of demographic, health, psychiatric, psychosocial, and cultural variables were assessed in a series of longitudinal and concurrent hierarchical multivariable analyses. Results: Results of the longitudinal analyses indicated that the risk for experiencing a first major depressive episode at 18-months follow-up was higher for those who initially rated their health as poor, reported higher depressive symptoms, and perceived higher levels of social support. After controlling for prior health and psychiatric and psychosocial status at time 1, the results of the concurrent analyses indicated that the risk for experiencing a first major depressive episode at time 2 was higher for those who rated their health as poor, had at least one other psychiatric disorder, were bilingual, experienced high levels of life stress, and perceived themselves as having low and/or decreased social supports. Conclusions: The results of this study confirm previous evidence that psychosocial vulnerabilities, including higher acculturation, greater stress exposure and reduced social supports, are important predictors of risk for first-onset depressive episodes.

M.; Hoff, R. A.","Background and aims: Gambling disorder and its comorbid diagnoses are observed at higher rates in military veterans than in the general population. A significant research gap exists regarding the relationships of veterans' life and service experiences to problematic gambling. The present study explored pre-, peri-, and post-deployment factors associated with problem gambling in veterans. Methods: Veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation New Dawn (n = 738; 463 males, and 275 females) completed questionnaires via structured telephone interview. We conducted bivariate and multinomial logistic regression analyses exploring associations among problem-gambling severity and socio-demographic variables, psychiatric comorbidities, and 10 scales of the Deployment Risk and Resilience Inventory measuring experiences pre-, peri-, and post-deployment. Results: Approximately 4.2 \% of veterans indicated at-risk or probable pathological gambling (ARPG) postdeployment (two or more DSM-IV criteria for pathological gambling). Bivariate analyses found more severe gambling in males, higher frequencies of post-traumatic stress disorder, substance dependence, traumatic brain injury, panic disorder, and depression in veterans with ARPG, and higher general harassment during deployment, and lower social support and more stressful life events post-deployment in those with ARPG. In multivariable models, both post-deployment factors remained significantly associated with ARPG. Discussion: The study suggests that problem gambling among veterans is related to service experiences, and particularly to life experiences post-deployment. Conclusions: Adverse service and life experiences and lack of social support may contribute to the risk of problem gambling in military veterans. Investigation of how Veterans Affairs clinical settings may serve veterans following deployment to prevent behavioral addictions is warranted.",2016.0,10.1556/2006.5.2016.027,TKQRDAA9,0,diathesis,494
494,Anger intensification with combat-related PTSD and depression comorbidity.,"Gonzalez, Oscar I.; Novaco, Raymond W.; Reger, Mark A.; Gahm, Gregory A.","Anger is becoming more widely recognized for its involvement in the psychological adjustment problems of current war veterans. Recent research with combat veterans has found anger to be related to psychological distress, psychosocial functioning, and harm risk variables. Using behavioral health data for 2,077 treatment-seeking soldiers who had been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, this study examined whether anger disposition was intensified for those who met screen-threshold criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Anger was assessed with a 7-item screening measure previously validated with the study population. The study tested the hypothesis that anger would be highest when PTSD \& MDD were conjoined, compared with PTSD only, MDD only, and no PTSD, no MDD. PTSD and depression were assessed with well-established screening instruments. A self-rated wanting to harm others variable was also incorporated. Age, gender, race, military component, military grade, and military unit social support served as covariates. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to test the hypothesis, which was confirmed. Anger was intensified in the PTSD \& MDD condition, in which it was significantly higher than in the other 3 conditions. Convergent support was obtained for wanting to harm others as an exploratory index. Given the high prevalence and co-occurrence of PTSD and MDD among veterans, the results have research and clinical practice relevance for systematic inclusion of anger assessment postdeployment from risk-assessment and screening standpoints.

C.; Schuengel, C.","BACKGROUND: Evidence supporting clinical relevance and persistence of disinhibited social engagement behavior (DSEB) pertains mostly to children reared in institutions and foster care. This study examined the course of DSEB in clinically referred home-reared children from early into middle childhood, and associations with neglect/emotional maltreatment, effortful control, Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, and Autism Spectrum Disorder. METHODS: Disinhibited social engagement behavior was examined in 124 children (82% boys, M = 4.06 years, SD = 0.89), referred for treatment of emotional and behavioral problems, by use of the Disturbances of Attachment Interview (DAI) with biological parents. Neglect and emotional maltreatment were assessed from case records and effortful control by use of the Child Behavior Questionnaire. At follow-up, on average 4 years later, DSEB was examined by use of DAI as well as two observational ratings: the Stranger at the Door procedure (SatD) and a structured home observation of stranger approach. Psychiatric disorders were assessed by means of the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia. RESULTS: Persistence of parent-reported DSEB was found in 57% (n = 27) of the children with DSEB at baseline (n = 47). Parent-reported DSEB at follow-up was significantly related to DSEB observed in the SatD (rpb = .31, p = .001) and to observed stranger approach (rs = .41, p < .001), but only stranger approach was associated with baseline DSEB. The course of DSEB was not related to neglect/emotional maltreatment, nor to the level of effortful control. There was no association between DSEB and Autism Spectrum Disorder, but course of DSEB was associated with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder/Oppositional Defiant Disorder at follow-up (chi(2) = 13.08, p = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Although explanations for the onset and course of DSEB in home-reared children remain elusive, findings suggest that DSEB is part of a complex of clinically significant problem behaviors in referred home-reared preschool children.",2018.0,10.1111/jcpp.12994,N6IRHES4,0,additional,497

498,"DSM-V, psychosis and the invention of risk as a new disorder","Jones, P. B.","The DSM-V revision has prompted a great deal of debate in the schizophrenia field where this prototypic category of psychotic illness has remained in place for a century, albeit with an interlude of psychoanalytic wandering in the mid 20th Century. Schizophrenia now has a cognitive element clearly linked to disability. This important step gives new therapeutic targets and improved understanding of clinical management approaches and its inclusion in DSM-V underscores its attempts to be scientific. Similarly, DSM-V has caused debates over whether some domains of psychopathology, such as affective symptoms, and anxiety phenomena (including OCD) should be included in the syndrome in dimensional terms. Purely categorical definitions may under-emphasise such aspects of the condition that lead to great disability and are eminently treatable, but that are over-shadowed by the schizophrenia definition. However, it is at the early stages of illness that most debate has been focused. Young adults often first present with a multitude of undifferentiated and dynamic psychopathology such that, in the earliest months, conventional categories are less helpful for either research or clinical practice, with schizophrenia or other diagnoses being seen as outcomes. This asks many conceptual questions about causes and mechanisms of these disorders, and also pushes interest back towards highly undifferentiated states that, on the one hand may lead to help-seeking and morbidity, and on the other to spontaneous remission and good outcome in the majority. Such At-Risk Mental States (ARMS) have sparked fierce debate over whether they should be included as diagnostic categories in DSM-V, or whether they are merely a part of a spectrum that encompasses normality at one end and schizophrenia at the other. Evidence to suggest that the vast majority of young people with ARMS will remit and should not be considered diseased is recently emerging. This may be too late for decisions in DSM-V and its aspiration to be based on evidence, and the costs to those wrongly classified may be considerable.",2011.0,,TFU5XY9L,0,psychodynamic,499

Identifying networks of modifiable risk and maintenance factors that contribute to both youth anxiety and depression (i.e., internalizing problems) may enhance and broaden treatment benefits by informing the development of mechanism-targeted interventions. A particularly powerful network is the rich array of family processes linked to internalizing problems (e.g., parenting styles, parental mental health problems, and sibling relationships). Here, we propose a new theoretical model, the triadic model of family process, to organize theory and evidence around modifiable, transdiagnostic family factors that may contribute to youth internalizing problems. We describe the model's implications for intervention, and we propose strategies for testing the model in future research. The model provides a framework for studying associations among family processes, their relation to youth internalizing problems, and family-based strategies for strengthening prevention and treatment.",2017.0,10.1017/s095457941600016x,7GIPWZB6,0,additional,500

Youth with comorbid conduct problems and depression have even greater functional impairment in many of these areas than do youth with symptomatology in one domain. This current study aims to increase our understanding of comorbid depression and CP in youth. To that end, both continuous and categorical measures of CP and depression were created using multiple-reporter constructs. Continuous measures of CP and depression were used to examine the longitudinal relationship between the two sets of symptoms in the development of comorbidity in the transition from childhood to early adolescence. Categorical measures were used to predict the stability of CP, depression, and their comorbid presentation over time. The differential relationships between a variety of adjustment outcomes (e.g., academic achievement, social competence, antisocial peer relations, suicidality, and substance use) and CP, depression and their comorbid presentation were examined using both continuous and categorical measures. In addition, gender and ethnicity differences were examined. This study used a gender-balanced, ethnically diverse sample of 435 children from high-risk neighborhoods in four sites around the country. Youth-, parent-, and teacher-report of symptomatology were collected in fifth grade. Multiple-reporter measures of adolescent adjustment, including academic achievement, social competence, and suicidality were collected in seventh grade. Youth-report of antisocial peer relations and substance use was also collected in seventh grade. Results indicate that CP predicts depression longitudinally, but depression does not predict CP. Comorbid symptomatology is the most stable over time, followed by CP. Depression is the least stable symptomatology over time. Continuous analyses indicate that depression and CP are both risk factors for multiple negative adjustment outcomes. Categorical analyses suggest that comorbid CP and depression is generally no worse than CP-alone and depression-alone is similar to no symptomatology in terms of level of adjustment problems. No gender differences were found in the relationship between symptomatology and adjustment. The utility of using continuous vs. categorical scoring methods in predicting adolescent adjustment is discussed.

Methods: The study used meta-synthesis. Published qualitative studies were identified using a structured search, and themes synthesized across studies to develop a new explanatory framework. Results: Searches of three databases identified 5506 papers, and 22 were included. Diagnosis of diabetes and the impact of symptoms on functioning were associated with varied psychological reactions, not all of which are negative, and the concept of 'depression' only captures aspects of the experience. Similarly, the relationship between diabetes and relationships with professionals and family were variable, with relationships serving as both a buffer of the effects of diabetes and potentially as a cause of further difficulties for patients. Depression and other psychological states were significant barriers to effective coping. Definition of 'self' emerged as a key potential moderator of the relationship between depression and diabetes. Conclusions: The variability in psychological reactions to diabetes suggested three key clinical implications, reflecting increasing levels of complexity for practitioners. \textcopyright The Author(s) 2011.",2011.0,10.1177/1742395311403636,42BRY6P3,0,cognitive_additional,502

Serious implications can result from psychological difficulties in COPD including reduced survival, lower quality of life, and reduced physical and social functioning, increased use of health care resources and are associated with unhealthy behaviours such as smoking. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a psychological intervention which is recommended for the treatment of many mental health problems including anxiety and depression. Unfortunately access to trained CBT therapists is limited. The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that CBT delivered by respiratory nurses is effective in the COPD population.

In this essay, I explain the connection between photography and loss, and how photography fits within Lacan's understanding of the Imaginary, the Symbolic, the Real, and the 'gaze'. I discuss complicated mourning (circumstances which inhibit/delay mourning) and the difficulties created by political disappearances: as long as the family members maintain the belief that their loved one(s) might still be alive, they cannot begin the process of mourning the permanently lost object. Beginning with the Madres de Plaza de Mayo and, using the web-based art exhibits of Marcelo Brodsky and In \' e s Ulanovsky, I analyze the role of the photograph in Argentina, how it serves as a linking object, how it is used to symbolize the dead/missing, and how it can function to facilitate mourning, or to serve as proof of pathological melancholia. I argue that such artistic representations of loss function to reinscribe healthy mourning rituals within the Argentine society. \textcopyright 2011 Institute of Psychoanalysis.",2011.0,,IJGVBIBN,0,psychodynamic,504

ANALYSIS: (1) prevalence estimated in 2-year age-bands and (2) persistence rates calculated at each subsequent time point for each condition among affected children. RESULTS: 10 090 children participated in Wave 1 and 6717 in all waves. From age 2, more than 60% of children were experiencing at least one health condition at any age. Distinct prevalence patterns by age-bands comprised eight conditions that steadily rose (overweight/obesity, obesity, injury, anxiety/depression, frequent headaches, abdominal pain, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder). Six conditions fell with age (eczema, sleep problems, day-wetting, soiling, constipation, recurrent tonsillitis), three remained stable (asthma, diabetes, epilepsy) and two peaked in mid-childhood (dental decay, recurrent ear infections). Conditions were more likely to persist if present for 2 years; persistence was especially high for obesity beyond 6-7 (91.3%-95.1% persisting at 14-15). CONCLUSIONS: Beyond infancy, most Australian children are experiencing at least one ongoing health condition at any given time. This study's age-specific estimates of prevalence and persistence should assist families and clinicians to plan care. Conditions showing little resolution (obesity, asthma, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) require long-term planning and management.",2018.0,10.1136/archdischild-2017-313191,GKQYP79F,0,additional,505
505,The Spanish Reasons for Living Inventory (SRFL-I): factor structure and association with suicide risk among Spanish speaking Hispanics.,"Garza, M. J.; Cramer, R. J.","The present study examined the factor structure of a Spanish-translated version of the Reasons for Living Inventory (SRFL-I; Oquendo, Baca-Garcia, Graver et al., 2000). Participants (N = 168) were from a combined sample of bilingual undergraduate students and monolingual Spanish speaking outpatients at a community health center. Factor analytic results yielded a seven factor structure: Survival Beliefs, Suicide Appraisal, Problem Solving Beliefs, Family Related Concerns, Suicide Self-Efficacy, Moral Objections, and Fear of Suicide. The SRFL-I subscales displayed high internal consistencies, as well as appropriate convergent and divergent associations with depression and suicide indicators. As expected, subscales (Problem Solving Beliefs, Moral Objections, Survival Beliefs, and Suicide Self-Efficacy) from the SRFL-I displayed direct and moderating effects on suicide risk indicators.

507,Exploring the heterogeneity in clinical presentation and functional impairment of postpartum depression,"Class, Q. A.; Verhulst, J.; Heiman, J. R.","Objective: Examine the spectrum of postpartum psychiatric conditions with the aim to evaluate the current use of a postpartum onset specifier. Background: The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR) uses an onset specifier to categorise a limited number of psychiatric diagnoses as postpartum onset. Diagnoses and clinical symptomatology, however, may be more complex than what the DSM-IV-TR allows. Methods: A total of 59 women aged 19-41 years were recruited 3-6 months postpartum. Women completed questionnaires and those scoring possibly depressed, identified by scoring at least 10 (30 maximum) on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, participated in semi-structured psychiatric evaluations. Degree of functional impairment was rated on a three-point scale. Results: Possibly depressed women did not differ from healthy controls on several background characteristics. Postpartum diagnoses were heterogeneous; only 46 \% of possibly depressed women received a diagnosis of major depression. Other diagnoses included depressive disorder not otherwise specified, adjustment disorder, anxiety disorder not otherwise specified, alcohol dependence, and two women did not qualify for a diagnosis. Functional impairment did not differ across diagnoses. A diathesis-stress perspective aided understanding of the clinical expression of psychopathology and creating clinical case formulations. Conclusions: The limited application of a postpartum onset specifier is unsatisfactory. Unless the diverse range of postpartum disorders is properly acknowledged by considering a diathesis-stress perspective and allowing for an onset specifier, the care of women experiencing psychological distress during the postpartum period may have reduced effectiveness and future research will be hindered. \textcopyright 2013 Copyright Society for Reproductive and Infant Psychology.",2013.0,10.1080/02646838.2013.795217,SBCYID2J,0,diathesis,508

AIM: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of sleep disorders among New Zealand high school students. METHODS: The Auckland Sleep Questionnaire (ASQ) was administered to high school students at six schools in the North Island. Schools were chosen to reflect a range of ethnicities and school deciles, which identify the socioeconomic status of households in the school catchment area. RESULTS: A total of 1388 students completed the ASQ. The median age was 17 years (range 14-23) and females represented 43.5 \% (n=604) of the total group. A total of 37.2 \% of the students surveyed reported having significant sleep symptoms lasting longer than one month. Depression and anxiety were present in 51.7 \% and 44.8 \% of students reporting a sleep problem, respectively. A moderate correlation was observed between sleep problems and depression (r=0.34, p \textless 0.01), and sleep problems and anxiety (r=0.31, p \textless 0.01). Problem alcohol use and other substance use were more common in students with sleep symptoms (12.2 \% and 5.5 \% respectively). No difference was found in the rate of sleep problems reported by different ethnic groups. DISCUSSION: A considerable proportion of students surveyed reported significant sleep symptoms. This study has the potential to aid physicians within New Zealand in better appreciating the burden of sleep disorders faced by young people and in effectively assessing and managing different causes of sleep symptoms in this demographic.",2013.0,,6MXTAT5M,0,cognitive_additional,509
509,Self-efficacy as the moderator: Exploring driving factors of perceived social support for mainland Chinese students in Taiwan.,"Liu, Ying Chieh; Hung, Yun Ying","More and more mainland Chinese college students study in Taiwan. Social support is one of the main factors helping them study and live happily in Taiwan. This study aims to investigate the relationships among self-efficacy, social identity, and perceived social support through online social networks in helping mainland Chinese college students improve their adaption ability of diversified campuses in Taiwan. We assume social identity affects positively perceived social support, and self-efficacy served as a moderator of the relationships between social identify and social support. A convenience sample of 366 mainland Chinese students from five universities in Taiwan was conducted to validate the hypotheses. The results revealed that affective and cognitive identification were significantly and positively related to perceived emotional, tangible and informational support. The moderator, self-efficacy, was shown to moderate the three relationships from affective identification to emotional, tangible and informational support. Also, it moderated the relationships from cognitive identification to tangible support, but not the relationships from cognitive identification to emotional and informational support. The suggestions for Taiwanese host universities to lighten the stress of study adaptation of mainland Chinese college students are provided.

510,The role of maternal anxiety in the early postpartum period: screening for anxiety and depressive symptomatology in Greece.,"Giakoumaki, O.; Vasilaki, K.; Lili, L.; Skouroliakou, M.; Liosis, G.","BACKGROUND: From birth to the first year postpartum, there is a critical period for the development of affective disorders. Maternal anxiety has received little attention even though it is associated with a number of adverse outcomes. Symptoms of anxiety often comorbid with depression and pertain a significant role in the maintenance of postpartum distress. The purpose of this study is to assess anxiety and depressive symptomatology in a Greek population and to examine their relationship. This study investigated the demographic and socio-psychological factors that are associated with the onset of the symptoms of postpartum distress. METHOD: The study was conducted at the perinatal hospital Elena Venizelou in Greece. Two hundred thirty-five mothers met the inclusion criteria and participated in the study. The state-trait inventory was administered to screen symptoms of anxiety. It incorporates the state subscale that measures symptoms of temporal anxiety, and trait subscale that measures personality predisposition to anxiety. The Edinburgh postpartum depression scale (EPDS) inventory was administered to screen for symptoms of depression. The first assessment was conducted in 2-3 days after labor and the follow-up assessment was conducted in 3 months postpartum by telephone. A standard survey questionnaire was used for the purposes of collecting the demographic data. RESULTS: Symptoms of postpartum depression had 14.5 \ \% \ of mothers on the first screening and 4.6 \ \% \ at the follow-up (EPDS \ \textgreater \ or= 14). State anxiety symptoms were manifested by 22.9 \ \% \ of the sample on the first screening and 12.6 \ \% \ at the follow-up. Trait anxiety symptoms exhibited 24.6 \ \% \ of the sample on the first screening and 14.3 \ \% \ at the follow-up. There was comorbidity between the symptoms of anxiety and depression. The comorbidity was evident even when the anxiety subscale of the EPDS was removed. State anxiety was correlated with primiparity, admission to the NICU and negative experience of labor. Trait anxiety was correlated with the marital status of the mother. The symptoms of depression were correlated with the young age of the mother and negative experience of labor. CONCLUSION: Symptoms of maternal anxiety are common after labor in Greece and persist in the early postpartum period. This finding suggests that the impact of maternal anxiety should be considered when studying postpartum distress. The comorbidity amongst anxiety and depressive symptomatology persisted at 3 months postpartum making women more vulnerable to postpartum distress. Given this result screening prior to hospital discharge is essential as it can provide an indication of the mothers who are susceptible to developing affective disorders.",2009.0,10.1080/01674820802604839,AHWV3L8U,0,personality,511

512,A double blind placebo controlled randomised clinical trial of pregabalin for alcohol dependence,"Krupitsky, E.; Rybakova, K.; Skurat, E.; Mikhailov, A.; Neznanov, N.","Background: There are several proven effective medications for alcohol dependence, however, most treatments have modes effect size with many non‐responders. There is a need for the development a new effective pharmacotherapy for alcohol dependence. Mediations targeting glutamatergic neurotransmission might be effective in treating alcohol use disorders [1‐3]. Aim: To study the efficacy of pregabalin for relapse prevention and reduction of drinking in patients with alcohol dependence. Methods: One hundred recently detoxified out‐patients with alcohol dependence were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. Patients of the first group (50 subjects; 38 males, 12 females, age (M +/‐ SE) = 43.3 +/‐ 1.7) received pregabalin (150 mg once a day at night time) for 3 months while patients of the second group (50 subjects; 45 males, 5 females, age = 45.9 +/‐ 1.4) received identically looking placebo. All patients received standardized manualized weekly counseling (medical management). Drinking was measured on theweekly basis with Time Line Follow Back technique and GGT enzyme activity. Also, craving for alcohol, depression, and anxiety were measured weekly with the number of scales. The study design was double blind placebo controlled and randomized. Results: Primary outcome‐retention in treatment. Kaplan‐Meier survival analysis demonstrated significantly higher retention in treatment in pregabalin group (lower drop out and relapse rate) (Median (CI) = 12 (10.4‐13.6) weeks in pregabalin group vs. 6 (4.5‐7.5) in placebo group, Log Rank Mantel‐Cox test = 0.005). Proportion of patients who completed treatment in pregabalin group was significantly higher compared to placebo group: 50% vs. 24% (p = 0.01, Fisher exact test). Mean duration of participation in the treatment program was also higher in pregabalin group: 9.1 +/‐ 0.5 weeks vs. 7.1 +/‐ 0.5 in placebo (p = 0.006). Secondary outcomes‐drinking level. General linear model demonstrated significant group effect on: (1)Total alcohol consumption (TAC) (mean grams of alcohol per day) (F = 10.2; p = 0.01) with lower TAC in pregabalin group on weeks 3, 4, 5 and 7, and (2)On the Number of heavy drinking days (NHDD) (F = 7.9; p = 0.05) with lower NHDD in pregabalin group on theweeks 3‐7 and 9. Mean NHDD per patient for the period of participation in the study was lower in pregabalin group (3.6 +/‐ 0.7 vs. 6.4 +/‐ 0.8; p = 0.009), while the mean number of abstinent (sober) days was higher (55.9 +/‐ 3.6 vs. 40.0 +/‐ 3.3; p = 0.001). No significant differences between the two groups were found on the craving for alcohol, depression and anxiety scales. GGT activity was also similar in both groups throughout the study with no significant between group differences. The rate of adverse events (AE) was 22% in pregabalin group vs. 6.1% in placebo group (p = 0.023). The most common AE were sleepiness, headache, and asthenia. All AE were mild, gradually disappeared, and did not require any medication. Conclusion: Results of this study provide evidence that pregabalin in a low does of 150 mg per day is an effective and safe medication for relapse prevention and reduction of drinking in patients with alcohol dependence.",2017.0,,6R2P6SKF,0,additional,513
513,Bilateral bispectral index monitoring during and after electroconvulsive therapy compared with magnetic seizure therapy for treatment-resistant depression.,"Soehle, M.; Kayser, S.; Ellerkmann, R. K.; Schlaepfer, T. E.","BACKGROUND: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a highly effective and established treatment for depression. Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) has recently been developed and seems equally effective while associated with fewer side-effects. Both require general anaesthesia, which could be quantified using the bispectral index (BIS). We compared ECT and MST with respect to recovery times, left-sided BIS, and left-right differences in BIS. METHODS: In this prospective, observational study, we enrolled 10 successive patients receiving ECT and 10 patients undergoing MST. Anaesthesia was performed with propofol and monitored with a bilateral BIS sensor. The seizure was elicited when the BIS was within a range from 50 to 60. The time to eye opening was measured and bilateral BIS were recorded for 10 min after seizure induction. RESULTS: A comparable anaesthetic depth was observed in the ECT and MST groups at baseline [mean (standard deviation, sd) BIS values of 94.1 (4.1) and 95.5 (3.0), respectively] and before seizure induction [mean (sd) BIS values of 52.3 (9.6) and 55.2 (10.3), respectively]. Post-ictally, MST patients opened their eyes significantly earlier than ECT patients [3.0 (1.0) vs 6.7 (1.3) min, P \ \textless \ 0.001]. They showed a significantly higher BIS at 2 min after seizure induction [69.2 (10.1) vs 50.9 (15.9), P=0.003], and this difference was still present at 10 min after seizure induction [BIS 81.5 (6.5) vs 68.0 (16.4), P \ \textless \ 0.001]. Significant differences between the left and right BIS were observed in neither the ECT nor the MST group. CONCLUSIONS: At a comparable anaesthetic depth, MST is superior to ECT in terms of post-ictal recovery, which is correctly reflected by higher post-ictal BIS values. Unilateral BIS monitoring is sufficient to monitor anaesthetic depth in ECT and MST patients. TRIAL REGISTRY NUMBER: NCT 01318018.",2014.0,10.1093/bja/aet410,2C9VAZ3Q,0,personality,514
514,"Gender differences in the consequences of depressive symptomatology for educational attainment, social support, and health risk behavior during the transition from adolescence to young adulthood: Implications for health disparities in mid to late life.","Needham, Belinda Leeann","Using data from three waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, I examine the association between mental health problems experienced early in the life course and factors that impact physical health later in the life course, including educational attainment, social support, and health risk behavior. In addition, I consider whether these associations are conditioned by gender, an important aspect of social structural context. I find that adolescent depression is associated with increased odds of failure to complete high school for girls but not for boys. Among high school graduates of both genders, depressive symptomatology is associated with failure to enter college. In each case, trouble paying attention in school, grade point average, and educational expectations mediate the association between symptoms of depression and school termination. Next, I find that social support and depressive symptomatology interact with one another in a dynamic fashion across the transition from adolescence to young adulthood. Parental support during adolescence is inversely associated with initial symptoms of depression for girls and boys, although adolescent girls with low levels of parental support begin the study period with significantly higher levels of depressive symptomatology than their male counterparts. Furthermore, elevated symptoms of depression during adolescence negatively impact parent-child relationships during young adulthood. This association is stronger for girls than boys. Finally, I find that the association between depressive symptomatology and health risk behaviors is bidirectional. Adolescents who are initially more depressed begin the study period with substantially higher rates of binge drinking and drug use than their better-adjusted peers, yet they are less vulnerable to increases in these health risk behaviors across the transition to young adulthood. Also, adolescents who start out with higher than average cigarette, alcohol, and drug use experience a faster rate of decline in symptoms of depression over time compared to those who start out with lower levels of substance use. This association is more pronounced for girls than boys. Despite their faster rate of decline in depressive symptoms, girls and boys who have higher initial levels of substance use report higher levels of depressive symptomatology at all three time points.

Currently, there is no specific treatment that halts or reverses the progression of RTT. Therefore, management was mainly symptomatic, focussed on optimising patient's abilities. The aim of this study was to investigate factors influencing health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and depression in mothers who care for children with Rett syndrome (RTT) in Serbia. METHODS: The cross-sectional study was conducted on 49 mothers giving care to females with RTT. Caregivers HRQoL was assessed by using the SF-36 questionnaire. Clinical severity score (CSS) of RTT patients and Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI -II) scale were used to quantify RTT severity and mothers' depression, respectively. Statistical assessment included descriptive statistics, t-test, Pearson correlation coefficient and multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: The age of mothers ranged from 22 to 55 years and of their affected children from 3 to 29 years. Severe depression was observed in 15 (30.6 \% ) participants. CSS and BDI-II scores correlated negatively with all SF-36 domains and composite scores. Lowest scoring domains of HRQoL in mothers giving care to RTT children were mental health, vitality and role functioning emotional. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that severity of RTT patients' disability (CSS) and caregivers' age are factors with strongest influence to HRQoL and depression in care giving mothers. CONCLUSION: Mothers giving care to children with RTT are at high risk of severe depression and lower HRQoL scores of domains that reflect mental well-being.

Abbass, Sven Rabung, Falk Leichsenring, Johanne S. Refseth and Nick Midgley (Journal of the American Academy of Child \& Adolescent Psychiatry, 2013[Aug], Vol 52[8], 863-875). In the original article, the author affiliations were incorrectly listed on page 874. The corrected acknowledgments are present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2013-26489-016). Objective: Psychodynamically based brief psychotherapy is frequently used in clinical practice for a range of common mental disorders in children and adolescents. To our knowledge, there have been no meta-analyses to evaluate the effectiveness of these therapies. Method: After a broad search, we meta-analyzed controlled outcome studies of short-term psychodynamic psychotherapies (STPP, 40 or fewer sessions). We also performed sensitivity analyses and evaluated the risk of bias in this body of studies. Results: We found 11 studies with a total of 655 patients covering a broad range of conditions including depression, anxiety disorders, anorexia nervosa, and borderline personality disorder. STPP did not separate from what were mostly robust treatment comparators, but there were some subgroup differences. Robust (g = 1.07, 95 \% CI = 0.80-1.34) within group effect sizes were observed suggesting the treatment may be effective. These effects increased in follow up compared to post treatment (overall, g = 0.24, 95 \% CI = 0.00-0.48), suggesting a tendency toward increased gains. Heterogeneity was high across most analyses, suggesting that these data need be interpreted with caution. Conclusion: This review suggests that STPP may be effective in children and adolescents across a range of common mental disorders.

517,Affective updating ability and stressful events interact to prospectively predict increases in depressive symptoms over time.,"Pe, Madeline L.; Brose, Annette; Gotlib, Ian H.; Kuppens, Peter","Previous research has emphasized the critical role of negative cognitions as a vulnerability factor in predicting depressive symptoms. Here, the authors argue that processes that function to maintain negative cognitions may serve as a catalyst for the development of depressive symptoms in the context of negative circumstances, and they suggest that poor updating of affective information in working memory is 1 such process. Thus, they posit that under high levels of stress, individuals with poor affective updating are hindered in changing the negative content in working memory associated with stressful events and, therefore, are more likely to experience increased depressive symptoms over time. To examine this hypothesis, the authors assessed affective updating ability, stress, and depressive symptoms in 200 students who were entering their first year of tertiary education. They assessed levels of depressive symptoms again both 4 months and 1 year later. Under high levels of stress, poor affective updating ability was associated with an increase in depressive symptoms at both 4 months and 1 year later. These results demonstrate that affective updating ability is an important cognitive vulnerability factor that interacts with stressful events to accelerate the development of depressive symptoms, and underscore the importance of designing early prevention or intervention approaches for individuals with this cognitive vulnerability.

518,Identity and individuality in the nouveau-religious patient: theoretical and clinical aspects.,"Spero, M. H.","Revitalized interest in the clinical complexities of psychotherapy with religious patients (for example, Bradford 1984; Lovinger 1984; Spero 1985a; Stern 1985) has drawn attention to the need for perspectives on religious personality development that account for healthy and adaptational aspects as well as psychopathological aspects of particular forms and levels of religious beliefs, enabling more creative, enriching psychotherapy. This search represents movement beyond the significance of infantile wish-fulfillment aspects of religiosity toward the broader domain of ego functioning and quality of object relations. Rizzuto (1976, 1979) and McDargh (1983) emphasize qualitative similarities between interpersonal object representations and God representations. Elkind (1971), using a Piagetian model, views religious beliefs and rituals as forms of constructive adaptation to normal cognitive needs for conservation, representation, symbols of relation, and comprehension. Meissner (1984) highlights the role of God concepts as transitional phenomena. In earlier papers, I have demonstrated the relationship between patients' use of religious themes and legends, quality of psychosexual and object relational achievements, and the consolidation of religious identity (Spero 1982a,b, 1986a,b). Throughout the preceding there is unequivocal recognition that religious development recapitulates many important aspects of healthy psychological development, and that in the case of pathological or dysfunctional religiosity something has gone wrong in an otherwise normal process. There is need to understand and if necessary distinguish between the development of religious belief in individuals whose ideological commitment is relatively constant from earliest childhood and its development in those who adopt or modify religious belief in later life, in conjunction with the many technical implications for psychotherapy. Clinical experience has taught that the process of religious change in later life represents a significant psychosocial crisis, requiring certain important psychological tasks in order to achieve successful resolution. In some instances, generally when there are preexisting difficulties or psychiatric disorders, the process of ideological change, either at the onset or during subsequent stages, takes on psychopathological momentum and quality. Clinicians who intervene at this juncture are confronted with patients whose primary complaints include malfunction in their religious lives or misuse of religious metaphor or behavior enmeshed with mild to serious personality disorder.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1987.0,,SS84VWE5,0,personality,519

To test the efficacy of the intervention, pre- and post-intervention evaluation of internalising symptoms and coping ability were compared with waiting-list control groups (matched according to ethnic group, gender, and school level). One hundred and six primary and ninety-eight high school students differentiated by cultural origin (former-Yugoslavian, Chinese, and mixed-ethnic) and school level (primary and high school), completed standardised measures of internalising symptoms and were allocated to either an intervention (n = 121) or a waiting-list (n = 83) condition. Both groups were readministered the assessment package for comparison following a 10-week treat- ment or waiting period. Consistent with a recent pilot study, pre/post-assessment indicated that participants in the intervention condition exhibited lower anxiety and a more positive future outlook than waiting-list participants. Participating students reported to be highly satisfied with the intervention. Despite the overall success of FRIENDS, the program may be enhanced by culturally sensitive supplements so that the program is more applicable for use with NESB participants. Suggestions for treatment program modifications of FRIENDS are discussed. T he stress and anxiety that accompanies migration and cultural adjustment in children and adolescents has been widely documented in recent years (Barrett, Moore, \& Sonderegger, 2000; Evans \& Lee, 1998; Grunbaum, 1997).

520,Learning racism in the absence of 'race'.,"Svendsen, Stine H. Bang","How do students learn about racism in the absence of 'race' as an explanatory concept for current social divisions? This article traces conceptual and affective negotiations of 'race' and racism in a Norwegian middle school classroom. Conceptual confusion about 'race', racism and lines of inclusion and exclusion in the nation is rife in this educational setting, where the curricular focus is on questions of immigration and integration. Treating 'race' as a 'chameleon-like' concept that adapts to the cultural context and political situation, the analysis highlights the emotional investments and injuries that discussing race brings forward in the situation through a Kleinian psychoanalytic lens. Working through the affective as well as the conceptual aspects of the classroom's struggles with 'race' and racism, the article argues that racism is enacted in the classroom partly as an effect of the denial of 'race' as a current effect of racism. Furthermore, it suggests that the denial of 'race' as an explanatory concept veils racial binaries that are enacted through Norwegian ethnonationalism, and facilitates enactment of racist dynamics in education that is intended to prevent racism.

L.","OBJECTIVE: The possible heterogeneity of the schizophrenia-related personality disorder traits associated with DSM-III criteria for schizotypal personality disorder was investigated using the family history method. A familial relationship to schizophrenia was hypothesized for schizophrenia-related personality disorder traits without coexisting affective personality disorder traits, pure schizophrenia-related personality disorder traits. Alternatively, a familial relationship with borderline personality disorder was hypothesized for schizophrenia-related personality disorder traits with comorbid affective personality disorder traits. METHOD: Criteria for schizophrenia-related and affective personality disorder traits were used to assess the 588 nonpsychotic first-degree relatives of 55 chronic schizophrenic probands and 67 probands with personality disorders. The probands with one or more DSM-III personality disorders were categorized as having schizotypal personality disorder without borderline personality disorder (pure schizotypal personality disorder), borderline personality disorder without schizotypal personality disorder (pure borderline personality disorder), both disorders, or neither. RESULTS: The morbid risk of all cases of schizophrenia-related personality disorder traits was higher in relatives of probands with schizophrenia and pure schizotypal personality disorder than in relatives of probands with neither schizotypal nor borderline personality disorder; however, it differed only slightly from that observed in the relatives of probands with both schizotypal and borderline personality disorders and pure borderline personality disorder. In contrast, the risk of pure schizophrenia-related personality disorder traits was higher in relatives of probands with schizophrenia and pure schizotypal personality disorder, while the risk of coexisting schizophrenia-related and affective personality disorder traits was lower in both of these groups than among the relatives of probands with both schizotypal and borderline personality disorders and pure borderline personality disorder. CONCLUSIONS: These results offer preliminary indications that schizotypal personality disorder features present without comorbid affective personality disorder traits may more specifically characterize the personality characteristics familially related to schizophrenia. Furthermore, they indicate that schizotypal personality disorder features as currently defined are found in relatives of patients other than those with schizophrenia or schizotypal personality disorder.",1993.0,10.1176/ajp.150.3.435,ES2QJJ8G,0,personality,522
522,Oxytocin promotes protective behavior in depressed mothers: A pilot study with the enthusiastic stranger paradigm,"Mah, Beth L.; Bakermans-Kranenburg, Marian J. and","Background: Successful parenting requires maternal behaviors that promote infant survival such as protection from predators. In animal studies, oxytocin (OT) has been linked to maternal aggression to protect offspring. No human study has explored this topic. Mothers with a diagnosis of postnatal depression (PND) are at higher risk of neglecting their infants. We hypothesized that intranasal OT administration would increase the protective behaviors of mothers with PND, toward their infants. Methods: Sixteen mothers with a diagnosis of PND participated in a double-blind, randomized-controlled, within-subject pilot study. Participants received intranasal OT during one visit and placebo spray on the alternate visit. Maternal protective behavior toward their infant was measured, in the presence of a socially intrusive stranger. Results: The enthusiastic stranger paradigm stimulated participants' protective responses in the presence of an intrusive stranger. Furthermore, this protective response of mothers with a diagnosis of PND was increased in the OT condition. Conclusions: The study introduces a new paradigm, the enthusiastic stranger paradigm, which may be used to examine a neglected type of parental behavior, that is, protection of offspring. The protective response of mothers with PND increased, in line with the 'tend and defend' effects of OT in animal models. In future work it should be tested whether this protection effect can also be found in nonclinical samples, or whether it is specific for clinically depressed mothers.

523,maternal bliss revisited: An exploration of postpartum struggles in motherhood.,"Cardona, Gabriella","This study examined conceptualizations of the maternal role and postpartum experiences through socio-cultural, historical, feministic, and psychoanalytic perspectives of motherhood. Particular attention was paid to how cultural idealizations of the maternal experience, as well as the strict dichotimization between normative and pathological notions of motherhood perpetuated by psychiatric models of mothering, continue to refute the ubiquity of maternal struggles for all women. The study specifically investigated maternal hardship and subjectivity through its exploration of the personal experience of motherhood from the perspective of seven American mothers. A total of 7 semi-structured interviews were conducted with women between the ages of 28 and 35 who varied in their experience of motherhood, including women who had minimal difficulty in their transition to those who had more difficulty, such as those participants who self-identified as having Postpartum Depression. A thematic analysis of the data demonstrated several significant themes of maternal crises for all participants. Case analyses of three women who experienced Postpartum Depression were then examined in depth, exploring commonalities and differences among these participants. Results challenged the notion that postnatal depression is a fixed and predetermined illness that lives outside of and separate from the normal postpartum period. Similarities in themes between all participants helped to support the idea that postpartum crises exist on a continuum of maternal experience, and demonstrated the importance of understanding motherhood from the perspective of the maternal subject.

Clinically referred children (aged 8 to 12) diagnosed with Separation Anxiety Disorder (n = 52), Generalised Anxiety Disorder (n = 37), Social Phobia (n = 22) or Specific Phobia (n = 16) were randomly assigned to individual (n = 65) or group (n = 62) treatment. METHOD: Analyses were conducted separately for the intent-to-treat sample and the sample of children who completed treatment. Analyses included chi-square comparisons and regression analyses with treatment format as a predictor. RESULTS: Forty-eight percent of the children in the individual versus 41 \% in the group treatment were free of any anxiety disorder at post-treatment; 62 \% versus 54 \% were free of their primary anxiety disorder. Regression analyses showed no significant difference in outcome between individual and group treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Children improved in both conditions. Choice between treatments could be based on pragmatic considerations such as therapeutic resources, referral rates, and the preference of the parents and the child.",2008.0,10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.01877.x,A6XFTXNZ,0,cognitive,525
525,"Is State Anxiety, Trait Anxiety, or Anxiety Sensitivity a Clinical Predictor of Symptoms in Those Presenting With Mild Traumatic Brain Injury or Concussion?","Hixson, K. M.; Allen, A. N.; Williams, A. S.; McLeod, T. C. V.","Clinical Scenario: Mild traumatic brain injury, or concussion, has been associated with physical, cognitive, and emotional sequelae. Little is understood in regard to many characteristics, such as anxiety, and their effect on post-concussion symptoms. CLINICAL QUESTION: Is state anxiety, trait anxiety, or anxiety sensitivity a clinical predictor of symptoms in those presenting with mild traumatic brain injury or concussion? Summary of Key Findings: A literature search returned 3 possible studies; 3 studies met inclusion criteria and included. One study reported in athletes that greater social support was associated with decreased state-anxiety, lower state anxiety post-concussion was associated with increased social support, and that those with greater social support may experience reduced anxiety, regardless of injury type sustained. One study reported baseline trait anxiety in athletes was not significantly associated with post-concussion state anxiety, but that symptoms of depression at baseline was the strongest predictor for post-concussion state anxiety. Three studies reported that state and trait anxiety are not related to increased post-concussion symptom scores. One study reported that greater anxiety sensitivity is related to higher reported post-concussion symptom scores, which may manifest as somatic symptoms following concussion, and revealed that anxiety sensitivity may be a risk factor symptom development. Clinical Bottom Line: There is low-level to moderate evidence to support that anxiety sensitivity is linked to post-concussion symptoms. State and trait anxiety do not appear to be related to post-concussion symptoms alone. Post-concussion state anxiety may occur if post-concussion symptoms of depression are present or if baseline symptoms of depression are present. Better social support may improve state anxiety post-concussion. Strength of Recommendation: There is grade B evidence to support that state and trait anxiety are not risk factors for post-concussion symptom development. There is grade C evidence to support anxiety sensitivity as a risk factor for developing post-concussion symptoms.",2017.0,10.1123/jsr.2016-0122,K5QA2K9A,0,additional,526

Three instruments were employed: The South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and the Cognitive Error Questionnaire (CEQ). An investigation was conducted using 96 male undergraduate fraternity members. Pearson's correlation coefficients were completed, followed by a multiple regression equation with gambling behavior entered as the criterion variable and depression and cognitive errors entered as predictor variables. Significant correlations were found among all three variables (p \textless .01). When added to depression, cognitive errors did not help predict problem gambling.

528,Association of social-environmental factors with cognitive function in children with sickle cell disease,"Yarboi, J.; Compas, B. E.; Brody, G. H.; White, D. and","The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between cognitive function in pediatric sickle cell disease (SCD) patients and mothers' reports of social-environmental stress, depressive symptoms, and parenting. A total of 65 children with SCD completed comprehensive neuropsychological testing to assess several domains of cognitive functioning, including general intellectual ability, academic achievement, and executive function. Mothers reported on demographics, social-environmental stress, depressive symptoms, and parenting. As predicted, children with SCD significantly underperformed relative to normative data on measures of cognitive function. Associations between maternal social-environmental stress, maternal depressive symptoms, and parenting were mixed. The results show partial support for the hypothesis that greater stress and depressive symptoms and less positive parenting are associated with poorer cognitive function in children with SCD. Linear regression analyses showed that maternal financial stress was the strongest predictor across all domains of cognitive function. The findings replicate and extend past research, reaffirming that children with SCD are at risk for cognitive impairment across multiple domains. Additionally, social-environmental stress, particularly financial strain, is linked to mothers' depressive symptoms and parenting behaviors as well as children's cognitive function. Future studies using direct observations of parenting behaviors are needed. These findings, along with recent research on parenting interventions, may inform the development of concrete, teachable parenting and coping skills to improve cognitive functioning in children with SCD.",2015.0,10.1080/09297049.2015.1111318,253WGTTI,0,diathesis,529
529,Self-efficacy beliefs mediate the relationship between subjective cognitive functioning and physical and mental well-being after hematopoietic stem cell transplant.,"Wu, Lisa M.; Austin, Jane; Hamilton, Jada G.; Valdimarsdottir, Heiddis; Isola, Luis; Rowley, Scott; Warbet, Rachel; Winkel, Gary; Redd, William H.; Rini, Christine","OBJECTIVE: Cognitive problems are commonly reported by hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) survivors and are associated with poorer physical and mental well-being. It was hypothesized that adverse effects of subjective cognitive impairment occur because cognitive difficulties reduce survivors' confidence that they can manage HSCT-related symptoms-that is, self-efficacy for symptom management. METHODS: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant survivors (n = 245), 9 months to 3 years post-HSCT, completed measures of subjective cognitive functioning, self-efficacy for symptom management, and clinically important outcomes: depressed mood, anxiety, and quality of life. Mediation analyses using bootstrapping were conducted to investigate whether effects of subjective cognitive impairment on these outcomes were mediated by self-efficacy for cognitive, emotional (SE-Emotional), social (SE-Social), and physical (SE-Physical) symptom management. RESULTS: Self-efficacy mediated relations between subjective cognitive impairment and depressed mood (total indirect effect = -0.0064 and 95 \% CI -0.0097 to -0.0036), anxiety (total indirect effect = -0.0045, CI -0.0072 to -0.0021), and quality of life (total indirect effect = 0.0952, CI 0.0901 to 0.2642). SE-Emotional was a unique mediator when the outcome was depressed mood and anxiety. SE-Social, SE-Physical, and SE-Emotional were specific mediators when outcome was quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the conclusion that subjective cognitive impairment reduces HSCT survivors' confidence in their ability to manage common post-HSCT symptoms, with implications for physical and mental well-being. Interventions that help enhance survivors' self-efficacy, particularly self-efficacy for the management of emotional symptoms, are likely to benefit HSCT survivors who report subjective cognitive impairment.",2012.0,10.1002/pon.2012,PY8AQJT5,0,cognitive,530

S.; Damez-Werno, D.; Scobie, K.; Bagot, R.; LaBont","$\beta$-catenin is a multi-functional protein that has an important role in the mature central nervous system; its dysfunction has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression. Here we show that in mice $\beta$-catenin mediates pro-resilient and anxiolytic effects in the nucleus accumbens, a key brain reward region, an effect mediated by D2-type medium spiny neurons. Using genome-wide $\beta$-catenin enrichment mapping, we identify Dicer1 - important in small RNA (for example, microRNA) biogenesis - as a $\beta$-catenin target gene that mediates resilience. Small RNA profiling after excising $\beta$-catenin from nucleus accumbens in the context of chronic stress reveals $\beta$-catenin-dependent microRNA regulation associated with resilience. Together, these findings establish $\beta$-catenin as a critical regulator in the development of behavioural resilience, activating a network that includes Dicer1 and downstream microRNAs. We thus present a foundation for the development of novel therapeutic targets to promote stress resilience.",2014.0,10.1038/nature13976,IR6KJBCQ,0,diathesis,531

The coexistence of contradictory, secondary identifications, partly characterized by intrasystemic conflicts, in the ego and superego (e.g. the existence of the peaceful and the warlike ege as 'doubles'), producing a multiple personality in which the formation of the ego ideal, moulded by themes of terror, threatens to exert a transgenerational influence owing to a superego identification with the Nazi aspects of the father, while the 'borrowed guilt' from the father corresponds to a melancholic identification; the regressive concretization in the form of a transitory delusion also belongs to the context of the latter. A restitutive, self-curative identification with figures in world literature and cultural values capable of linking up with a pretraumatic past not personally experienced and of countering the threat of loss of orientation to the world--a feature which seems comparable to the struggle for attainment of the depressive position as described by Melanie Klein.

In addition, we have previously shown that patients with Dementia sleep longer. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that objective nighttime and daytime sleep is associated with inflammation among patients with Dementia. Methods: A sub-sample of 53 patients with Dementia, were recruited from a large, population-based cohort in the island of Crete, Greece of 3140 older adults (>60yrs). The overall goal of this study was to assess the prevalence and risk factors associated with cognitive impairment. All participants underwent medical history/physical examination, extensive neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological evaluation, 3-day 24-h actigraphy and a single morning IL-6 and TNFa plasma level. Associations between inflammatory markers and sleep variables, were assessed using Linear Regression Analysis controlling for gender, age, BMI and depressive symptoms. Results: Mean age of our participants was 80.3 (SD = 5.71) years and 34% were male. Peripheral levels of IL-6 (mean ± SD) and TNFa in patients with Dementia were 1.49 ± 0.95 (pgr/ml) and 1.30 ± 0.58 (pgr/ ml), respectively. Regression analyses revealed associations between IL-6 and daytime Sleep Efficiency (r=0.427, p=0.019), daytime Total Time in Bed (r=0.327, p=0.078), nighttime Sleep Latency (r=-0.312, p=0.018), and day and night Total Sleep Time (r=0.223, p=0.096). Conclusion: These data indicate that prolonged nighttime and daytime sleep is associated with increased levels of sleep-inducing pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in patients with dementia. Furthermore, extended sleep and sleepiness is a marker of generalized inflammation in demented patients and may be an adverse prognostic sign of coarse of the disease.

The objective of this study was to determine whether remitted depressed patients show alterations in connectivity of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC, a node in the default mode network) with the parahippocampal gyri (PHG, a region associated with autobiographical memory) while intensively recalling negative memories and whether this is related to daily life symptoms and to the further course of depression. Sad mood was induced with keywords of personal negative life events in participants with remitted depression (n = 29) and matched healthy controls (n = 29) during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Additionally, daily life assessments of mood and rumination and a 6-month follow-up were conducted. Remitted depressed participants showed greater connectivity than healthy controls of the PCC with the PHG, which was even stronger in patients with more previous episodes. Furthermore, patients with increased PCC-PHG connectivity showed a sadder mood and more rumination in daily life and a worsening of rumination and depression scores during follow-up. A relationship of negative autobiographical memory processing, rumination, sad mood and depression on a neural level seems likely. The identified increased connectivity probably indicates a 'scar' of recurrent depression and may represent a prognostic factor for future depression.",2014.0,10.1093/scan/nsu006,5A9D7VE6,0,cognitive_additional,535

However, recent research with adults affected by either type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus demonstrates that relatively mild hyperglycaemia is associated with unpleasant symptoms and cognitive disruptions. Both hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia can be associated with patient experiences of physical, affective, and cognitive symptoms, as well as cognitive-motor disruptions. These effects can lead to impaired functioning and quality of life. Because these effects are different across patients, their significance can be difficult to appreciate. There is ample evidence that acute hypoglycaemia is a problem for both adults with type 1 and those with type 2 diabetes, and that mild and moderate hypoglycaemia reduce one's mental efficiency relative to euglycaemic performance. There is growing evidence that transient hyperglycaemia has similar negative effects. At relatively mild levels of extreme blood glucose--either hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia--cognitive efficiency may decay by a third. The impact of this effect will depend on the task the patient is dealing with at the time. If the person is engaging in a relatively dangerous task, such as driving a vehicle, significant consequences could follow. Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia have been demonstrated to have not only acute, but also chronic effects in patients with type 1 as well as those with type 2 diabetes. Although hypoglycaemia occurs at a lower rate among patients with type 2 diabetes than among those with type 1, the number of patients with type 2 diabetes is so large that even this low rate results in many persons being affected.",2002.0,,WLX6JIXW,0,cognitive,536

Published reports regarding its fetal safety are contradictory. We aimed to establish the fetal safety of the drug. Method: We performed a systematic review of the literature, searching PubMed, Medline, and Embase from inception to August 31, 2012, for cohort and case-control studies in which women were exposed to fluoxetine during the first trimester and compared outcomes with those of unexposed control subjects. Results: Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. The odds ratio for major malformations associated with maternal fluoxetine use in cohort studies was 1.12 (95 \% CI 0.98 to 1.28). The studies included were homogeneous. Fifteen cohort studies evaluated cardiac malformations and yielded an overall odds ratio of 1.6 (95 \% CI 1.31 to 1.95). These studies also were homogeneous. In contrast, two case-control studies assessing cardiac malformations yielded a combined odds ratio of 0.63 (95 \% CI 0.39 to 1.03). Conclusion: The apparent increased risk of fetal cardiac malformations associated with maternal use of fluoxetine has recently been shown also in depressed women who deferred SSRI therapy in pregnancy, and therefore most probably reflects an ascertainment bias. Overall, women who are treated with fluoxetine during the first trimester of pregnancy do not appear to have an increased risk of major fetal malformations.",2013.0,10.1016/S1701-2163(15)30965-8,IWQP88GS,0,cognitive_additional,538

F.","The HIV prevalence and incidence among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China are high. Unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) with a regular male sex partner (RP), a significant predictor of HIV sero-conversion, was high yet under-emphasized among MSM having RP (MSMRP). The present cross-sectional survey interviewed 307 HIV negative MSMRP recruited through convenient sampling from multiple sources, including venue-based outreaching, online recruitment, and referrals made by peers, in Beijing and Chengdu, China. Among MSMRP, the prevalence of UAI with RP in the last three months was 52.4 \% . The results of the multivariate analysis showed that trust and intimacy within the relationship with RP and presence of clinical depression symptoms were positively associated with UAI with RP in the last three months. Other associated scalar factors derived from the Theory of Planned Behavior were related to perceptions on condom use, including positive attitudes toward condom use (a negative association), subjective norm of the perception that MSM do not usually use condoms during anal intercourse with RP (a positive association), perceived behavioral control over condom use with RP (a negative association), and behavioral intention to use condoms with RP in the coming three months (a negative association). It is seen that MSMRP were at high risk of HIV/STD transmission. The associated factors hence involved those related to perceptions about condom use, mental health, and interpersonal relationship. Future interventions should take these multi-dimensional factors into account. In particular, future research to test the efficacy of couple-based interventions that include mental health elements needs to be conducted, as trust and intimacy within the relationship were associated with UAI among MSMRP, and mental health problems may exist for both the MSMRP and their RP.",2015.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0119977,TS9RUHFM,0,cognitive,540
540,Childhood emotional maltreatment and later psychological distress among college students: the mediating role of maladaptive schemas.,"Wright, Margaret O'Dougherty; Crawford, Emily and","OBJECTIVE: Theoretically, exposure to experiences of emotional abuse (EA) and emotional neglect (EN) in childhood may threaten the security of attachment relationships and result in maladaptive models of self and self-in-relation to others. The purpose of this study was to explore the extent to which EA and EN treatment by parents contributed uniquely to young adult maladaptive long-term outcome with respect to symptoms of anxiety, depression, and dissociation. The extent to which the relationships between EA and EN and later symptoms were mediated by specific internalized maladaptive interpersonal schemas was also explored. METHODS: Questionnaires completed by 301 college men and women (52 \% female) assessed perceptions of experiences of childhood abuse and neglect, exposure to parental alcoholism, current symptoms of psychological distress, and endorsement of maladaptive interpersonal schemas. RESULTS: Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that perceptions of childhood EA and EN each continued to exert an influence on later symptoms after controlling for gender, income, parental alcoholism, and other child abuse experiences. Both EA and EN were associated with later symptoms of anxiety and depression and were mediated by schemas of vulnerability to harm, shame, and self-sacrifice. Only EN was related to later symptoms of dissociation; this relationship was mediated by the schemas of shame and vulnerability to harm. CONCLUSION: The findings are discussed from an attachment perspective, focusing on how early interactions with parents contribute to the development of internal working models of self and self-in-relation to others that influence later cognitive schemas and psychological adjustment. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Although emotional abuse and emotional neglect are the least studied of all forms of child maltreatment, they may be the most prevalent. The current findings suggest that how college students have evaluated and internalized these experiences may be even more important than the events themselves in determining the extent to which these experiences exert a long-term impact. For this reason, early intervention might be particularly important in helping to modify internal working models of the self as worthless, others as abusive, or the world as threatening and dangerous as a result of past abuse experiences. This study underscores the need for counselors to actively elicit and explore experiences of emotional abuse and neglect in clients, in addition to inquiring about other abuse experiences and types of family dysfunction. The results of this study also support existing data suggesting that internalized representational models of self and others are a key mechanism underlying the relationship between emotional maltreatment and later psychopathology. Young's schema questionnaire proved to be quite sensitive in detecting specific maladaptive schemas that mediated later difficulties with depression, anxiety, and dissociation. Targeting these negative schemas in therapy may help to ameliorate such symptoms. The therapeutic relationship provides a particularly effective context for developing more positive models of self and others, as well as providing a context to explore core relationship themes across different relationship contexts (e.g., intimate partner, parent, friend, and work relationships). In particular, if the assessment of the client reveals that dissociative symptoms are present, counselors can acknowledge the adaptive function that this strategy once served, while also addressing potential limitations to over-reliance on this coping strategy.",2009.0,10.1016/j.chiabu.2008.12.007,73KDRGJ4,0,diathesis,541

The aim of this paper was to examine the association between major depression and cigarette smoking among young adults in a birth cohort before and after adjusting for confounding factors. Method. Data were gathered over the course of the Christchurch Health and Development Study (CHDS). The CHDS is a longitudinal study of a birth cohort of 1265 New Zealand children studied to age 21. Data were gathered by interview on: (a) major depression over the period 16-21 years; (b) daily smoking and nicotine dependence over the period from 16-21 years. In addition, the study included extensive information on social, family, and behavioural factors in childhood and adolescence. Results. Young people meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depression had elevated rates of daily smoking and nicotine dependence. These associations were reduced substantially by control for potential confounding child and adolescent factors. Nonetheless, even after such control, major depression was associated with increased rates of daily smoking (IRR = 1.19; 95 \% CI = 1.03, 1.39) and elevated rates of nicotine dependence (OR = 1.75; 95 \% CI = 1.13, 2.70). Conclusions. The results suggest that much of the association between smoking and depression reflects common confounding factors that are associated with both outcomes. Nonetheless, even after control for these factors there is evidence of a possible causal linkage between smoking and depression. The direction of causality between smoking and depression remains unknown.",2003.0,10.1017/S0033291703008596,SQZDLDXF,0,cognitive_additional,542
542,Effect of action-based cognitive remediation on cognition and neural activity in bipolar disorder: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Ott, C. V.; Vinberg, M.; Bowie, C. R.; Christensen, E. M.; Knudsen, G. M.; Kessing, L. V.; Miskowiak, K. W.","Background: Cognitive impairment is present in bipolar disorder (BD) during the acute and remitted phases and hampers functional recovery. However, there is currently no clinically available treatment with direct and lasting effects on cognitive impairment in BD. We will examine the effect of a novel form of cognitive remediation, action‐based cognitive remediation (ABCR), on cognitive impairment in patients with BD, and explore the neural substrates of potential treatment efficacy on cognition. Methods/design: The trial has a randomized, controlled, parallel‐group design. In total, 58 patients with BD in full or partial remission aged 18‐55 years with objective cognitive impairment will be recruited. Participants are randomized to 10 weeks of ABCR or a control group. Assessments encompassing neuropsychological testing and mood ratings, and questionnaires on subjective cognitive complaints, psychosocial functioning, and quality of life are carried out at baseline, after 2 weeks of treatment, after the end of treatment, and at a six‐month‐follow‐up after treatment completion. Functional magnetic resonance imaging scans are performed at baseline and 2 weeks into treatment. The primary outcome is a cognitive composite score spanning verbal memory, attention, and executive function. Two complete data sets for 52 patients will provide a power of 80% to detect a clinically relevant between‐group difference on the primary outcome. Behavioral data will be analyzed using mixed models in SPSS while MRI data will be analyzed with the FMRIB Expert Analysis Tool (FEAT). Early treatment‐related changes in neural activity from baseline to week 2 will be investigated for the dorsal prefrontal cortex and hippocampus as the regions of interest and with an exploratory whole‐brain analysis. Discussion: The results will provide insight into whether ABCR has beneficial effects on cognition and functioning in remitted patients with BD. The results will also provide insight into early changes in neural activity associated with improvement of cognition, which can aid future treatment development.

543,Co-morbid major depression and generalized anxiety disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey follow-up.,"Kessler, R. C.; Gruber, M.; Hettema, J. M.; Hwang, I.; Sampson, N.; Yonkers, K. A.","BACKGROUND: Although generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive episode (MDE) are known to be highly co-morbid, little prospective research has examined whether these two disorders predict the subsequent first onset or persistence of the other or the extent to which other predictors explain the time-lagged associations between GAD and MDE. METHOD: Data were analyzed from the nationally representative two-wave panel sample of 5001 respondents who participated in the 1990-1992 National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) and the 2001-2003 NCS follow-up survey. Both surveys assessed GAD and MDE. The baseline NCS also assessed three sets of risk factors that are considered here: childhood adversities, parental history of mental-substance disorders, and respondent personality. RESULTS: Baseline MDE significantly predicted subsequent GAD onset but not persistence. Baseline GAD significantly predicted subsequent MDE onset and persistence. The associations of each disorder with the subsequent onset of the other attenuated with time since onset of the temporally primary disorder, but remained significant for over a decade after this onset. The risk factors predicted onset more than persistence. Meaningful variation was found in the strength and consistency of associations between risk factors and the two disorders. Controls for risk factors did not substantially reduce the net cross-lagged associations of the disorders with each other. CONCLUSIONS: The existence of differences in risk factors for GAD and MDE argues against the view that the two disorders are merely different manifestations of a single underlying internalizing syndrome or that GAD is merely a prodrome, residual, or severity marker of MDE.",2008.0,10.1017/S0033291707002012,KMD7LCE5,0,personality,544

J.; Baker, A. L.; Palazzi, K.; Lewin, T. J.; Kelly, B. J.","PURPOSE: This study sought to undertake an exploratory analysis of the impact of therapeutic alliance and dysfunctional attitudes (perfectionism and need for approval) on outcomes for participants receiving therapist‐delivered and eHealth interventions for comorbid depression and alcohol/cannabis use problems. These factors have been shown in previous research to moderate response to psychological treatment for depression and related disorders. METHOD: Participants (N = 274) with concurrent depression and alcohol/cannabis misuse were randomized to 10 sessions of therapist‐delivered cognitive behavior therapy/motivational interviewing (CBT/MI), computer‐delivered CBT/MI with brief therapist assistance (SHADE CBT/MI), or supportive counseling (PCT). Follow‐up occurred at 3, 6, and 12 months post‐baseline. Exploratory moderator analyses examined changes in depression, alcohol use, and cannabis use over the 3‐12‐month follow‐up timepoints, adjusting for baseline, as a function of treatment allocation, and the hypothesized moderators of therapeutic alliance, perfectionism, and need for approval. RESULTS: The sample size and number of comparisons in the analysis mean that the results are considered preliminary and need replication in larger trials. The analysis revealed that ""client initiative,"" a subscale of therapeutic alliance, moderated change in depression scores between 3‐ and 12‐month follow‐up for the PCT group, with higher scores associated with decreases in depression over time. Higher therapeutic ""bond"" early in treatment for SHADE CBT/MI participants was associated with reduced cannabis use over time. Participants with higher ""perfectionism"" scores at baseline who received therapist CBT/MI reported increases in depression over the follow‐up period, but reductions in depression if they received SHADE CBT/MI. Therapist CBT/MI participants high on ""need for approval"" at baseline reported better alcohol use outcomes over time. CONCLUSION: The preliminary nature of these results do not justify firm conclusions. However, the specific variables of perfectionism, need for approval, and client initiative show promise as moderators of treatment efficacy for comorbid depression and alcohol/cannabis use problems. Further research is justified to determine whether these factors can assist in tailoring the modality and strategies offered in the delivery of psychotherapy to this population.",2017.0,10.1007/s12529-017-9676-x,8WUGQNH7,0,additional,545

The purpose was to assess attentional networks in euthymic patients with unipolar depression using the Attentional Network Test (ANT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated performance of attention by virtue of ANT during remission from unipolar depressive disorder and tested a hypothesis that there are no differences between outpatient group (euthymic patients, N=32) and matched controls in attentional variables, the relationship of attentional networks and everyday cognitive failures. RESULTS: No differences between the groups in attentional networks were found and no relationship between attentional networks and cognitive failures was found. LIMITATIONS: One assessment during remission could be insufficient to recognize long-term pattern of cognitive functions. CONCLUSIONS: These data show non-impaired attentional networks possibly explained by sufficient level of remission and ameliorated influence of high education on cognition.",2010.0,10.1016/j.eurpsy.2009.08.007,QQM54G9A,0,cognitive,546
546,Do baseline characteristics accurately discriminate between patients likely versus unlikely to benefit from implantable defibrillator therapy? Evaluation of the Canadian implantable defibrillator study implantable cardioverter defibrillatory efficacy scor,"Exner, D. V.; Sheldon, R. S.; Pinski, S. L.; Kron, J.; Hallstrom, A.","OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to evaluate whether baseline characteristics predictive of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) efficacy in the Canadian Implantable Defibrillator Study (CIDS) are predictive in the Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillators (AVID) Trial. BACKGROUND: ICD therapy is superior to antiarrhythmic drug use in patients with life-threatening arrhythmias. However, identification of subgroups most likely to benefit from ICD therapy may be useful. Data from CIDS suggest that 3 characteristics (age \textgreater or =70 years, ejection fraction [EF] II) can be combined to reliably categorize patients as likely ( \textgreater or =2 characteristics) versus unlikely to benefit ( \textless 2 characteristics) from ICD therapy. METHODS: The utility of the CIDS categorization of ICD efficacy was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox hazards modeling. The accuracy of the CIDS score was formally tested by evaluating for interaction between categorization of benefit and treatment in a Cox model. RESULTS: ICD therapy was associated with a significantly lower risk of death in the 320 patients categorized as likely to benefit (relative risk [RR] 0.57, 95 \% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.88, P =.01) and a trend toward a lower risk of death in the 689 patients categorized as unlikely to benefit (RR 0.70, 95 \% CI 0.48-1.03, P =.07). Categorization of benefit was imperfect, as evidenced by a lack of statistical interaction (P =.5). Although 32 of the 42 deaths prevented by ICD therapy in AVID were in patients categorized as likely to benefit, all 42 of these patients had EF values \textless or =0.35. Neither advanced age nor poorer functional class predicted ICD efficacy in AVID. CONCLUSION: Of the 3 characteristics identified to predict ICD efficacy in CIDS, only depressed EF predicted ICD efficacy in AVID. Thus physicians faced with limited resources might elect to consider ICD therapy over antiarrhythmic drug use in patients with severely depressed EF values.",2001.0,,7LUVZN6W,0,behavior,547
547,Epidemiology and management of alcohol misuse comorbid with other disorders.,"Keyes, Katherine M.; Hasin, Deborah S.","This chapter reviews the patterns of and risk factors for alcohol disorder comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders, and discuss evidence-based practices for the treatment of alcohol disorders and co-occurring illnesses in adolescence.Psychiatric disorders comorbid with substance disorders in adolescence are common, and predict greater adverse outcomes compared to adolescents without comorbid conditions. While safe and effective treatments for adolescent substance use disorders are available, treatment uptake is limited and affected by a number of factors such as socioeconomic position of the parents, access, and availability. Evidence-based treatments for substance disorders include motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral therapy, and contingency management. Among adolescents, family therapy, 12-step programs, and therapeutic communities have also been shown to be efficacious. Conduct disorder is the most prevalent psychiatric disorder comorbid with substance disorders in adolescence; multisystematic therapy was developed for adolescents confronting comorbid conduct and substance use disorders. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is commonly seen In adolescents with substance use disorders. Available evidence suggests that minimal improvement in ADHD is seen in adolescents with an active substance disorder; thus, substance disorders should be treated before a rigorous protocol of treatment for ADHD is initiated. Mood disorders, including depressive and bipolar disorders, are prevalent among adolescents with a substance use disorder, especially females. A dearth of evidence is available on treatments for comorbid mood and substance use disorders in adolescents.

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has strong evidence among general populations but has not been studied among at-risk pregnant women to prevent depression. We examined the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical outcomes of depression symptom severity and relapse/recurrence associated with MBCT adapted for perinatal women (MBCT-PD). Pregnant women with depression histories were recruited from obstetrics clinics in a large health maintenance organization at two sites and enrolled in MBCT-PD (N = 49). Self-reported depressive symptoms and interview-based assessments of depression relapse/recurrence status were measured at baseline, during MBCT-PD, and through 6-months postpartum. Pregnant women reported interest, engagement, and satisfaction with the program. Retention rates were high, as were rates of completion of daily homework practices. Intent to treat analyses indicated a significant improvement in depression symptom levels and an 18 \% rate of relapse/recurrence through 6 months postpartum. MBCT-PD shows promise as an acceptable, feasible, and clinically beneficial brief psychosocial prevention option for pregnant women with histories of depression. Randomized controlled trials are needed to examine the efficacy of MBCT-PD for the prevention of depressive relapse/recurrence during pregnancy and postpartum.",2015.0,10.1007/s00737-014-0468-x,A3BZIFKZ,0,cognitive,549
549,The mediating role of dysfunctional coping in the relationship between beliefs about the disease and the level of depression in patients with rheumatoid arthritis,"Ziarko, M.; Mojs, E.; Piasecki, B.; Samborski, W.","Aim. Rheumatoid arthritis is one of the most severe chronic diseases. In many cases it leads to disability and results in a decreased quality of life and increased levels of anxiety and depression. The problem that needs to be addressed is the following: which mental processes lead to increased levels of depression in patients with rheumatoid arthritis? Methods. 210 patients with rheumatoid arthritis hospitalized in rheumatology wards took part in the research. They filled in illness perception questionnaires (IPQ-R) and questionnaires for testing strategies of handling stress (Mini-COPE) and the level of depression (CES-D). Results. The observed correlation coefficients indicate that several elements of the perception of one's disease moderately contribute to a high level of depression. Moreover, frequent use of dysfunctional coping strategies contributed to high levels of depression. Dysfunctional coping was moderately linked to depression. Conclusion. The conducted analyses confirmed the links between the beliefs about the disease and levels of depression and showed that the use of dysfunctional coping strategies mediates the relationship between the following elements of the representation of the disease: illness coherence, emotional representation, psychological attribution, risk factors, and the level of depression. \textcopyright 2014 Michal Ziarko et al.",2014.0,10.1155/2014/585063,M84UPQNI,0,diathesis,550
550,Efficacy and safety of perampanel in patients with neurologic and psychiatric comorbidities: Post-HOC analysis of phase III epilepsy trials.,"D, Squillacote; H, Yang; B, Williams; S, Zhou; A, Laurenza; V, Biton","Rationale: Perampanel (PER), a selective, noncompetitive AMPA antagonist, has been approved as adjunctive treatment for partialonset seizures (POS). Certain neurologic and psychiatric comorbidities are reported more often in individuals with epilepsy than in those without epilepsy, as expected for this disease. Here we present the efficacy and safety of PER in patients with these common comorbidities from a post-hoc analysis of pooled phase III studies. Methods: Patients with pharmacoresistant POS enrolled in the phase III trials were aged \textgreater 12 years and receiving 1-3 concomitant AEDs as background therapy. Following 6-week baseline, patients were randomized to once-daily double-blind (DB) treatment (6-week titration, 13-week maintenance) with placebo or PER 8 or 12mg (studies 304 and 305); or with placebo or PER 2, 4, or 8mg (study 306). Study results were pooled and patients with preexisting neurological and psychiatric comorbidities (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [Med DRA] preferred terms detailed in Tables) at baseline were grouped (with possible overlap). The efficacy population excluded patients from Latin American sites (N=160 patients) due to a significant treatment-by-region interaction. Efficacy was also limited to the completer population for the neurologic (N=264) and psychiatric (N=185) comorbidities groups. Efficacy endpoints were median percent change from baseline in seizure frequency/28 days and responder rate by actual (last) dose. The full safety population was included for the neurologic (N=372) and psychiatric (N=265) comorbidities groups, and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported. Results: PER treatment in patients with neurologic and psychiatric comorbidities was efficacious compared to placebo, albeit slightly less so when compared to the overall population (Table 1). A limitation of comparing PER efficacy and safety with the overall population is the smaller number of patients in some of the comorbid dose groups. However, when the comorbidity dose group numbers are relatively high, they approximate the overall population. As expected in patients with neurologic and psychiatric comorbidities, any TEAEs, as well as dizziness, somnolence, and fatigue (three central nervous system-related TEAEs), were greater in this group compared to the overall population (Table 2). Conclusions: In these trials, PER was effective in pharmacoresistant POS patients with commonly occurring neurologic and psychiatric comorbidities. In patients with either comorbidity type, PER demonstrated efficacy, generally mirroring the overall population, with responder rates more close than median percent changes from baseline in seizure frequency/28 days. In patients reporting these comorbidities prior to the trials, there was higher risk of TEAEs in nearly all dose groups including placebo, possibly reflecting a more severely affected subgroup of POS patients.

551,Psychosocial and psychodynamic factors influencing health care utilisation.,"Maier, Thomas","This paper aims to elucidate some dysfunctional aspects of health care utilisation by combining concepts from modern systems theory and from psychoanalysis. Contemporary health care in industrialised countries can be conceived as a social system in terms of modern systems theory. According to this theory, social systems are operating on the basis of a 'guiding difference,' which in the case of health care is the distinction between 'healthy' and 'ill.' Its rigidity in adhering to the healthy-ill dichotomy exposes health care to being collusively entangled in the interpersonal defence arrangements of patients. In the psychoanalytic view, individual conflicts can be warded off from consciousness not only by intrapsychic defence, but also by interpersonal defence mechanisms. These mechanisms involve the patients' close social environment, often including doctors and hospitals. The functioning and the motivational structure of health care itself shows features of neurotic defence: not only its representatives, but health care as a whole act in a rigid, obsessive manner in order to separate the healthy from the ill and to battle against (presumed) diseases. This obsession sometimes results in excessive diagnostic activism and in inconsiderate application of aggressive medical treatments. Both are inappropriate with regard to the salient problem of modern medicine: the increase of chronic nonfatal diseases like depression and chronic pain. The described defence mechanisms are unconscious not only to patients but also to health care professionals (let alone health politicians), and are contributing to dysfunctional health care overuse.",2006.0,10/cv7fgr,RZIUWY43,0,psychodynamic,552

The study addresses spatial organization of LTD within one side of the face. Methods: The blink reflex was evoked by electrical test stimulation in the supraorbital nerve area before and after conditioning LFS in 10 healthy volunteers. Noxious LFS (1 Hz) was applied to skin afferents of supraorbital (sLFS), infraorbital (iLFS), or mental (mLFS) nerves. All stimuli were applied to the same side of the face with intensities of three times pain threshold. Volunteers rated the test stimulus intensity. Each volunteer participated in four sessions with sLFS, iLFS, mLFS, or without LFS (control). Results: Pain ratings of electrical test stimulation were differently affected in experimental sessions (p \textless 0.01) with strongest reduction by -19.6 \% after sLFS. The reflex integral decreased by -34.7 \% significantly stronger after sLFS than in all other experimental conditions (p \textless 0.001). Electrical pain thresholds increased significantly stronger in sLFS than in iLFS, mLFS, and control (p \textless 0.001). Conclusions: Trigeminal nociception and pain were inhibited by homotopic LFS at the forehead but not after heterotopic LFS of infraorbital and mental nerve skin afferents. Significance: Homotopic organization of ipsilateral trigeminal LTD in man may have implications for future neuromodulatory treatment of chronic craniofacial pain.

We prospectively studied the rates, course, and longitudinal prediction of NSSI from early through middle adolescence with a community sample of 103 youth (ages 11-14) who were assessed for NSSI at baseline and 2 1/2 years later (94 \% retention; final N = 97). Multiple risk factors (temperament, cognitive and interpersonal vulnerabilities, stressors; youths' and mothers' depression) were examined as prospective predictors of NSSI over the 21/2 year follow-up. Analyses showed that 18 \% of youth engaged in NSSI over the 21/2-year follow-up; 14 \% for the first time. Distal risks (assessed at baseline) that differentiated youth who engaged in NSSI from those who did not included negative cognitive style and mothers' prior depression. Proximal factors (assessed 2 years after baseline) that differentiated NSSI from non-NSSI youth included stressors, depressive symptoms, poor relationship quality, excessive reassurance seeking, and mothers' onset of depression. Several of these factors predicted new engagement of NSSI over 21/2 years. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",,,UGY7U53A,0,psychodynamic,554

AIMS: To identify factors associated with symptomatic outcome, response, and drop-out in depressive patients under naturalistic CBT. METHOD: 193 patients with major depression or dysthymia were tested. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were entered as predictors in hierarchical regression analyses. RESULTS: A higher degree of pretreatment depression, early improvement, and completion of therapy were identified as predictors for symptomatic change and response. Drop-out was predicted by concurrent personality disorder, less positive outcome expectancies, and by failure to improve early in treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the importance of early response to predict improvement in routine CBT. Attempts to refine the quality of treatment programs should focus on avoiding premature termination (drop-out) and consider motivational factors in more depth. Routinely administered standardized assessments would enhance symptom monitoring and help to identify persons at risk of not improving under therapy.",2013.0,10.1017/S1352465812001063,4SLD4HPV,0,personality,555

Participants included 30 men and 118 women recruited between December 1, 2013 and March 31, 2014. Data on socio-demographics, health status, screening intentions and emotional barriers to bowel screening were collected via an on-line survey. Logistic regression analysis was utilised to investigate predictors of screening intention. Individuals were more likely to report intention to screen if they had prior screening experience, and reported fewer emotional concerns to screening for CRC. Results implicate disgust as a predictor of screening avoidance among participants. Specifically, higher reported faecal disgust was predictive of a 3% decrease in screening intention. This study was the first to empirically position disgust alongside other negative emotional states as an affective barrier to screening for CRC. Trait disgust sensitivity was not a reliable predictor of screening intention.

S.","IMPORTANCE: Caregiver burden may result from providing care for patients with chronic illness. It can occur in any of the 43.5 million individuals providing support to midlife and older adults. Caregiver burden is frequently overlooked by clinicians. OBJECTIVES: To outline the epidemiology of caregiver burden; to provide strategies to diagnose, assess, and intervene for caregiver burden in clinical practice; and to evaluate evidence on interventions intended to avert or mitigate caregiver burden and related caregiver distress. EVIDENCE: Cohort studies examining the relation between demographic and social risk factors and adverse outcomes of caregiver burden were reviewed. Review of recent meta-analyses to summarize the effectiveness of caregiver burden interventions were identified by searching Ovid MEDLINE, AgeLine, and the Cochrane Library. RESULTS: Risk factors for caregiver burden include female sex, low educational attainment, residence with the care recipient, higher number of hours spent caregiving, depression, social isolation, financial stress, and lack of choice in being a caregiver. Practical assessment strategies for caregiver burden exist to evaluate caregivers, their care recipients, and the care recipient's overall caregiving needs. A variety of psychosocial and pharmacological interventions have shown mild to modest efficacy in mitigating caregiver burden and associated manifestations of caregiver distress in high-qualitymeta-analyses. Psychosocial interventions include support groups or psychoeducational interventions for caregivers of dementia patients (effect size, 0.09-0.23). Pharmacologic interventions include use of anticholinergics or antipsychotic medications for dementia or dementia-related behaviors in the care recipient (effect size, 0.18-0.27). Many studies showed improvements in caregiver burden-associated symptoms (eg, mood, coping, self-efficacy) even when caregiver burden itselfwas minimally improved. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Physicians have a responsibility to recognize caregiver burden.

RESULTS: More social support on the Significant Others Scale significantly predicted better outcome on the CAPS, even after controlling for the effects of treatment group and of pretreatment severity. Importantly, social support was only a significant predictor of outcome for participants receiving cognitive restructuring and (or) exposure therapy and not for participants in the relaxation condition.

Method: A total of 24 detained children (aged 3 months to 17 years) were assessed with their parents or carer after being referred by a registered legal charity. Thirteen were seen by a pediatrician alone, 4 by a psychologist alone, and 7 by both professions using semi-structured clinical interviews. The psychologist also used standardized self-report questionnaires to measure psychopathology. Results: During the psychological assessment of 11 children, 8 met criteria for psychiatric caseness on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. All 11 reported symptoms of depression and anxiety. Sleep problems, somatic complaints, poor appetite, emotional symptoms, and behavioral difficulties were common. Symptoms of global distress were also reported by all 9 parents. According to pediatric assessment 8 out of 20 children had lost weight. Six had missed health appointments and 2 were taken to hospital. Nutritional, developmental, educational, and child protection concerns were raised. Conclusions: Detained children were found to be experiencing mental and physical health difficulties of recent onset, which appeared to be related to the detention experience. These findings support previous Australian studies demonstrating that detention is not in the best interest of the child. It suggests that current UK policies regarding the detention of children for purposes of immigration control should be re-examined. Further research in the area is required. Practice implications: Although high levels of mental and physical health problems, as well as child protection concerns were detected, detained families had very limited access to appropriate assessment, support or treatment. The traumatic experience of detention itself also has implications for the sizeable proportion of psychologically distressed children who are eventually released from detention and expected to successfully reintegrate into British society; while those children who are deported are returned with increased vulnerability to future stressors. \textcopyright 2009.",2009.0,10.1016/j.chiabu.2008.10.005,YNB7JSQU,0,diathesis,561
561,The origins of Waugh's victim as hero.,"Kloss, Robert J.","Discusses works by E. Waugh in terms of the basis for his religious theme of the triumph of grace over human folly and the paradox that human failures may in reality be divine victories-a paradox of victim as hero. Waugh suffered life-long insomnia, unrelenting depression, hallucinations, tendencies toward cruelty, and homosexuality; these conditions were not recognized in his time, but presently would be seen as part of a larger pattern of paranoia. Evidence of the foregoing symptoms is plentiful throughout Waugh's life and works. The psychodynamics of his relationships with family, his personality, and his religious and sexual orientations are discussed.

562,Schizophrenia.,"Turkington, D.; Martindale, B.; Bloch-Thorsen, G. R.","Schizophrenia is a major cause of disability worldwide with a roughly stable prevalence of approximately 1 \% . The outcome in Western society has generally been viewed as being poor with a tendency to regular relapse or chronicity in the majority. There would appear to be no convincing evidence as yet of any explanatory underlying disease process. It would seem most likely that schizophrenia represents the syndromal manifestation of a variety of diverse accumulated insults to psychological functioning. These would include combinations of the following stressors: genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological. The different combinations of these elements in each individual formulation will contribute to the form and content of the actual psychotic symptoms displayed. This chapter will attempt to outline how the different main psychological treatment modalities (psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral, and family) conceptualize and work with these diverse presentations of positive, negative, and linked affective symptoms. Process of therapy along with models of therapy effect will be described. Possible pitfalls will be outlined with strategies to overcome these. The evidence base supportive of each intervention will be stated. The chapter will end with a discussion of future research and training directions in relation to implementation.

564,MOSAIC (MOthers' Advocates In the Community): protocol and sample description of a cluster randomised trial of mentor mother support to reduce intimate partner violence among pregnant or recent mothers.,"Aj, Taft; R, Small; Kl, Hegarty; J, Lumley; Lf, Watson; L, Gold","BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is prevalent globally, experienced by a significant minority of women in the early childbearing years and is harmful to the mental and physical health of women and children. There are very few studies with rigorous designs which have tested the effectiveness of IPV interventions to improve the health and wellbeing of abused women. Evidence for the separate benefit to victims of social support, advocacy and non-professional mentoring suggested that a combined model may reduce the levels of violence, the associated mental health damage and may increase a woman's health, safety and connection with her children. This paper describes the development, design and implementation of a trial of mentor mother support set in primary care, including baseline characteristics of participating women. METHODS/DESIGN: MOSAIC (MOtherS' Advocates In the Community) was a cluster randomised trial embedded in general practice and maternal and child health (MCH) nursing services in disadvantaged suburbs of Melbourne, Australia. Women who were pregnant or with infants, identified as abused or symptomatic of abuse, were referred by IPV-trained GPs and MCH nurses from 24 general practices and eight nurse teams from January 2006 to December 2007. Women in the intervention arm received up to 12 months support from trained and supported non-professional mentor mothers. Vietnamese health professionals also referred Vietnamese women to bilingual mentors in a sub-study. Baseline and follow-up surveys at 12 months measured IPV (CAS), depression (EPDS), general health (SF-36), social support (MOS-SF) and attachment to children (PSI-SF). Significant development and piloting occurred prior to trial commencement. Implementation interviews with MCH nurses, GPs and mentors assisted further refinement of the intervention. In-depth interviews with participants and mentors, and follow-up surveys of MCH nurses and GPs at trial conclusion will shed further light on MOSAIC's impact. DISCUSSION: Despite significant challenges, MOSAIC will make an important contribution to the need for evidence of effective partner violence interventions, the role of non-professional mentors in partner violence support services and the need for more evaluation of effective health professional training and support in caring for abused women and children among their populations.

565,Predictors and moderators of between-therapists and within-therapist differences in depressed outpatients' experiences of the Rogerian conditions.,"Zuroff, David C.; Shahar, Golan; Blatt, Sidney J.; Kelly, Allison C.; Leybman, Michelle J.","The extent to which patients experience their therapists as providing empathy, positive regard and genuineness (the Rogerian Conditions) is an important predictor of outcome in the psychotherapy of depression (Zuroff \& Blatt, 2006). Using data from 157 depressed outpatients treated by 27 therapists in the cognitive-behavior therapy, interpersonal therapy, or clinical management with placebo conditions of the Treatment of Depression Collaborative Research Program (Elkin et al., 1989), Zuroff, Kelly, Leybman, Blatt, and Wampold (2010) showed that between-therapists and within-therapist differences in Rogerian Conditions at the second treatment session predicted more rapid reductions in overall maladjustment. We conducted novel analyses intended to identify: 1) predictors of between-therapists and within-therapist differences in Rogerian Conditions and 2) moderators of the effects on maladjustment of between-therapists and within-therapist differences in Rogerian Conditions. Patients with lower levels of self-critical perfectionism, higher levels of an adaptive form of dependency or higher expectations of warmth from their therapists experienced higher levels of Rogerian Conditions than their therapist's average patient. High baseline self-critical perfectionism diminished the between-therapists effect of Rogerian Conditions on maladjustment, whereas baseline adaptive dependency enhanced the within-therapist effect of Rogerian Conditions. Results shed additional light on the centrality of patient characteristics, the Rogerian Conditions, and their transactions and interactions on outcome in brief outpatient therapy for depression.

566,Immune function and psychological distress in familial dementia caregivers: A controlled trial of a cognitive-behavioral intervention.,"Lancer, Kevin Matthew","Recent data on the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease estimate that sufferers could number as high as 4.78 million; that number is expected to quadruple by the year 2050. The vast majority of persons with dementia reside in the community, able to do so because of the care received from their families. The increase in the number of the elderly dependent on others for assistance will continue to increase, straining already limited individual and societal resources. The subjects of this study were Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) familial caregivers, representing a portion of society needing assistance and that is growing both in sheer numbers and overall percentage of the population. Caregivers dealing with the symptoms of a gradual, progressive, irreversible neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's face numerous emotional, psychological, social, and financial demands that classify ADRD caregiving as a chronic stressor. In addition, familial caregivers are often elderly themselves, and are at an increased risk for injury, illness, and they face an exacerbation of already declining immune system function due to chronic stress. This study was an attempt to enhance immune system functioning and reduce subjective stress levels in the familial caregivers of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) patients. In order to accomplish that objective, a controlled comparison between a cognitively based stress management intervention (CBSM) and a no-treatment control group was conducted. This study also attempted to make a contribution to the existing body of knowledge in the field of psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) by addressing the complicated inter-relationship between psychological stress and immune system functioning. To that end, study participants were tested with several measures of psychological performance, such as the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D), the Ways of Coping-Revised (WOCR), Profile of Mood States (POMS), and the Personal Views Survey III-Revised (PVS-III-R), as well as one measure of immune system function, plasma levels of interleukin-6.

567,Alexithymia and gastrointestinal-specific anxiety in moderate to severe irritable bowel syndrome.,"Porcelli, Piero and","OBJECTIVE: Gastrointestinal-specific anxiety (GSA) and alexithymia are two psychological constructs that may contribute to severity of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We aimed to investigate their independent contribution in predicting the level of severity in a group of patients with moderate to severe IBS. METHOD: A sample of 177 consecutive IBS patients (49.2 \% with moderate and 50.8 \% with severe IBS), diagnosed with Rome III criteria, were evaluated for IBS symptoms, alexithymia, GSA, psychological distress, and psychosocial functioning with validated scales. RESULTS: IBS severity was highly associated to both alexithymia (r=0.61) and GSA (r=0.66), that were also associated to each other (r=0.64). Severe IBS patients scored significantly different than moderate IBS patients to all scales in the expected direction. Multiple and hierarchical regression analyses showed that IBS severity was predicted at a similar degree by alexithymia and GSA, controlled for IBS symptoms, psychological distress, and psychosocial functioning. Effect sizes showed that the highest IBS severity scores were obtained by patients with high alexithymia alone (d=1.16) or combined with higher GSA (d=1.45). CONCLUSION: Alexithymia and GSA were closely related to each other and associated to IBS severity, thus suggesting a common basis of emotional dysregulation. However, alexithymia (particularly the facets of difficulty identifying and describing feelings) resulted to be a stronger predictor of IBS severity than GSA, thus suggesting that impaired affective awareness may reflect on the clinical manifestations of IBS.",2014.0,10.1016/j.comppsych.2014.05.022,RKFCB9LR,0,cognitive_additional,568

According to this theory, implicit and explicit cognitive processes have differential effects on depressive reactions to stressful life events. Implicit processes are hypothesized to be critical in determining an individual's immediate affective reaction to stress whereas explicit cognitions are thought to be more involved in long-term depressive reactions. Consistent with hypotheses, the results of study 1 (cross-sectional; N=237) showed that implicit, but not explicit, cognitions predicted immediate affective reactions to a lab stressor. Study 2 (longitudinal; N=251) also supported the dual-process model of cognitive vulnerability to depression. Results showed that both the implicit and explicit measures interacted with life stress to predict prospective changes in depressive symptoms, respectively. However, when both implicit and explicit predictors were entered into a regression equation simultaneously, only the explicit measure interacted with stress to remain a unique predictor of depressive symptoms over the five-week prospective interval.",2007.0,10.1016/j.brat.2006.09.003,2DR9NQQN,0,cognitive,569

For example, parental depression and cognitive vulnerability are known markers of depression risk, but no study has examined their interactive effects on children's cortisol reactivity, a likely mediator of early depression risk. We examined relations across these different levels of vulnerability using cross-sectional and longitudinal methods in two community samples of children. Children were assessed for cognitive vulnerability using self-reports (Study 1; n = 244) and tasks tapping memory and attentional bias (Study 2; n = 205), and their parents were assessed for depression history using structured clinical interviews. In both samples, children participated in standardized stress tasks and cortisol reactivity was assessed. Cross-sectionally and longitudinally, parental depression history and child cognitive vulnerability interacted to predict children's cortisol reactivity; associations between parent depression and elevated child cortisol activity were found when children also showed elevated depressotypic attributions as well as attentional and memory biases. Findings indicate that models of children's emerging depression risk may benefit from the examination of the interactive effects of multiple sources of vulnerability across levels of analysis.",2014.0,10.1017/S0954579414001138,Z8YRM7YB,0,cognitive,570
570,Assessment of impulsivity with self-report scales and behavioral tasks in symptomatic and remitted patients with major depression,"Ogüt, C.; Basar, K.","Objective: Impulsivity is a multidimentional construct involving diverse neuropsychological and neurobiological processes. Impulsivity has clinical significance in mood disorders due to its potential association with suicidality [1] and treatment non compliance [2]. Research on impulsivity in mood disorders frequently involves bipolar patients [3], with relatively few and nonconsistent studies on unipolar depression [4]. The aim was to cross-sectionally assess impulsivity simultaneously with self-report scales and behavioral tasks in patients with depression and study their association with suicidality. Method: Consecutive patients clinically diagnosed with major depression in psychiatry outpatient clinic were invited to participate. Hundred and three outpatients diagnosed with lifetime and current major depression with Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV were recruited. Comorbidity of any current Axis I mental disorder other than remitted anxiety disorders was the criteria for exclusion. “Remitted Major Depression” (RMD, n = 32) and “Major Depression” (MD, n = 71) groups were constituted based on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores < 7 and > 8, respectively. Control group (n = 30) consisted of individuals with no lifetime or current diagnoses. Suicidal ideation and behaviour history was assessed with a standard questionnaire. Impulsivity was evaluated with self-report scales: Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11), UPPS Impulsive Behaviour Scale (UPPS); as well as computerized behavioral tasks: Go/No-Go Task (GNG), Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART). Data were analyzed with SPSS Statistics 17.0 with Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, Spearman tests where appropriate. Significance level was set as p < 0.05. Results: Self-report scales' scores revealed significant differ ences between groups. MD scored higher in UPPS urgency subscale, compared to both RMD (P = 0.003) and controls (P < 0.001). BIS-11 non-planning subscale scores in MD were higher than controls (P = 0.016). However, there was no significant difference between groups in behavioral task performance. When data from all participants were pooled, depression symptom severity was found to have significant positive correlations with lack of premeditation and urgency subscales of UPPS, non-planning and attentional impulsivity subscales of BIS-11, and ommision errors in GNG. MD patients reporting suicidal ideation within last month had higher BIS-11 total and attentional impulsivity scores, UPPS total, lack of premeditation and urgency scores, and more frequent commission errors in GNG reflecting failure in response inhibition (p < 0.05). Furthermore, MD patients with lifetime history of suicide attempt had higher scores for BIS-11 total, motor, and non-planning impulsivity scores (p < 0.05), however there was no difference in behavioral task performances. Conclusion: Higher self-reported impulsivity during depres sive episode suggests a state, rather than trait, impulsivity associated with major depression. However, task performance which is not different from control while depressed or in remission does not support this hypothesis. Prospective studies involving tasks assessing other impulsivity features are required. However, our findings suggest an association between both suicidal ideation and behavior and response inhibition and urgency facets of impulsivity. The relationship between impulsivity and suicidality in depressed patients should be investigated in further studies in order to be able to predict the risk of suicide, improve management according to this risk, and to develop more effective treatment approaches.",2017.0,,U36UN48A,0,additional,571

B.; Spinhoven, P.; Hoffman, T.; Jonker, K.; Hoencamp, E.; Haffmans, P. M.; Dyck, R.","The purposes of this monograph are to describe the postcranial skeletons of the earliest known mammals, and to probe, in so far as possible by osteological study, biological questions concerning the habits and adaptations of these late Triassic forms. In this context, information on the background of this investigation is useful. Studies of Mesozoic mammals, begun some 150 years ago, are based on rare and fragmentary fossils, principally jaws and teeth. These investigations have yielded a bare outline of some 120 million years of mammalian evolution-about two-thirds of mammalian history. No assessment of the important biological changes occurring during this time can ever be complete, but major advances are possible as new discoveries provide material that is more complete or that represents a previously unknown evolutionary stage. So tenuous is the evidence that at least some concepts are re-evaluated with each discovery. Postcranial anatomy offers especially intriguing prospects for investigation because associated material (that can be positively assigned to a taxon below subclass) has been for the most part unknown, and indeed even dissociated bones are a rarity. Since G.G. Simpson's monographs of 1928 and 1929, progress in the study of Mesozoic mammals has been largely dependent on new finds. A major impetus to renewed investigation came from the discoveries of Mesozoic mammals by Walter Kuhne in 1939 and during the immediate post-war years. Kuhne first worked on fissures in the Carboniferous limestone quarries at Frome, Somerset, in southwest England where he collected a series of teeth of the problematical form Haramiya and two triconodont teeth which were placed in the genus Eozostrodon (Parrington 1941, 1946). The fissure faunas are generally thought to be of Upper Triassic (Rhaetic) age (Kuhne 1946), although Kermack, Musset & Rigney (1973) believe that the evidence is insufficient to determine whether the deposits are Rhaetic or Lower Liassic. After the war Kuhne carried his explorations farther west, eventually reaching the quarries at Bridgend in Glamorgan, Wales, where he not only found more triconodont teeth in some quantity (Kuhne 1958) but also a symmetrodont tooth (Kuhne 1950). Shortly after making these discoveries, Kuhne returned to Germany and the work was continued by a team from University College, London, under the leadership of Dr K.A.

In our commentary we address this statement and ask whether this example introduces a vicarious or an empathic form of embarrassment. We elaborate commonalities and differences between these two forms of emotional experiences and discuss their underlying mechanisms. We suggest that both, vicarious and empathic emotions, originate from the simulation processes mirroring and mentalizing that depend on anchoring and adjustment. We claim the term empathic emotion to be reserved exclusively for incidents where perceivers and social targets have shared affective experience, whereas vicarious emotion offers a wider scope and also includes non-shared affective experiences. Both are supposed to be highly functional in social interactions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",2013.0,,Z6EWLWQW,0,psychodynamic,574
574,Depression and reduced heart rate variability after cardiac surgery: the mediating role of emotion regulation.,"Patron, Elisabetta and","BACKGROUND: Heart rate variability (HRV), as an index of autonomic nervous system (ANS) functioning, is reduced by depression after cardiac surgery, but the underlying mechanisms of this relationship are poorly understood. Poor emotion regulation as a core symptom of depression has also been associated with altered ANS functioning. The present study aimed to examine whether emotion dysregulation could be a mediator of the depression-reduced HRV relationship observed after cardiac surgery. METHODS: Self-reported emotion regulation and four-minute HRV were measured in 25 depressed and 43 nondepressed patients after cardiac surgery. Mediation analysis was conducted to evaluate emotion regulation as a mediator of the depression-reduced HRV relationship. RESULTS: Compared to nondepressed patients, those with depression showed lower standard deviation of normal-to-normal (NN) intervals (p \textless .05), root mean square successive difference of NN intervals (p \textless .004), and number of interval differences of successive NN intervals greater than 50ms (NN50) (p \textless .05). Increased low frequency (LF) in normalized units (n.u.) and reduced high frequency (HF) n.u. were also found in depressed compared to nondepressed patients (p's \textless .01). Mediation analysis revealed that suppression of emotion-expressive behavior partially mediated the effect of depression on LF n.u. and HF n.u. CONCLUSIONS: Results confirmed previous findings showing that depression is associated with reduced HRV, especially a reduced vagal tone and a sympathovagal imbalance, after cardiac surgery. This study also provides preliminary evidence that increased trait levels of suppression of emotion-expressive behavior may mediate the depression-related sympathovagal imbalance after cardiac surgery.",2014.0,10.1016/j.autneu.2013.11.004,L68WF4K3,0,cognitive,575

The author discusses clinical themes that occur during treatment, and addresses the issues of countertransference, transference, and enactments at various stages of the therapeutic process. These themes are the unconscious message you can't help me'; the self-defeating I dread what you think of me'; and a feeling of a lack of confidence expressed as I can't be helped because I'm useless.' These themes are interpreted as reflecting Oedipal dilemmas in developing young men, who are often bound to their defenses such that little change appears to occur during the course of therapy. The author suggests that it is essential to persevere when working with such young people, who should be thought of as seeking a way out of the futility they are feeling.

F.","Specific psychotherapies for childhood or adolescent depression have been tested against control or comparative conditions. In school-age children with elevated depressive symptoms, cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) administered in school settings have proven superior to no treatment or to waiting-list controls in almost all studies. One child study suggests that CBT is superior to alternative psychosocial intervention during acute treatment but not at longer term follow-up. No one type of CBT for children has proven more efficacious than others. Studies with adolescents have included subjects with diagnosed depressive disorders, primarily major depression. Seven of nine efficacy studies indicate that CBT is more efficacious than a waiting-list condition or than a non-CBT alternative psychotherapy at the end of acute intervention. Longer term follow-up indicates high rates of remission or recovery among depressed adolescents and no superiority of CBT over other psychotherapies in this regard; however, CBT is associated with more rapid remission of symptoms than is family or supportive therapy. Interpersonal psychotherapy has been demonstrated to be more efficacious than a waiting-list condition or minimal contact clinical management in two acute treatment studies.

577,"Differential predictors of the long-term levels of pain intensity, work disability, healthcare use, and medication use in a sample of workers' compensation claimants.","Wideman, Timothy H.; Sullivan, Michael J. L.","The fear avoidance model of pain (FAM) conceptualizes pain catastrophizing as the cognitive antecedent of pain-related fear, and pain-related fear as the emotional antecedent of depression and disability. The FAM is essentially one of mediation whereby pain-related fear becomes the process by which depression or disability ensue. However, emerging literature suggests that pain catastrophizing, pain-related fear, and depression might be at least partially distinct in their prediction of different pain-related outcomes. The primary purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether psychological factors in the FAM (pain catastrophizing, pain-related fear, and depression) differentially predict long-term pain-related outcomes. Toward this objective, we conducted a prospective study using a cohort of 202 individuals with subacute work-related musculoskeletal injuries. Participants completed a 7-week physical therapy program with a functional rehabilitation orientation. Posttreatment measures of fear of movement, pain catastrophizing, depression, and pain self-efficacy were used to predict the persistence of pain symptoms, healthcare use, medication use, and return-to-work at one-year follow-up. Results from hierarchical linear and logistic regression analyses revealed that pain catastrophizing and fear of movement act as differential predictors of long-term pain-related outcomes. Specifically, we found unique relationships between pain catastrophizing and long-term pain intensity, and fear of movement and long-term work disability. After controlling for pain intensity and FAM variables, pain self-efficacy was shown to be a unique predictor of medication use. Implications for the FAM and the clinical management of musculoskeletal pain conditions are discussed. Unique relationships were found between pain catastrophizing and long-term pain intensity, between fear of movement and long-term work disability, and between pain self-efficacy and medication use at one-year follow-up.",2011.0,10.1016/j.pain.2010.10.044,HYP9Q3RN,0,behavior,578

Results Forty-nine percent of patients reported elevated anxiety; 41 \% were depressed; and 51 \% had high global distress. Health-related stigma was significantly related to global psychological distress and quality of life with greater stigma and shame related to poorer outcomes. These effects were mediated by illness appraisals and social constraints. Conclusions Health-related stigma appears to contribute to poorer adjustment by constraining interpersonal discussions about cancer and heightening feelings of threat.

Dissociative seizures markedly impair quality of life. Their close superficial resemblance to epileptic seizures makes them hard to diagnose. METHODS: Selective literature search in PubMed and PsycINFO. RESULTS: Persons with dissociative seizures constitute a mixed group with a wide variety of predisposing, precipitating, and maintaining factors. Some 90 \% have comorbid psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, somatoform disorders, personality disorders, or post-traumatic stress disorder. Video-EEG monitoring enables highly reliable diagnosis. Psychotherapy is considered the treatment of first choice; in prospective studies, it has been found to lower the frequency of dissociative seizures by at least 50 \% , or to eliminate them completely, in 50 \% to 80 \% of patients. An individually tailored combination of behavioral therapeutic, imagery-based, and psychodynamic approaches seems reasonable. For the treatment of psychiatric comorbidities, psychotherapy is indicated, in combination with psychoactive drugs if necessary. Before any treatment is provided, the diagnosis should be communicated to the patient in an appropriate way, ideally by both the neurologist and the psychotherapist, so that the patient can develop an alternative disease model. CONCLUSION: When the diagnosis of dissociative seizures has been made, psychotherapy is indicated, possibly in combination with psychoactive medication, in the setting of long-term treatment provided in collaboration by the neurologist, psychiatrist, psychotherapist, and family physician. Further randomized trials are needed to determine which treatments are best for which subgroups of patients.",2013.0,10.3238/arztebl.2013.0263,2CXVB7ZR,0,psychodynamic,581

Consequently, this systematic review and meta-analysis explores the correlates of variables within these four broad areas and PTG. From a total of 744 published studies addressing PTG in people with ABI, eight studies met inclusion criteria for detailed examination. Meta-analysis of these studies indicated that growth was related to employment, longer education, subjective beliefs about change post-injury, relationship status, older age, longer time since injury, and lower levels of depression. Results from homogeneity analyses indicated significant inter-study heterogeneity across variables. There is general support for the idea that people with ABI can experience growth, and that various demographics, injury-related variables, subjective beliefs and psychological health are related to growth. The contribution of social integration and the forming of new identities post-ABI to the experience of PTG is explored. These meta-analytic findings are however constrained by methodological limitations prevalent in the literature. Clinical and research implications are discussed with specific reference to community and collective factors that enable PTG.

582,A validation study of depressive syndromes in Parkinson's disease.,"Starkstein, Sergio E.; Merello, Marcelo; Jorge, Ricardo; Brockman, Simone; Bruce, David; Petracca, Gustavo; Robinson, Robert G.","The validity, sensitivity, and specificity of depressive symptoms for the diagnosis of major depression, minor depression, dysthymic disorder, and subsyndromal depression in Parkinson's disease (PD) were examined. A consecutive series of 173 patients with PD attending a Movement Disorders Clinic underwent a comprehensive psychiatric and neurological assessment. The symptoms of loss of interest/pleasure, changes in appetite or weight, changes in sleep, low energy, worthlessness or inappropriate guilt, psychomotor retardation/agitation, concentration deficits, and suicide ideation were all significantly associated with the presence of the DSM-IV depressed mood criterion for major depression. The symptoms of changes in appetite, changes in sleep, low energy, low self-esteem, poor concentration, and hopelessness were all significantly associated with the presence of the DSM-IV criterion of sad mood for dysthymic disorder. Thirty percent of our sample met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for major depression, 20 \% met diagnostic criteria for dysthymic disorder, 10 \% met diagnostic criteria for minor depression, and 8 \% met clinical criteria for subsyndromal depression. Patients with either major or minor depression had significantly more severe deficits in activities of daily living, more severe cognitive impairments, and more severe Parkinsonism than patients with either dysthymic disorder or no depression. This study provides validation to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for major depression and dysthymic disorder for use in PD. The categories of minor and subsyndromal depression may need further validation.",2008.0,10/fpvz4n,R4MLEX8V,0,psychodynamic,583
583,The role of personality variables and social support in distress and perceived health in patients following myocardial infarction,"Pedersen, S. S.; Middel, B.; Larsen, M. L.","Objectives: (1) To investigate whether patients with low versus high social support and satisfaction with support report less distress and health complaints following a first myocardial infarction (MI). (2) To examine whether personality traits mediate social support and its effect on distress and health complaints. Methods: A questionnaire was distributed to 112 consecutive patients with a first MI 4-6 weeks postinfarction. Objective clinical measures were obtained from the patients' medical records. Results: Patients with low social support were at increased risk of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Patients less satisfied with support were at increased risk of anxiety, depression, PTSD, and reported more health complaints. Generally, larger effect sizes were found for satisfaction with support compared with social support per se in relation to distress and health complaints. Neuroticism was identified as an independent predictor of all types of distress and health complaints when including both traits and social support variables in multivariable analyses, adjusted for demographic and clinical variables. Satisfaction with support only remained an independent predictor of depression. Conclusion: These results suggest that personality traits may mediate social support and its effect on distress and health complaints. Hence, it may be important to include personality variables when investigating social support in relation to distress and health. In clinical practice, screening for particular personality traits could identify patients at risk of distress and recurrent cardiac events. \textcopyright 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

584,Determinants of compliance with antiretroviral therapy in patients with human immunodeficiency virus: Prospective assessment with implications for enhancing compliance,"Singh, N.; Squier, C.; Sivek, C.; Wagener, M. and","Non-compliance with therapy is a significant problem, particularly when the disease process is chronic and therapeutic regimens are employed for prolonged periods. We assessed the prevalence and variables associated with compliance with antiretroviral therapy in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection, by means of a longitudinal observational study of 46 patients aged 23 to 68 years, with human immunodeficiency virus infection, followed at the Pittsburgh VA Medical Center. Data on demographics, medical status, physical functioning (Karnofsky performance scores), CD4 lymphocyte count, depression (Beck depression inventory), coping (inventory of coping with illness scale scores), and psychological and emotional stress (profile of mood states scale scores), were prospectively assessed on all patients at baseline and every 6 months. Compliance was assessed at 6 and 12 months: patients taking ≥ 80 \% of antiretroviral therapy were considered compliant. Overall, 63 \% of patients were compliant with antiretroviral therapy. Age, education, employment, religious support, and perceived quality of life did not correlate with compliance. By univariate analysis, lack of prior intravenous drug use was significantly associated with compliance (p = 0.01). Compliant patients had significantly better adaptive coping (p = 0.03), and less depression (p = 0.04). By multivariate analysis, black race was significantly associated with non-compliance independent of intravenous drug use and educational status. History of prior opportunistic infection (which presumably heightens the perceived severity of illness) (p = 0.02), and lesser psychological disturbance scores (p = 0.02) were associated with compliance. Compliance was observed despite the greater number of prescription medications taken by compliant patients (p = 0.04). At 12 months, Karnofsky scores were better in compliant patients (p = 0.02), although mortality was not different. Besides identifying predictors of compliance, our data suggest that symptoms of depression and psychological stress be sought in patients with non-adherence.",1996.0,10.1080/09540129650125696,HGXEZACW,0,diathesis,585
585,Loneliness predicts increased blood pressure: 5-year cross-lagged analyses in middle-aged and older adults.,"Hawkley, Louise C.; Thisted, Ronald A.; Masi, Christopher M.; Cacioppo, John T.","Loneliness is a prevalent social problem with serious physiological and health implications. However, much of the research to date is based on cross-sectional data, including our own earlier finding that loneliness was associated with elevated blood pressure (Hawkley, Masi, Berry \& Cacioppo, 2006). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the effect of loneliness accumulates to produce greater increases in systolic blood pressure (SBP) over a 4-year period than are observed in less lonely individuals. A population-based sample of 229 50- to 68-year-old White, Black, and Hispanic men and women in the Chicago Health, Aging, and Social Relations Study was tested annually for each of 5 consecutive years. Cross-lagged panel analyses revealed that loneliness at study onset predicted increases in SBP 2, 3, and 4 years later (B = 0.152, SE = 0.091, p \textless .05, one-tailed). These increases were cumulative such that higher initial levels of loneliness were associated with greater increases in SBP over a 4-year period. The effect of loneliness on SBP was independent of age, gender, race or ethnicity, cardiovascular risk factors, medications, health conditions, and the effects of depressive symptoms, social support, perceived stress, and hostility.

588,Therapy of the burnout syndrome.,"Korczak, Dieter; Wastian, Monika; Schneider, Michael","BACKGROUND: The prevalence, diagnostics and therapy of the burnout syndrome are increasingly discussed in the public. The unclear definition and diagnostics of the burnout syndrome are scientifically criticized. There are several therapies with unclear evidence for the treatment of burnout in existence. OBJECTIVES: The health technology assessment (HTA) report deals with the question of usage and efficacy of different burnout therapies. METHODS: For the years 2006 to 2011, a systematic literature research was done in 31 electronic databases (e.g. EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO). Important inclusion criteria are burnout, therapeutic intervention and treatment outcome. RESULTS: 17 studies meet the inclusion criteria and are regarded for the HTA report. The studies are very heterogeneous (sample size, type of intervention, measuring method, level of evidence). Due to their study design (e.g. four reviews, eight randomized controlled trials) the studies have a comparable high evidence: three times 1A, five times 1B, one time 2A, two times 2B and six times 4. 13 of the 17 studies are dealing with the efficacy of psychotherapy and psychosocial interventions for the reduction of burnout (partly in combination with other techniques). Cognitive behaviour therapy leads to the improvement of emotional exhaustion in the majority of the studies. The evidence is inconsistent for the efficacy of stress management and music therapy. Two studies regarding the efficacy of Qigong therapy do not deliver a distinct result. One study proves the efficacy of roots of Rhodiola rosea (evidence level 1B). Physical therapy is only in one study separately examined and does not show a better result than standard therapy. DISCUSSION: Despite the number of studies with high evidence the results for the efficacy of burnout therapies are preliminary and do have only limited reach. The authors of the studies complain about the low number of skilled studies for the therapy of burnout. Furthermore, they point to the insufficient evaluation of the therapy studies and the need for further research. Some authors report the effects of considerable natural recovering. Numerous limitations affect the quality of the results. Intervention contents and duration, study design and study size are very diverse and do not permit direct comparison. Most of the samples are small by size with low statistical power, long-term follow-ups are missing. Comorbidities and parallel utilized therapies are insufficient documented or controlled. Most of the studies use the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) as diagnostic or outcome-tool, but with different cut-off-points. It should be noticed that the validity of the MBI as diagnostic tool is not proved. Ethical, juridical and social determining factors are not covered or discussed in the studies. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of therapies for the treatment of the burnout syndrome is insufficient investigated. Only for cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) exists an adequate number of studies which prove its efficacy. Big long-term experimental studies are missing which compare the efficacy of the single therapies and evaluate their evidence. The natural recovering without any therapy needs further research. Additionally, it has to be examined to what extent therapies and their possible effects are thwarted by the conditions of the working place and the working conditions.",2012.0,10.3205/hta000103,WNJX5QAF,0,cognitive,589
589,A longitudinal examination of risk and protective factors associated with drug use and unsafe sex among young African American females.,"Voisin, Dexter R.; Hotton, Anna L.; Tan, Kevin; DiClemente, Ralph","This study prospectively examined associations among multiple theoretically informed risk (e.g., depression, sexual sensation seeking, and risky peers norms) and protective factors (e.g., social support, STI knowledge, and refusal to have sex self efficacy) on unsafe sex among 715 African American adolescent females aged 15-21 who participated in an STI/HIV prevention intervention. Generalized estimating equation models were used to assess associations between baseline characteristics and sexual risk over a 12-month follow-up period. Overall risk in this population was high: at baseline, nearly a third of women reported sex under the influence of alcohol or substances; \textgreater 2 partners for vaginal sex, and casual sex partners in the 60 days prior to baseline, and nearly 75 \% of those reporting vaginal sex used condoms inconsistently. In multivariable analysis, when risk and protective factors were simultaneously considered, higher levels of sexual sensation seeking were associated with having multiple sex partners and inconsistent condom use. Greater perception of risky peer norms was associated with a higher risk of having sex under the influence of alcohol or drugs. In addition, higher sex refusal self-efficacy was protective against having multiple; casual; and concurrent sex partners. Incorporating these salient factors into prevention programs may be critical to the development of targeted interventions for this population.

We investigated diminished heart rate variability (HRV) - an index of vagus nerve function and a robust predictor of emotion regulation capacity - as a vulnerability marker that potentially mediates the association between PTE exposure, age and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), psychological distress and aggressive behavior, in a community sample from Timor-Leste - a post-conflict country with a history of mass violence. METHOD: Resting state heart rate data was recorded from 45 cases of PTSD, depression and intermittent explosive disorder (IED); and 29 non-case controls. RESULTS: Resting HRV was significantly reduced in the combined case group compared with non-cases (p = .021; Cohen's d = 0.5). A significant mediation effect was also observed, whereby a sequence of increased age, reduced HRV and elevated PTSD symptoms mediated the association between PTE exposure and distress (B = .06, SE = .05, 95 \% CI = [.00-.217]) and aggression (B = .02, SE = .02, 95 \% CI = [.0003-.069])). CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrate an association between diminished resting HRV and psychopathology. Moreover, age-related HRV reductions emerged as a potential psychophysiological mechanism that underlies enhanced vulnerability to distress and aggression following cumulative PTE exposure.",2016.0,10.1186/s12888-016-0850-5,3T8NIT8N,0,cognitive_additional,591

Inability to form a secure attachment relationship to a primary caregiver is posited to be a central mechanism in this association. We determined whether the ameliorative effect of a foster care (FC) intervention on internalizing disorders in previously institutionalized children was explained by the development of secure attachment among children placed in FC. Second we evaluated the role of lack of attachment in an institutionalized sample on the etiology of internalizing disorders within the context of a randomized trial. METHODS: A sample of 136 children (aged 6-30 months) residing in institutions was recruited in Bucharest, Romania. Children were randomized to FC (n = 68) or to care as usual (CAU; n = 68). Foster parents were recruited, trained, and overseen by the investigative team. Attachment security at 42 months was assessed using the Strange Situation Procedure, and internalizing disorders at 54 months were assessed using the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment. RESULTS: Girls in FC had fewer internalizing disorders than girls in CAU (OR = 0.17, p = .006). The intervention had no effect on internalizing disorders in boys (OR = 0.47, p = .150). At 42 months, girls in FC were more likely to have secure attachment than girls in CAU (OR = 12.5, p \textless .001), but no difference was observed in boys (OR = 2.0, p = .205). Greater attachment security predicted lower rates of internalizing disorders in both sexes. Development of attachment security fully mediated intervention effects on internalizing disorders in girls. CONCLUSION: Placement into FC facilitated the development of secure attachment and prevented the onset of internalizing disorders in institutionalized girls. The differential effects of FC on attachment security in boys and girls explained gender differences in the intervention effects on psychopathology. Findings provide evidence for the critical role of disrupted attachment in the etiology of internalizing disorders in children exposed to institutionalization.",2012.0,10.1111/j.1469-7610.2011.02437.x,9UHS8S7X,0,psychodynamic,594

K.; Gao, W.; Stewart, R. A.; French, J. K.; Aylward, P. E.; Benatar, J.; White, H. D.","BACKGROUND: Lead V(1) directly faces the right ventricle and may exhibit ST elevation during an acute inferior myocardial infarction when the right ventricle is also involved. Leads V(1) and V(3) indirectly face the posterolateral left ventricle, and ST depression ( mirror-image ST elevation) in V(1) through V(3) may reflect concomitant posterolateral infarction. The prognostic significance of V(1) ST elevation during an acute inferior myocardial infarction may therefore be dependent on V(3) ST changes. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 7967 patients with acute inferior myocardial infarction in the Hirulog and Early Reperfusion or Occlusion-2 (HERO-2) trial, V(1) ST levels were analyzed with adjustment for lead V(3) ST level for predicting 30-day mortality. V(1) ST elevation at baseline, analyzed as a continuous variable, was associated with higher mortality. Unadjusted, each 0.5-mm-step increase in ST level above the isoelectric level was associated with approximately 25 \% increase in 30-day mortality; this was true whether V(3) ST depression was present or not. The odds ratio for mortality was 1.21 (95 \% confidence interval, 1.07 to 1.37) after adjustment for inferolateral ST elevation and clinical factors and 1.24 (95 \% confidence interval, 1.09 to 1.40) if also adjusted for V(3) ST level. In contrast, lead V(1) ST depression was not associated with mortality after adjustment for V(3) ST level. V(1) ST elevation \textgreater or=1 mm, analyzed dichotomously in all patients, was associated with higher mortality. The odds ratio was 1.28 (95 \% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.61) unadjusted, 1.51 (95 \% confidence interval, 1.19 to 1.92) adjusted for V(3) ST level, and 1.35 (95 \% confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.76) adjusted for ECG and clinical factors. Persistence of V(1) ST elevation \textgreater or=1 mm 60 minutes after fibrinolysis was associated with higher mortality (10.8 \% versus 5.5 \% , P=0.001).

596,The impact of causal attributions on diagnosis and successful referral of depressed patients in primary care.,"van den Boogaard, Th Michael; Verhaak, P. F. M.; van Dyck, Richard; Spinhoven, Philip","Despite growing concerns of over-treatment, the under-diagnosis and undertreatment of major depressive disorders is still prevalent. Causal attributions are thought to be involved in help seeking behavior, time to diagnosis and the chance for successful referral. Yet, little is known about the extent to which these processes are influenced by causal attributions. 120 patients, involved in the nationwide second Dutch National Survey of General Practice (Schellevis, Westert, \& Bakker, 2005), with a current DSM-IV diagnosis of depression, severe depression or with a depression lasting over six months, completed a causal attributions inventory. Demographic and clinical data from the survey, and causal attribution scores were used as independent variables in association with getting a diagnosis of depression from the general practitioner, or being in treatment by a mental health care provider for more than 3 sessions. Causal attributions related to intrapsychic fears were significantly associated with getting a diagnosis of depression and successful referral. Causal attributions related to childhood were also positively associated with successful referral. In association models derived from all the demographic and clinical data available in the survey, causal attributions substantially contributed to the explained variance, 55 \% and 39 \% respectively. The findings suggest causal attributions have a statistically significant impact on time to diagnosis and the chance of successful referral. Using the Causal Attribution Inventory with high-risk patients in primary care might enhance the chance of detection and successful referral of depressed patients. Schellevis, F. G., Westert, G.

The authors set out to demonstrate the fertile influence of Jung's theories and their relevance to current psychoanalytic practice and research. This is a vast and demanding task and inevitably some of the papers struggle to remain within the confines of Jung's theories. The pitfall comes when a contemporary hermeneutic reading is projected onto theories from an earlier zeitgeist. The two volumes offer a compendium of core Jungian and psychoanalytic concepts blended with findings from attachment theory and affective neuroscience. The editors have succeeded in bringing together papers from both developmental and classical Jungian traditions. The papers are stimulating to read as they vary in style from Francesco Bisagni's and Carlos Melodia's poetic vernacular, illuminated with detailed clinical material, to Susanna Chiesa's succinct and lively dialectical style. These two volumes on Jung Today offer a rich collection of diverse papers reflecting the intellectual breath and diversity of the analytic community in Italy and is an informative read for both trainees and experienced analysts alike.

The French version of the EPDS was used to measure the intensity of postpartum blues on a sample of 859 women, during their stay at the obstetrical clinic. Subjects under treatment for psychological problems were excluded from the study. Mothers scoring 9 or above on the EPDS, which is predictive of postpartum depression, were randomly assigned to a prevention and a control group. Written informed consent was obtained from the subjects after the study procedure had been explained. The prevention group received a counselling session integrating supportive, educational and cognitive-behavioral components. Therapists included five female Master's Degree level students in psychology. All therapists participated in didactic and clinical training as wells as weekly supervision from the first author. All subjects were given a second EPDS with written instructions to complete the questionnaire during the period 4 to 6 weeks postpartum and return it for analysis. At four to 6 weeks, women in the prevention group had significant reductions in the frequency of probable depression, as defined by a score of 11 or above on the EPDS (30.2 \% vs 48.2 \% , x2 = 7.36, dl = 1, p = 0.0067) and in the intensity of depressive symptoms measured by the mean score on the EPDS (8.5, SD = 4vs 10.3, SD = 4.4, t= 3.06, dl = 209, p = 0.0024). Mothers with a probable depression were interviewed at home and assessed using the MINI (Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview, Lecrubier, et al., 1997) to diagnose major depressive episode, the SIGH-D (Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Williams, 1988) and the BDI (Beck Depression Inventory, Beck, et al., 1988). The baseline depression rating scores, EPDS (mean = 13.6, SD = 4), BDI (mean = 15.7, SD = 5.9), HDRS (mean = 14.8, SD = 6), were consistent with moderate depression. No significant differences in baseline scores were observed between the two groups on all the rating scales (p = 7.36, dl = 1, p = 0.0067) and in the intensity of depressive symptoms measured by the mean score on the EPDS (8.5, SD = 4vs 10.3, SD = 4.4, t= 3.06, dl = 209, p = 0.0024).

Fear-related behaviors in mice have long been investigated as potential models of anxiety disorders, making integration of information from both murine and human genetic data a powerful strategy for identifying potential susceptibility genes for these conditions. METHODS: We combined genome-wide association analysis of fear-related behaviors with strain distribution pattern analysis in heterogeneous stock mice to identify a preliminary list of 52 novel candidate genes. We ranked these according to three complementary sources of prior anxiety-related genetic data: 1) extant linkage and knockout studies in mice, 2) a meta-analysis of human linkage scans, and 3) a preliminary human genome-wide association study. We genotyped tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms covering the nine top-ranked regions in a two-stage association study of 1316 subjects from the Virginia Adult Twin Study of Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorders chosen for high or low genetic loading for anxiety-spectrum phenotypes (anxiety disorders, neuroticism, and major depression). RESULTS: Multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms in the PPARGC1A gene demonstrated association in both stages that survived gene-wise correction for multiple testing. CONCLUSIONS: Integration of genetic data across human and murine studies suggests PPARGC1A as a potential susceptibility gene for anxiety-related disorders.",2011.0,10.1016/j.biopsych.2011.07.012,LAT5ETQE,0,personality,602
602,Endogenous cortisol exposure and declarative verbal memory: A longitudinal study of healthy older adults,"Segerstrom, S. C.; Geiger, P. J.; Boggero, I. A.; Schmitt, F. A.; Sephton, S. E.","Objective: Exposure to endogenous cortisol is associated with hippocampal degeneration and may contribute to problems with declarative memory, but effects of persistent versus phasic cortisol elevations have not been established. The present longitudinal investigation examined persistent individual differences and phasic changes in cortisol as they related to verbal memory, executive functions, and subjective cognitive function. Methods: Older adults (n = 132, aged 60-93 years) were followed up for up to 5 years. They were assessed annually for verbal memory and every 6 months for executive functions, subjective cognitive function, and cortisol area under the curve (averaged over 3 days). Results: In multilevel models, persistently but not phasically higher cortisol was associated with worse verbal memory in both learning (t(181) = 2.99, p = .003) and recall (t(280) = 3.10, p = .002). This effect withstood adjustment for stress, depression, metabolic health, and age. There was evidence for attenuated primacy in learning with higher persistent cortisol. Phasic increases in cortisol were not associated with changes in memory, and cortisol was not related to executive functions or subjective cognitive function. Conclusions: Higher secretion of cortisol may, over time, contribute to memory dysfunction in older adults.",2016.0,10.1097/PSY.0000000000000249,2S67QUA2,0,diathesis,603
603,Frequency and perceived effectiveness of coping define important subgroups of patients with chronic pain,"Roditi, D.; Waxenberg, L.; Robinson, M. E.","Objectives: Investigate the relationship between frequency and perceived effectiveness of coping strategies used to cope with chronic pain. Examine the association between these variables and pain-related negative mood. Methods: Retrospective review of psychological measures completed by 122 adult chronic pain patients seen at a multidisciplinary pain clinic at the University of Florida. Empirical subgroups according to reported frequency and perceived effectiveness of coping strategies used were identified resulting in a 4-group solution based on combinations of high versus low effectiveness and high versus low frequency of use. Results: Analysis of variance results revealed significantly higher levels of distress (depression and pain-related anxiety) for selected subgroups [F(2,99)=4.902, P \textless 0.05, $\eta$=0.09 and F(2,93)=3.504, P \textless 0.05, $\eta$=0.07, respectively]. Post-hoc analyses revealed significantly more depression (mean=20.20, SD=9.77) and more pain-related anxiety (mean=101.07, SD=35.78) in individuals frequently using ineffective coping as compared with those reporting frequent use of effective coping (Mean depression =14.88, SDdepression =7.40; Mean pain-related anxiety=78.93, SDpain -related anxiety=32.26) and those reporting infrequent use of ineffective coping (Mean depression =13.89, SDdepression=9.44). DISCUSSION: Perceived effectiveness and frequency of coping strategy use may influence pain-related negative mood. Maladaptive coping may be a risk factor associated with more emotional distress; it is also possible that more emotional distress predisposes maladaptive coping. Taking into account both the frequency of coping strategy use and the perceived effectiveness of strategy type is suggested for future studies. \textcopyright 2010 by Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.",2010.0,10.1097/AJP.0b013e3181ed187f,S23FTEX2,0,cognitive_additional,604
604,Typus melancholicus and the Temperament and Character Inventory personality dimensions in patients with major depression.,"Kimura, S.; Sato, T.; Takahashi, T.; Narita, T.; Hirano, S.; Goto, M.","Although many clinical studies have been conducted to determine the etiological role and clinical implications of typus melancholicus for unipolar depression, maladaptive personality features in depressive patients have not been well described. This study explores typus melancholicus, as measured by the rigidity subscale of the Munich Personality Test, and maladaptive personality features, as measured by the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), in 131 remitted patients with DSM-IV major depression and 154 normal controls. The patients reported significantly higher scores on rigidity and harm avoidance and significantly lower scores on self-directedness and cooperativeness. Only 23.6 \ \% \ of the variance of the rigidity scale was explained by the variance of the seven TCI scales, in which only persistence was significantly correlated positively to rigidity. Cluster analysis identified four subgroups, two of which were characterized by a high rigidity score. One of these two subgroups showed no maladaptive personality features, as measured by the TCI, while the other showed high harm avoidance and low self-directedness. These results indicate that the personality of depressive patients is characterized not only by typus melancholicus but also by maladaptive personality features, that typus melancholicus is not well represented by any TCI scale, and that typus melancholicus and maladaptive personality features can coexist in some depressive patients.",2000.0,10.1046/j.1440-1819.2000.00656.x,68PYYAXL,0,personality,605
605,Long-term nature of depression.,"Thase, M. E.","Many, if not most, people with depression are at high risk to develop a recurrent and potentially chronic disorder, characterized by deleterious effects on vocational, social, and family functioning. Recent evidence also suggests that recurrent episodes of severe depression are associated with changes in brain function that further heighten vulnerability and functional impairment. The best way to deal with these sobering problems is prevention via vigorous treatment of the index episode (to produce complete remission) and more routine use of longer term models of prophylactic therapy. After briefly reviewing the relevant data on epidemiology and natural history, this article focuses on the 4 arms of preventative treatment: psychoeducation, pharmacotherapy, adherence, and psychotherapy. Like the modern approach to treatment of hypertension, a conscientious and integrated approach to preventative therapy saves lives and has profoundly beneficial effects for our patients, their loved ones, and society.",1999.0,,G73RBXBJ,0,cognitive,606
606,Default mode network connectivity in children with a history of preschool onset depression.,"Gaffrey, Michael S.; Luby, Joan L.; Botteron, Kelly; Repovs, Grega; Barch, Deanna M.","BACKGROUND: Atypical Default Mode Network (DMN) functional connectivity has been previously reported in depressed adults. However, there is relatively little data informing the developmental nature of this phenomenon. The current case-control study examined the DMN in a unique prospective sample of school-age children with a previous history of preschool depression. METHODS: DMN functional connectivity was assessed using resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging data and the posterior cingulate (PCC) as a seed region of interest. Thirty-nine medication naive school age children (21 with a history of preschool depression and 18 healthy peers) and their families who were ascertained as preschoolers and prospectively assessed over at least 4 annual waves as part of a federally funded study of preschool depression were included. RESULTS: Decreased connectivity between the PCC and regions within the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), inferior parietal lobule, and cerebellum was found in children with known depression during the preschool period. Increased connectivity between the PCC and regions within the subgenual and anterior cingulate cortices and anterior MTG bilaterally was also found in these children. Additionally, a clinically relevant 'brain-behavior' relationship between atypical functional connectivity of the PCC and disruptions in emotion regulation was identified. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the DMN in children known to have experienced the onset of a clinically significant depressive syndrome during preschool. Results suggest that a history of preschool depression is associated with atypical DMN connectivity. However, longitudinal studies are needed to clarify whether the current findings of atypical DMN connectivity are a precursor or a consequence of preschool depression.",2012.0,10.1111/j.1469-7610.2012.02552.x,IVRKYW62,0,cognitive_additional,607

College students (n = 256) completed an online survey in 2003. Instruments included the Sexual Compulsivity Scale (SCS), Sexual Sensation Seeking Scale (SSS), and the College Alcohol Problem Scale (CAPS). Men scored higher on the SSS and SCS than women. Women who belong to Greek organizations reported significantly more personal problems, including depression and low self-esteem, after consuming alcohol than women who were not members of Greek organizations. Four predictor variables associated with HIV risk behaviors were age, high score on SSS and CAPS, but a low score on SCS. The personality dispositions of sexual sensation seeking and compulsivity among college students may need to be explored in other college settings, to determine if these traits are related to HIV risk taking behaviors. Interventions to help women better cope with the effects of alcohol and self-esteem issues may be beneficial. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",,,G6XU7QCL,0,cognitive,608

Then, some representative interventions that have been informed by attachment theory are reviewed. This theoretical and empirical exposition serves at the backdrop for describing the attachment-informed intervention, toddler-parent psychotherapy that is provided to depressed mothers and their toddlers. Present outcome data on the efficacy of the preventive intervention is then presented. Finally, in order to provide a more fine-grained analysis of the implementation and course of the preventive intervention, the authors examine two case studies, incorporating information on the mothers' representational models of their childhood attachment relationships, their representations of their child, and the mother-child attachment relationship prior to the provision of intervention. Follow-up information on these same constructs after completion of the intervention also is examined. The presentation of these case studies is framed so as to inform issues relevant to theoretical conceptualizations of attachment. Before turning to the specific intervention, a framework for understanding why offspring of depressed mothers are at risk for the development of insecure attachment relationships and, therefore, why the provision of an attachment-informed intervention is considered to be important is provided.

N.; Drysdale, L.; Poulter, M. O.; Roth, B. L.; Pin, J. P.; Anisman, H.; Ferguson, S. S. G.","Stress and anxiety disorders are risk factors for depression and these behaviors are modulated by corticotrophin-releasing factor receptor 1 (CRFR1) and serotonin receptor (5-HT 2 R). However, the potential behavioral and cellular interaction between these two receptors is unclear. We found that pre-administration of corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) into the prefrontal cortex of mice enhanced 5-HT 2 R-mediated anxiety behaviors in response to 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine. In both heterologous cell cultures and mouse cortical neurons, activation of CRFR1 also enhanced 5-HT 2 receptor-mediated inositol phosphate formation. CRFR1-mediated increases in 5-HT 2 R signaling were dependent on receptor internalization and receptor recycling via rapid recycling endosomes, resulting in increased expression of 5-HT 2 R on the cell surface. Sensitization of 5-HT 2 R signaling by CRFR1 required intact PDZ domain-binding motifs at the end of the C-terminal tails of both receptor types. These data suggest a mechanism by which CRF, a peptide known to be released by stress, enhances anxiety-related behavior via sensitization of 5-HT 2 R signaling. \textcopyright 2010 Nature America, Inc.

The present study hypothesized that differences in conceptual complexity (CC) may mediate individuals' cognitive and emotional responses toward problem situations. 106 undergraduates high and low in CC (as measured by the Paragraph Completion Method) first imagined a neutral scene and then situations involving social rejection and academic failure, followed by assessments of attributions, self- and task statements, and change in negative affect (the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List). High-CC Ss reported more internal attributions and fewer negative task statements and showed less increases in negative mood. Although the findings have internal validity, additional research is needed before links between CC and particular cognitive/affective processes in cognitive restructuring can be determined.

AIMS: To investigate if patients with depressive and/or anxiety disorders can achieve a level of physical activity meeting public health recommendations, increase their physical fitness and quality of life (QoL) through participation in a physical exercise programme. METHODS: In a non-blinded controlled study, 48 patients referred by private psychiatric clinics and private general practices were either treated in an intervention (n=27) or a control group (n=21). The intervention group took part in 20 weeks of group exercise consisting of aerobic training and non-aerobic weight-lifting.

The VO(2)max increase was maintained after a 12-week follow-up period. Findings should be conservatively interpreted because of high attrition rate. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with anxiety and/or depressive disorders who participated in a structured, supervised exercise programme achieved in accordance with public health recommendations a higher level of physical activity and VO(2)max.

616,"A Preliminary, Qualitative Exploration of the Influences Associated with Drop-Out from Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy for Problem Gambling: An Australian Perspective","Dunn, K.; Delfabbro, P.; Harvey, P.","It has been estimated that 80 \% of Australians engage in some form of gambling, with approximately 115,000 Australians experiencing severe problems (Productivity Commission 2010). Very few people with problem gambling seek help and, of those who do, large numbers drop-out of therapy before completing their program. To gain insights into these problems, participants who had either completed or withdrawn prematurely from an individual CBT-based problem gambling treatment program were interviewed to examine factors predictive of premature withdrawal from therapy as well as people's 'readiness' for change. The results indicated that there might be some early indicators of risk for early withdrawal. These included: gambling for pleasure or social interaction; non-compliance with homework tasks; gambling as a strategy to avoid personal issues or dysphoric mood; high levels of guilt and shame; and a lack of readiness for change. The study further showed that application of the term 'drop-out' to some clients may be an unnecessarily negative label in that a number appear to have been able to reduce their gambling urges even after a short exposure to therapy. \textcopyright 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",2012.0,,A4XMUGKB,0,psychodynamic,617

He was treated with a combination therapy of antipsychotics and antidepressants during long-term hospitalization. At the age of 69, he relapsed and was admitted to the hospital again. He was initially treated with olanzapine and lithium for the treatment of bipolar depression with psychotic features. He partially responded to the combination therapy, and psychomotor retardation and delusion of guilt disappeared; however, he developed psychomotor agitation and delusion of persecution, which was a mood-incongruent psychotic feature.

Lynn; Wilson, Nancy L.; Looman, Wendy J.; McCarthy, Catherine; Morgan, Robert; Ablorh-Odjidja, Clair; Kunik, Mark E.","OBJECTIVES: : This investigation was guided by the stress process model and had two objectives: first, to describe the extent of negative caregiving effects for family caregivers of veterans with dementia, and second, to identify salient predictors of negative caregiving effects. DESIGN: : Data were obtained from baseline, structured telephone interviews with family caregivers of veterans enrolled in Partners in Dementia Care, a clinical trial testing a care coordination intervention. PARTICIPANTS: : The study included 486 family caregivers of veterans with dementia who received primary care from the Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare system and lived at home. MEASUREMENT: : Six negative caregiving effects were described as follows: unmet needs, four role and intrapsychic strains, and depression. Predictive factors included the following: cognitive impairment, behavior problems, personal care dependency, number of chronic conditions, and characteristics of the caregiving context. RESULTS: : Sizeable portions of caregivers experienced negative caregiving effects; most common were unmet needs, social isolation, and depression. Cognitive, behavioral, and functional symptoms of dementia and other coexisting chronic conditions explained significant variation in all negative caregiving effects. Caregiving context had little impact. Behavior problems were the most consistent predictor; personal care dependency and other chronic conditions were also important. CONCLUSIONS: : Family caregivers, the foundation of long-term care for veterans with dementia who live at home, experience a variety of negative caregiving effects. Negative effects are greater when veterans exhibit behavior problems, require extensive assistance with personal care, and have a greater number of coexisting chronic conditions. Negative caregiving effects are an important target for interventions that support family caregivers and promote continued care at home.",2012.0,10.1097/JGP.0b013e31824108ca,55YTHUQ2,0,cognitive,619

Although different pharmacologic agents are suggested for treatment of PTSD, none have been completely effective in eliminating symptoms. The purpose of this study was to assess the use of baclofen as an add-on to citalopram in treatment of PTSD. METHODS: In this double-blind clinical trial, 40 Iranian combat veterans with PTSD were randomly assigned to 2 groups. The first group received a combination treatment of 20 to 60 mg/d citalopram and 40 mg/d baclofen, and the second group received 20 to 60 mg/d citalopram plus placebo. Symptom severity was assessed by Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale at the beginning of the study and after 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks. Global Assessment of Functioning and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety and Depression were also used at the same periods. Data were analyzed with independent t test and paired t test using SPSS software version 13 (IBM, Armonk, NY). RESULTS: Twenty-three male patients (baclofen group, 13 patients; placebo group, 10 patients) completed the study. Dropout from the treatment was not caused by adverse effects of the new medications in any of the subjects. Baclofen group showed significantly larger improvement in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale total (P = 0.040), hyperarousal (P = 0.020), and avoidance (0.020) scores, Global Assessment of Functioning score (0.001), depression (P = 0.000), and anxiety (P = 0.000) after 8 weeks of treatment.

In addition, classifying psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) into subtypes has been found to be clinically relevant. However, very few studies have addressed differences in optimism, pessimism, or neuropsychological performance among PNES subtypes. We previously classified adults with PNES into semiology-based subtypes (catatonic, minor motor, major motor). In the study described here, we compared subtypes on optimism, pessimism, depressive symptoms, and neuropsychological performance. We found that patients with PNES with low optimism had significantly greater depressive symptoms than patients with high optimism, F(2, 39)=36.49, P \ \textless \ 0.01). Moreover, patients with high pessimism had significantly greater depressive symptoms than patients with low pessimism, F(2, 39)=13.66, P \ \textless \ 0.01. We also found that the catatonic subtype was associated with fewer depressive symptoms and better verbal memory than the other PNES subtypes. Our results support relationships between optimism, pessimism, and depressive symptoms and extend these findings to a PNES sample.

622,Pharmacokinetic evaluation of pregabalin for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder,"Buoli, M.; Caldiroli, A.; Serati, M.","INTRODUCTION: Pregabalin is an alternative compound to SSRIs and SNRIs for the first-line treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Areas covered: We describe the pharmacokinetic properties of pregabalin and their implications for the treatment of GAD. A search in the main database sources (Medline, ISI, Web of Knowledge and Medscape) was performed in order to obtain a comprehensive and balanced evaluation about the clinical implications of the pharmacokinetic properties of pregabalin in the treatment of GAD. The word ""pregabalin"" was associated with ""pharmacokinetics"", ""interactions""', ""GAD"", ""anxiety"" and ""tolerability"". No restriction criteria were established in relation to methodology or publication year. Only English-language articles were selected. Expert opinion: Pregabalin is a safe and efficacious compound for GAD treatment. Short half-life (preventing persistence of side effects), absence of active metabolites and no interactions with CYP450 enzymatic system are all favorable pharmacokinetic properties for the treatment of GAD patients, including those with comorbid depressive symptoms or medical conditions. On the other hand, prescription of pregabalin should be handled with caution to minimize the incidence of renal impairment (especially in elderly patients), where a history of substance misuse or concomitant medications (e.g. anti-hypertensives or some antibiotics) are risk factors that can affect renal function.",2017.0,10.1080/17425255.2017.1281247,959NAPJA,0,additional,623
623,Is risk for mania associated with increased daydreaming as a form of mental imagery?,"Meyer, Thomas D.; Finucane, Lucy; Jordan, Gabriele","BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder and risk for mania are associated with setting high goals and dysregulated goal pursuit. One mechanism mediating between setting high goals and manic symptoms could be daydreaming or more generally, mental imagery. 'Daydreams' (as one form of mental imagery) are characterized by the fact that the content is produced deliberately. Akiskal et al. (1995) reported that daydreaming prospectively predicted a switch from unipolar depression to bipolar disorder. We here hypothesized that risk for mania should also be associated with increased daydreaming after controlling for depression. METHOD: N=249 participants from a non-clinical, community sample completed several self-report measures including the Hypomanic Personality scale and Daydreaming scale. RESULTS: Hierarchical regression revealed that risk for mania predicted daydreaming after controlling for current and former depression. LIMITATIONS: Only self-report measures were used. The sample was a non-clinical, primarily White British sample, which has implications for generalizability. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limitations our results support the hypothesis that vulnerability for mania is associated with daydreaming. Daydreaming was related to mania and depression which highlights that it might be relevant for the etiology or maintenance of mood disorders.",2011.0,10.1016/j.jad.2011.06.002,BK45JZXW,0,personality,624

C.","The author compared a group of patients with borderline personality disorder with groups of subjects with antisocial personality and bipolar II illness. The lifetime prevalence at interview of DSM-III major depression was high in all groups. Chronic depression demonstrated a specific relationship to borderline psychopathology. Prospectively, borderline psychopathology predicted high levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms. This relationship was reversed for depressive symptoms in patients with antisocial personality disorder, suggesting that when borderline and antisocial personality disorders occur together, some features may arise that differentiate patients with both disorders from those with either disorder alone.",1985.0,10.1176/ajp.142.1.15,JJBQA6Y7,0,personality,625
625,"Trajectories, antecedents, and outcomes of childhood somatization in school-age boys.","Beck, Joy E.","The current study had three goals that were designed to extend our understanding of childhood somatization (SOM). The first goal was to use a group-based trajectory analysis to plot developmental pathways of SOM. The second goal was to use a developmental psychopathology framework to identify risk factors from multiple domains that discriminated SOM trajectories. The third and final goal was to examine the relationship between child maladjustment, including functional impairment, and SOM trajectory group status. These goals were conducted with a sample of 310 ethnically diverse, low-income boys followed longitudinally from ages 2 to 12, using multiple methods and informants. Similar to research using broadly-defined internalizing behaviors, three developmental trajectories were identified: No, Low Increasing, and Moderate Increasing. The majority of the boys (i.e., 82 \% ) were reported as displaying at least low to moderate levels of SOM across childhood. In addition to these three trajectories, a small group of boys (n = 5) demonstrated a distinct pattern of SOM, called the Moderate to High (MTH) group. Follow-up analyses indicated that the Moderate Increasing group was differentiated from the No group by higher levels of maternal depressive symptoms and parent-child conflict, whereas the MTH group demonstrated lower levels of social skills than the other three groups. Higher levels of both child negative affectivity and parent-child conflict discriminated the Low Increasing group from the No group. Differences in child outcomes at ages 11 and 12 were not found. The implications of the results for clinical intervention and future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",2007.0,,MVMDDKJ8,0,behavior,626

A web-based peer forum may provide a safe and anonymous place for mutual support. Aims: This study examined the mental health changes of visitors of two online support forums for persons bereaved by suicide and their experiences with the forum over 1 year. Method: Visitors of two forums completed self-report measures at baseline and at 6 and 12 months' follow-up. Repeated measures analyses were used to study changes in well-being, depressive symptoms, and complicated grief. Additionally, participants were interviewed about their experiences with the forum. Results: The 270 participants were mostly female, low in well-being, with high levels of depressive symptoms and complicated grief. Suicidal risk was high for 5.9 \% . At 12 months, there were small to medium-sized significant improvements in well-being and depressive symptoms (p \textless .001) and nearly as much for grief (p = .08). About two thirds reported benefit from visiting the forum. Because of the pre-post design we cannot determine whether a causal relationship exists between the form and changes in mental health. Conclusion: After 1 year some positive changes but a large group was still struggling with their mental health. Interviews indicate that the forum was valued for finding recognition.

627,The Dark Side of DSM-III.,"VanValkenburg, Charles","Reviews the book, New Psychiatric Syndromes: DSM-III and Beyond edited by Salman Akhtar (1983). The text pays little attention to the affective disorders and schizophrenia that are the spirit of DSM-III. The introduction does pass brief and mainly unargued psychodynamic judgment on several of DSM-III's major decisions concerning these diagnoses. It is written skillfully but relies heavily on the Greek baffle-gab and loose logical associations that for so many years protected the general public and psychodynamic thought from each other. The author's assertion that the diagnosis of somatization disorder requires some acceptance of psychodynamic theory indicates that he has missed the whole point of diagnosis by operational criteria.

628,A modern therapeutic approach for chronically mentally ill patients - Results of a four-year prospective study,"Eikelmann, B.; Reker, T.","A 4-year prospective study was carried out on 53 chronically mentally ill patients living in a differentiated complementary residential complex. Our main question was how the lives of these patients develop, as reflected in their psychological well-being, working capacity, therapeutic requirements and any necessary periods of rehospitalization. At the end of a 4-year rehabilitation period, 50 \% of the patients were living in sheltered communities and about 25 \% on their own. Only 10 \% had returned to the psychiatric hospital as long-term patients. The psychological findings were characterized by apathetic, depressive and psycho-organic syndromes (AMDP system) and were subject overall to minimum variation. Very few patients succeeded in obtaining work on the general labour market, but the work available on the sheltered labour market was suitable for a large proportion (40 \% ) of them. All patients were undergoing medical care after 4 years. Patients suffering from chronic mental disorders can be cared for in the community even after long-term hospitalization. Special success has been achieved with rehabilitation in the residential sphere. Adequate care implies numerous services to ensure that patients are integrated into the labour market, to help establish contacts and to enable chronically ill patients to take part in social and cultural life. Most patients retain a considerable degree of psychological disturbance and are permanently dependent on psychiatric therapy or psychosocial care. On the other hand, they benefit from the fact that their living circumstances are largely normal and that they have higher degree of personal autonomy.",1991.0,,YKQ4VGZ4,0,cognitive_additional,629
629,"Using distance regulation for the study of sibling relationship quality, romantic relationships, and interpersonal and intrapersonal factors","Palmer, Elizabeth Northup","The sibling bond is likely the longest, most resilient relationship in one's life. Subsequently, the sibling relationship is a strong predictor of outcomes across the lifespan, including positive intimate relationships, feelings of self-worth, and social skills. The purpose of this dissertation was to use Bowen Family Systems Theory (BFST) to examine individual's perception of their sibling relationships and the connection with interpersonal and intrapersonal factors, and to explore the congruence of sibling and romantic relationship distance regulation. Online research listservs were used to recruit participants ( N=476). A cross-sectional descriptive survey design was used to explore quantitative survey items. The Lifespan Sibling Relationship Scale (LSRS) was used to assess the sibling relationship in childhood and adulthood. The Social Connectedness Scale-Revised (SCSR) and the Separation-Individuation Test of Adolescence (SITA) were used to measure distance regulation. Interpersonal and intrapersonal factors included depression, general perceptions of health, and couple relationship satisfaction. BFST was used to explore four hypotheses: 1) The ""closest"" siblings will be same-sex dyads, with sisters being the closest among all the dyads; 2) Siblings that are 2.5 years apart in age; 3) Individuals' perceptions of the sibling relationship in childhood and adulthood are related; and 4) The sibling relationship in childhood and adulthood are predictive of inter/intrapersonal factors. In addition, three research questions were explored: 1) Are there common characteristics of the selected ""influential sibling"" for participants with more than one sibling?; 2) What is the relationship between sibling and couple distance regulation?; and 3) To what extent does sibling and couple distance regulation mediate the influence of the sibling relationship on inter/intrapersonal factors? Correlations confirmed a significant relationship between the sibling relationship in childhood and adulthood (r(476)=.45, p<.001). A one-way ANOVA demonstrated sisters were the closest on both the LSRS (F(3, 458)= 7.87, p<.001), and the SCSR (F(3, 458)=5.38, p=.001). There were not significant differences between siblings > or <= 2.5 years apart in age. The subsample of participants in a romantic relationship was used ( n=338) to test the conceptual model using structural equation modeling. First, a direct effects model assessed the influence of the adult and sibling relationship on depression, general perceptions of health, and couple relationship satisfaction. Results showed significant paths from the child sibling relationship to depression (beta=-.14, p<.05) and couple relationship satisfaction (beta=.21, p<.05). Then, sibling and couple distance regulation were added as mediating variables to complete the model. Fit indices for the overall model were strong: X2 (56)=76.41 (p=.036); NFI=.974;CFI=.993; RMSEA=.033. There were significant indirect effects of the paths from the child sibling relationship, through couple distance regulation, to general perceptions of health (beta=.04, p<.05), depression (beta=-.02, p<.05), and couple relationship satisfaction (beta=.29, p<.05). These results provide evidence for the importance of the sibling relationship in childhood on interpersonal and intrapersonal factors in adulthood. Additionally, distance regulation may be a useful concept to examine how this influence occurs. Applications of the results to mental health clinicians, and strengths, limitations and future directions are discussed herein.

E.; Lynn, J.","OBJECTIVE: To characterize the dying experience of patients with cancer over the last 6 months of life. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of the last 6 months of life among patients with colon cancer and non-small cell lung cancer enrolled in a prospective cohort study from June 1989 to June 1991 and from January 1992 to January 1994. SETTING: Five geographically diverse tertiary care academic medical centers participating in the Study to Understand Patient Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT) Project. PARTICIPANTS: All patients enrolled in SUPPORT who had either colon cancer, metastatic to the liver or stage III or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer and died within 1 year of their index hospitalization. This report examines 316 of 520 patients with metastatic colon cancer and 747 of 939 patients with lung cancer enrolled in SUPPORT. METHODS: Data were collected by interview and chart abstraction at several time points in the SUPPORT Project. To describe progression to death, we constructed four observational windows backward in time beginning with patients' date of death and ending with their date of entry into the SUPPORT Project or 6 months before their death, whichever came first: (1) 3 days before death, (2) 3 days to 1 month before death, (3) 1 month to 3 months before death, and (4) 3 months to 6 months before death. For each outcome, patients contributed information to all windows during which they had data collected. We describe the frequency distributions of each outcome over time and report tests for trend. OUTCOME MEASURES: We examined several outcomes over time, including: percentage of days spent in a hospital; prognosis as measured by model-based prognostic estimates of 6-month survival; severity of illness as measured by the acute physiology score; functional status as measured by dependencies in activities of daily living (ADLs); severe physical and emotional symptoms, including pain, depression, and anxiety; patients' preferences for care; and the financial impact on patients' families. RESULTS: The death rate within 1 year of study entry was high among patients with metastatic colon cancer and advanced non-small cell lung cancer enrolled in SUPPORT (61 \% and 80 \% , respectively). As patients with cancer progress toward death, their estimated 6-month prognosis decreases significantly and the severity of their disease worsens. Patients' functional status also declines significantly as they approach death, such that most patients have four or more impairments within the 3 days before death. Patients with cancer experience significantly more pain and confusion as death approaches. Severe pain is common; more than one-quarter of patients with cancer experience serious pain 3 to 6 months before death and more than 40 \% were in serious pain during their last 3 days of life. However, dying patients are only modestly depressed and anxious during their last 3 days of life. As death approaches, patients favor comfort measures over life-extension, and about two-thirds want to forego resuscitation within 3 days of death. Families of patients dying with cancer incurred significant financial burdens during the last 6 months of life, and much of this burden was already experienced by 3 to 6 months before death. CONCLUSIONS: The last 6 months of life for patients with cancer is characterized by functional decline and poorly controlled severe pain and confusion. Although patients increasingly prefer comfort care as they near death, many die in severe pain. These findings highlight important opportunities to improve the quality of care at the end of life for patients dying with cancer.",2000.0,,D3KYNGMS,0,cognitive,631

Low-ASE contexts should present challenges to abstinence. In this study, the authors used profile correlations to quantify the relationship between context-specific ASE ratings and the characteristics of lapse episodes. To assess the distinctiveness of this relationship, they also correlated the situations surrounding temptation and randomly selected (nontemptation) episodes with context-specific ASE. The ASE-first lapse profile correlation was significantly greater than zero and significantly greater than ASE-temptation and ASE-nontemptation correlations. This pattern of results remained when multiple lapse episodes were considered. Thus, low-ASE contexts tend to be associated with lapses to smoking.",2002.0,,Q4ZE4LVZ,0,behavior,633

We used a cross-sectional design and performed resting-state FC MRI to assess connectivity of the SN, CCN, and both anterior and posterior DMN in 17 severe TRD, 18 non-TRD, and 18 healthy control (HC) subjects. Relative to both non-TRD and HC subjects, TRD patients showed decreased FC between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and angular gyrus, which suggests reduced FC between the CCN and DMN, and reduced FC between the medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus/cuneus, which suggests reduced FC between the anterior and posterior DMN. No significant differences in SN FC were observed.

E.","OBJECTIVE: To examine and compare the profile of cognitive symptoms, somatic symptoms, and somatic complaints in younger and older medical inpatients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD). DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort. PATIENTS AND SETTING: Male patients aged 20-39 years (n = 116) and aged 70-102 years (n = 332), consecutively admitted to the medical and neurological services of a VA medical center, underwent psychiatric evaluations for depression. MEASUREMENTS: Depressive symptoms were measured using the observer-rated Hamilton Depression Scale and the self-rated Geriatric Depression Scale using an inclusive approach (symptoms rated regardless of etiology). Data on 12 common somatic complaints were also collected. Clinical diagnoses of MDD were made by a psychiatrist based on the Diagnostic Interview Schedule and other psychiatric and physical health data. RESULTS: After controlling for severity of medical illness, functional status, and alcohol use, symptoms that discriminated MDD best among younger men were loss of interest, feelings of guilt or of being a burden, suicidal thoughts, and depressed mood (primarily cognitive and affective symptoms). Among older men, loss of interest, insomnia, suicidal thoughts, and hypochondriasis most strongly differentiated depressed from non-depressed patients (mixture of cognitive and somatic symptoms); fatigue, weight loss, genital symptoms, and somatic anxiety were weakly related or unrelated to MDD. Number of somatic complaints (headache, dizziness, palpitations, etc.) helped differentiate patients with MDD; although equally common among depressed young and older patients, a distinct pattern of complaints emerged in each age group. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive symptoms of depression can help to distinguish medical inpatients with and without MDD. In older adults, however, somatic symptoms cannot be ignored and may be more important for diagnosing MDD than previously realized. These findings will help clinicians identify patients with MDD and differentiate them from non-depressed patients with medical illness.",1993.0,,SWJPX7VA,0,psychodynamic,635
635,Interaction of the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region and environmental adversity: Increased amygdala-hypothalamus connectivity as a potential mechanism linking neural and endocrine hyperreactivity,"Alexander, N.; Klucken, T.; Koppe, G.; Osinsky, R.; Walter, B.; Vaitl, D.; Sammer, G.; Stark, R.; Hennig, J.","Background: Gene by environment (G×E) interaction between genetic variation in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region [5-HTTLPR]) and stressful life events (SLEs) has been extensively studied in the context of depression. Recent findings suggest increased neural and endocrine stress sensitivity as a possible mechanism conveying elevated vulnerability to psychopathology. Furthermore, these G×E mediated alterations very likely reflect interrelated biological processes. Methods: In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study, amygdala reactivity to fearful stimuli was assessed in healthy male adults (n = 44), who were previously found to differ with regard to endocrine stress reactivity as a function of 5-HTTLPR × SLEs. Furthermore, functional connectivity between the amygdala and the hypothalamus was measured as a potential mechanism linking elevated neural and endocrine responses during stressful/threatening situations. The study sample was carefully preselected regarding 5-HTTLPR genotype and SLEs. Results: We report significant G×E interaction on neural response patterns and functional amygdala-hypothalamus connectivity. Specifically, homozygous carriers of the 5-HTTLPR S' allele with a history of SLEs (S'S'/high SLEs group) displayed elevated bilateral amygdala activation in response to fearful faces. Within the same sample, a comparable G×E interaction effect has previously been demonstrated regarding increased cortisol reactivity, indicating a cross-validation of heightened biological stress sensitivity. Furthermore, S'S'/high SLEs subjects were characterized by an increased functional coupling between the right amygdala and the hypothalamus, thus indicating a potential link between neural and endocrine hyperreactivity. Conclusions: The present findings contribute to the ongoing debate on 5-HTTLPR × SLEs interaction and are discussed with respect to clinical implications. \textcopyright 2012 Society of Biological Psychiatry.",2012.0,10.1016/j.biopsych.2012.01.030,FA22WK4L,0,diathesis,636

637,General Issues in Psychological Treatment for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.,"Tolin, David F.; Steketee, Gail","The most widely tested psychological treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is exposure and response prevention (ERP; also known as exposure and ritual prevention), in which patients are gradually exposed to their obsessive feared situations and asked not to engage in rituals or avoidance behaviors. This intervention typically leads to reductions in negative emotions such as anxiety, guilt, and depression; to shifts in beliefs about the probability of harm; and to increased tolerance of intrusive thoughts. It also reduces avoidance behaviors and mental and behavioral rituals that reinforce the obsessive thoughts. Formal cognitive therapy (based on Beck's model; Beck, Emery, \& Greenberg, 1985) may also provide relief from OCD symptoms, as do serotonergic medications. This chapter focuses on the clinician's decision making and implementation of interventions for OCD. We address indications and contraindications for ERP, when to consider combining ERP with cognitive therapy and medications, various formats for delivering ERP, how to do a functional analysis and select treatment targets, and the influence of comorbidity on treatment decisions. We also review motivational strategies, whether to involve family members in exposure treatment, other aspects of the patient's life that can influence treatment, and finally, how to help patients maintain their own gains. Our recommendations for ERP implementation are based on research findings that we describe briefly in each section to set the stage for clinical decision making.

Next, the ERN is discussed in terms of three psychiatric disorders characterized by abnormal response monitoring: anxiety disorders, depression, and substance abuse. These data indicate that increased and decreased error-related brain activity is associated with the internalizing and externalizing dimensions of psychopathology, respectively. Recent data further suggest that abnormal error-processing indexed by the ERN indexes trait- but not state-related symptoms, especially related to anxiety.

Subliminal affective priming methods allowed for the assessment of unconscious affective reactions. An affective priming task using masked sad and happy faces, both of which are approach-related facial expressions, was administered to 30 healthy volunteers. Participants also completed the Relationship Scales Questionnaire and measures of anxiety and depression. Attachment avoidance was negatively associated with affective priming due to sad (but not happy) facial expressions. This association occurred independently of attachment anxiety, depressivity, and trait anxiety. Attachment anxiety was not correlated with priming due to sad or happy facial expressions. The present results are consistent with the assumption that attachment avoidance moderates automatic affective reaction to sad faces. Our data indicate that avoidant attachment is related to a low automatic affective responsivity to sad facial expressions.

The goal of this study was to test a model including nicotine dependence and number of daily cigarettes as dependent variables, anxiety and depression as independent variables, and smoking outcome expectancies and metacognitions about smoking as mediators between the independents and dependents. METHODS: The sample consisted of 524 self-declared smokers who scored 3 or above on the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND: Uysal et al., 2004). RESULTS: Anxiety was not associated with either cigarette use or nicotine dependence but was positively associated with all mediators with the exception of stimulation state enhancement and social facilitation. Depression, on the other hand, was found to be positively associated with nicotine dependence (and very weakly to cigarette use) but was not associated with either smoking outcome expectancies or metacognitions about smoking. Only one smoking outcome expectancy (negative affect reduction) was found to be positively associated with nicotine dependence but not cigarette use. Furthermore one smoking outcome expectancy (negative social impression) was found to be positively associated with cigarette use (but not to nicotine dependence). All metacognitions about smoking were found to be positively associated with nicotine dependence. Moreover, negative metacognitions about uncontrollability were found to be positively associated with cigarette use.

An exploratory record based analysis,"Menon, V.; Kattimani, S.; Sarkar, S.; Mathan, K.","Background: Evidence indicates that repeat suicide attempters, as a group, may differ from 1st time attempters. The identification of repeat attempters is a powerful but underutilized clinical variable. Aims: In this research, we aimed to compare individuals with lifetime histories of multiple attempts with 1st time attempters to identify factors predictive of repeat attempts. Setting and Design: This was a retrospective record based study carried out at a teaching cum Tertiary Care Hospital in South India. Methods: Relevant data was extracted from the clinical records of 1st time attempters (n = 362) and repeat attempters (n = 61) presenting to a single Tertiary Care Center over a 4 half year period. They were compared on various sociodemographic and clinical parameters. The clinical measures included Presumptive Stressful Life Events Scale, Beck Hopelessness Scale, Coping Strategies Inventory - Short Form, and the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale. Statistical Analysis Used: First time attempters and repeaters were compared using appropriate inferential statistics. Logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of repeat attempts. Results: The two groups did not significantly differ on sociodemographic characteristics. Repeat attempters were more likely to have given prior hints about their act ($\chi$2 = 4.500, P = 0.034). In the final regression model, beck hopelessness score emerged as a significant predictor of repeat suicide attempts (odds ratio = 1.064, P = 0.020). Conclusion: Among suicide attempters presenting to the hospital, the presence of hopelessness is a predictor of repeat suicide attempts, independent of clinical depression. This highlights the importance of considering hopelessness in the assessment of suicidality with a view to minimize the risk of future attempts.",2016.0,10.4103/0976-3147.168435,UYK9NDLW,0,diathesis,643
643,Actigraphy and motion analysis: new tools for psychiatry.,"Teicher, M. H.","Altered locomotor activity is a cardinal sign of several psychiatric disorders. With advances in technology, activity can now be measured precisely. Contemporary studies quantifying activity in psychiatric patients are reviewed. Studies were located by a Medline search (1965 to present; English language only) cross-referencing motor activity and major psychiatric disorders. The review focused on mood disorders and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Activity levels are elevated in mania, agitated depression, and ADHD and attenuated in bipolar depression and seasonal depression. The percentage of low-level daytime activity is directly related to severity of depression, and change in this parameter accurately mirrors recovery. Demanding cognitive tasks elicit fidgeting in children with ADHD, and precise measures of activity and attention may provide a sensitive and specific marker for this disorder. Circadian rhythm analysis enhances the sophistication of activity measures. Affective disorders in children and adolescents are characterized by an attenuated circadian rhythm and an enhanced 12-hour harmonic rhythm (diurnal variation). Circadian analysis may help to distinguish between the activity patterns of mania (dysregulated) and ADHD (intact or enhanced). Persistence of hyperactivity or circadian dysregulation in bipolar patients treated with lithium appears to predict rapid relapse once medication is discontinued. Activity monitoring is a valuable research tool, with the potential to aid clinicians in diagnosis and in prediction of treatment response.",1995.0,,PLRCJRA8,0,cognitive,644

645,Male depression in females?,"Moller-Leimkuhler, Anne Maria; Yucel, Mete; Mller-Leimkhler, A. M.; Ycel, M.","Background: Scientific evidence for a male-typed depression ( male depression ) is still limited, but mainly supports this concept with respect to single externalizing symptoms or symptom clusters. In particular, studies on non-clinical populations including males and females are lacking. The present study aims at assessing general well-being, the risk and the symptoms of male depression dependent on biological sex and gender-role orientation on instrumental (masculine) and expressive (feminine) personality traits in an unselected community sample of males and females. Methods: Students (518 males, 500 females) of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Germany, were asked to participate in a stress study and complete the following self-report questionnaires: the WHO-5 Well-being Index [Bech, P., 1998. Quality of Life in the Psychiatric Patient. Mosby-Wolfe, London], the Gotland Scale for Male Depression [Walinder, J., Rutz, W., 2001. Male depression and suicide. International Clinical Psychopharmacology 16 (suppl 2), 21-24] and the German Extended Personal Attribute Questionnaire [Runge, T.E., Frey, D., Gollwitzer, P.M., et al., 1981. Masculine (instrumental) and feminine (expressive) traits. A comparison between students in the United States and West Germany. Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology 12, 142-162]. Results: General well-being of the students was significantly lower compared to population norms. Contrary to expectations, female students had a greater risk of male depression than male students (28.9 \ \% \ vs. 22.4 \ \% \ ; p \ \textless \ 0.05). Overall, prototypic depressive symptoms as well as externalizing symptoms were more pronounced in females. In the subgroup of those at risk for male depression, biological sex and kind of symptoms were unrelated. Principal component analyses revealed a similar symptom structure for males and females. Low scores on masculinity/instrumentality significantly predicted higher risk of male depression, independent of biological sex. Limitations: The study sample is not representative to the general population. Self-reports of the participants were not validated by a clinical evaluation. Conclusions: The results suggest that male depression might also be highly prevalent in females, at least in university students. This can be explained by a growing social acceptance of aggression in women, by a greater exposure to chronic stressors and by a more pronounced stress sensitivity. Particularly female students need special attention and support. Externalizing symptoms should be routinely assessed when diagnosing depression in men and women. \ \textcopyright \ 2009 Elsevier B.V.

METHOD: A total of 80 adolescents (85 \ \% \ female) consecutively presenting to mental health services with self-harm and comorbid depression were randomly allocated to either MBT-A or TAU. Adolescents were assessed for self-harm, risk-taking and mood at baseline and at 3-monthly intervals until 12 months. Their attachment style, mentalization ability and borderline personality disorder (BPD) features were also assessed at baseline and at the end of the 12-month treatment. RESULTS: MBT-A was more effective than TAU in reducing self-harm and depression. This superiority was explained by improved mentalization and reduced attachment avoidance and reflected improvement in emergent BPD symptoms and traits. CONCLUSIONS: MBT-A may be an effective intervention to reduce self-harm in adolescents.",2012.0,10.1016/j.jaac.2012.09.018,HY2XGC8D,0,personality,647

Clinical data assessing the implications of this step on procedural outcomes are limited. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 1164 consecutive TAVR patients in the Israeli multicenter TAVR registry (Sheba, Rabin, and Tel Aviv Medical Centers) between the years 2008 and 2014. Patients were divided to those who underwent balloon pre-dilation (n=1026) versus those who did not (n=138). RESULTS: Rates of balloon pre-dilation decreased from 95% in 2008-2011 to 59% in 2014 (p for trend=0.002). Baseline characteristics between groups were similar except for more smoking (22% vs. 8%, p=0.008), less past CABG (18% vs. 26%, p=0.016), less diabetes mellitus (35% vs. 45%, p=0.01), and lower STS mortality scores (5.2+/-3.7 vs. 6.1+/-3.5, p=0.006) in the pre-dilatation group. The pre-dilation group included less patients with moderate to severely depressed LVEF (7% vs. 16%, p<0.001) and higher aortic peak gradients (76.9+/-22.7mmHg vs. 71.4+/-24.3mmHg, p=0.01). Stroke rates were comparable in both groups (2.5% vs. 3%, p=0.8), but pre-dilation was associated with lower rates of balloon post-dilatation (9% vs. 26%, p<0.001). On multivariate analysis, balloon pre-dilatation was not a predictor of device success or any post-procedural complications (p=0.07). CONCLUSIONS: Balloon pre-dilatation was not associated with procedural adverse events and may decrease the need for balloon post-dilatation. The results of the present study support the current practice to perform liberally balloon pre-dilatation prior to valve implantation.",2017.0,10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.12.062,LYT9QPXB,0,additional,648

Impact of personality traits on the evolution of depressive symptoms, quality of life, and perception of clinical progress was assessed in a psychotherapeutic community. DESIGN: A prospective longitudinal study was conducted in 62 elderly outpatients. SETTING: Day hospital treatment as usual combined group and individual therapies, pharmacological treatment, as well as family and network meetings. PARTICIPANTS: Patients presented with major depression or a depressive episode of bipolar disease. MEASUREMENTS: The Geriatric Depression Scale, the Short Form Survey, and the Therapeutic Community Assessment scale were administrated at admission, 3, 6, 12 months, and at discharge. Personality was evaluated with the NEO Five-Factor Personality Inventory. RESULTS: Outcome revealed reduced depression and improved mental quality of life and clinical progress. Higher Geriatric Depression Scale scores were found in individuals with higher levels of Neuroticism (and its Vulnerability facet). Better self-perception of clinical progress was observed in individuals with lower levels of the Depressiveness and Modesty facets and higher openness to action. Improvement in quality of life was predicted by high Positive emotions facet. All these associations remained significant after controlling for age, gender, and treatment length.

649,The body in psychoanalysis,"Carignani, P.","The author offers a brief introduction to the theories of Armando Ferrari, highlighting his emphasis on the body, not only as mind's first object, but on the object out of which mind originates. He notes that this notion is the heir to Freud's preoccupation with finding the organic foundation of the mind in the body in which it is rooted, and in the idea of the drives as the expression of emergent psychic functions from the body, whereas instinct is the psychical representative of the stimulus originating from within the organism. Drives are not so much corporeal or psychic as defining the connection between the two realms. He suggests that this distinction became blurred with the tendentious translation of Trieb as 'instinct' and, later, as 'emotion', with the connotations of mental phenomena detached from the physical; while furthermore, the object relational stance, particularly as promulgated by Klein, suggested that such instincts could only be related to by the infant and become mind having been projected into the breast and then reintrojected. The infant's relationship with his body is thus mediated by the breast in Klein's model, rather than immediate and direct. Thus, whereas Freud always linked the psychosexual development of the infant directly with the emergence of physical desire arising from the erogenous zones, Klein linked the first fantasies (innate unconscious phantasy) with the infant's relationship with the maternal breast which now becomes the infant's first object, and emphasis is placed upon this object rather than on the subject of perception. Therapeutically, this necessitates that it also be placed on the transference. Bion moved away from this model with his emphasis on the proto-mental in which physical and mental remain undifferentiated, so that distress from it as a source can be expressed in either; and in his idea of beta elements (sensational and affective) which are chronologically anterior to alpha elements and which can be employed for expression where alpha elements do not exist. The author concludes with a section on Ferrari whose bipartite model of mind arising out of body (as opposed to Winnicott's tripartite model which he discusses earlier in the paper) might be expressed in Bion's terms as one in which beta elements contain within themselves thecapacity to become alpha elements, while alpha function arise out of beta. Bion's shift from the object relations model to one based on the relation between sensation and affect on the one hand and mental function on the other entailed a shift away from insistent transference interpretation in favour of confronting the patient with his bodily self, a shift which Ferrari embraced and developed. \textcopyright 2012 BAP and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",2012.0,10/gg4n2n,6IM3IU86,0,psychodynamic,650

METHODS: Multivariate analysis with data from 672 Korean American older adults in Florida explored the mediation model of health perceptions. RESULTS: The presence of diabetes was associated with negative perceptions of health and elevated symptoms of depression. The proposed mediation model was also supported: negative perceptions of health served as an intervening step between diabetes and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The intervening role of health perceptions yields implications for developing health promotion interventions targeting older individuals with diabetes. Results suggest that even in the presence of chronic health conditions, mental well-being of older adults can be maintained by having optimistic beliefs and positive attitudes towards their own health.",2012.0,10.1016/j.diabres.2012.03.018,3ZTFPZWJ,0,cognitive,651

METHOD: Early social functioning and pathological childhood experiences were assessed using the Childhood Experiences Questionnaire-Revised. The responses of 146 adults diagnosed with primary AVPD were compared with a group of 371 patients with other personality disorders as a primary diagnosis and a group of 83 patients with current major depression disorder and no personality disorders, using chi2 analyses. Diagnoses were based on semistructured interviews by trained reliable clinicians. RESULTS: Adults with AVPD reported poorer child and adolescent athletic performance, less involvement in hobbies during adolescence, and less adolescent popularity than the depressed comparison group and the other personality disorder group. Reported rates of physical and emotional abuse were higher than the depressed group, but this result was influenced by comorbid diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that early manifestations of AVPD are present in childhood but that various forms of abuse are not specific to the disorder.",2003.0,10.1097/01.CHI.0000070250.24125.5F,HS7F78JB,0,personality,652

Method: A single blind, individually randomized, pragmatic trial of a depression self-care toolkit (Toolkit) with or without lay telephone coaching was conducted among primary care adults with depressive symptoms and comorbid chronic physical conditions. Eligible patients were randomized to receive the Toolkit with (intervention) or without (control) telephone coaching provided by trained lay coaches. The primary outcome was depression severity [Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)] at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were self-efficacy, satisfaction, and use of health services at 6 months. Results: A total of 223 patients were randomized, and 172 (77.1 \% ) completed 6-month follow-ups. PHQ-9 scores improved significantly in both groups over the 6-month follow-up; the differences in PHQ-9 scores between intervention and control groups were statistically significant at 3 months [effect size = 0.43; 95 \% confidence interval (CI) = 0.15-0.70] but not at 6 months (effect size = 0.23; 95 \% CI = -0.04-0.59). Patients with moderate depression severity (PHQ-9 10-19) and high self-efficacy at baseline were most likely to benefit from the intervention. There was no significant effect of the intervention on the secondary outcomes. Conclusions: The incremental value of lay telephone coaching of a Toolkit appears short-lived. Targeting of coaching to those with moderate depression severity may be indicated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",2015.0,,XYMJWJ94,0,behavior,653
653,Infants' affective responses in the strange situation: effects of prematurity and of quality of attachment.,"Frodi, A.; Thompson, R.","20 full-term and 20 preterm infants and their mothers were videotaped in the Strange Situation, and the security of their attachment relationships was later determined. Each episode was subsequently divided into consecutive 15-sec intervals, during each of which ratings of facial expressions were performed. From these ratings several summary dimensions of affect were derived (e.g., affective peak and range during all episodes, latency and rise time for onset of distress during separation episodes, and recovery time during reunions). Term and preterm infants did not differ from one another in either the security of attachment or their affective expression and regulation. When groups were combined, patterns of affective expression were significantly different for infants classified as insecure-avoidant, insecure-ambivalent, and securely attached, as well as for group B1 + B2 infants compared to group B3 + B4 babies. The findings indicated that attachment-related affect may reflect an affect continuum that underlies certain mother- and stranger-directed behaviors in the Strange Situation, but that not all aspects of reunion behavior can be predicted by prior separation reactions.",1985.0,,RIB26WIN,0,cognitive_additional,654

In 2011, there were an estimated 325,000 survivors of childhood cancer in the United States (Buchbinder et al., 2011). This number continues to grow. Yet, the medical late-effects and psychological and social vulnerabilities related to the illness often continue. This chronic illness, including the diagnosis, treatment, and recurrence are potentially traumatic to the patient and his family members (Kazak et al., 2006). Therefore, the author reviewed the literature through an in-depth assessment of the medical late-effects and psychological sequealea as well as treatment options available to survivors of pediatric cancer. Attachment theory was the theoretical base for which to understand the psychological concerns of the disease. The author developed two research questions to guide the critical review including: (a) What factors of attachment are at play as a family navigates pediatric cancer survivorship, a highly variable process that can contribute to psychological maladjustment and distress, including anxiety, hopelessness, fear of pain, death and dying, depression, and the like? Specifically, are internal working models of attachment changed or altered as a result of the diagnosis or treatment of pediatric cancer, a potentially traumatic event (PTE)? (b) Do attachment-based interventions promoting secure familial attachments have positive implications for the patient's and family's ability to manage the psychological stressors and emotional challenges as a result of the longer-term consequences of pediatric cancer? Outcomes of the review suggest that each person in the family has his or her own experience and reaction to the disease. Often, the concerns of the patient are very different than a caregiver's. However, caregiver responses significantly impact the functioning of the family system. Greater attachment security was associated with greater psychological functioning.

As hypothesized, adolescents who reported their parents to be consistently supportive (e.g. supportive for at least two points in time) had lower levels of depression and delinquency higher levels of self-efficacy and did better in school over the 3-year period than adolescents who reported their parents to be inconsistently supportive (e.g. supportive at only one time point or less). The results showed that there were no significant interactions between region and supportive parenting, indicating that the effects of consistently supportive parenting 'worked' in a similar manner in both contexts of former East and West Germany.

664,Serotonin neuronal function and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment in anorexia and bulimia nervosa.,"Kaye, W.; Gendall, K.; Strober, M.","Anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) are disorders characterized by aberrant patterns of feeding behavior and weight regulation, and disturbances in attitudes toward weight and shape and the perception of body shape. Emerging data support the possibility that substantial biologic and genetic vulnerabilities contribute to the pathogenesis of AN and BN. Multiple neuroendocrine and neurotransmitter abnormalities have been documented in AN and BN, but for the most part, these disturbances are state-related and tend to normalize after symptom remission and weight restoration; however, elevated concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid after recovery suggest that altered serotonin activity in AN and BN is a trait-related characteristic. Elevated serotonin activity is consistent with behaviors found after recovery from AN and BN, such as obsessionality with symmetry and exactness, harm avoidance, perfectionism, and behavioral over control. In BN, serotonergic modulating antidepressant medications suppress symptoms independently of their antidepressant effects. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are not useful when AN subjects are malnourished and under-weight; however, when given after weight restoration, fluoxetine may significantly reduce the extremely high rate of relapse normally seen in AN. Nonresponse to SSRI medication in ill AN subjects could be a consequence of an inadequate supply of nutrients, which are essential to normal serotonin synthesis and function. These data raise the possibility that a disturbance of serotonin activity may create a vulnerability for the expression of a cluster of symptoms that are common to both AN and BN and that nutritional factors may affect SSRI response in depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or other conditions characterized by disturbances in serotonergic pathways.",1998.0,,NVTCALNT,0,cognitive,665

L.; Pickles, A.; Simonoff, E.; Maes, H. H.; Silberg, J. L.; Hewitt, J. K.; Eaves, L. J.","In this report we characterize associations between parental psychiatric disorders and children's psychiatric symptoms and disorders using a population-based sample of 850 twin families. Juvenile twins are aged 8-17 years and are personally interviewed about their current history of DSM-III-R conduct, depression, oppositional-defiant, overanxious, and separation anxiety disorders using the CAPA-C. Mothers and fathers of twins are personally interviewed about their lifetime history of DSM-III-R alcoholism, antisocial personality disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, major depression, panic disorder/agoraphobia, social phobia, and simple phobia using a modified version of the SCID and the DIS. Generalized least squares and logistic regression are used to identify the juvenile symptoms and disorders that are significantly associated with parental psychiatric histories. The specificity of these associations is subsequently explored in a subset of families with maternal plus parental psychiatric histories with a prevalence \ \textgreater \ 1 \ \% \ . Parental depression that is not comorbid or associated with a different spousal disorder is associated with a significantly elevated level of depression and overanxious disorder symptoms and a significantly increased risk for overanxious disorder. Risks are higher for both symptomatic domains in association with maternal than paternal depression, and highest in association with maternal plus paternal depression. Risks for otherjuvenile symptoms and disorders index the comorbid and spousal histories with which parental depression is commonly associated.

667,Stathmin reduction and cytoskeleton rearrangement in rat nucleus accumbens in response to clozapine and risperidone treatment - Comparative proteomic study.,"Kedracka-Krok, S.; Swiderska, B.; Jankowska, U.; Skupien-Rabian, B.; Solich, J.; Dziedzicka-Wasylewska, M.","The complex network of anatomical connections of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) makes it an interface responsible for the selection and integration of cognitive and affective information to modulate appetitive or aversively motivated behaviour. There is evidence for NAc dysfunction in schizophrenia. NAc also seems to be important for antipsychotic drug action, but the biochemical characteristics of drug-induced alterations within NAc remain incompletely characterized. In this study, a comprehensive proteomic analysis was performed to describe the differences in the mechanisms of action of clozapine (CLO) and risperidone (RIS) in the rat NAc. Both antipsychotics influenced the level of microtubule-regulating proteins, i.e., stathmin, and proteins of the collapsin response mediator protein family (CRMPs), and only CLO affected NAD-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin-2 and septin 6. Both antipsychotics induced changes in levels of other cytoskeleton-related proteins. CLO exclusively up-regulated proteins involved in neuroprotection, such as glutathione synthetase, heat-shock 70-kDa protein 8 and mitochondrial heat-shock protein 75. RIS tuned cell function by changing the pattern of post-translational modifications of some proteins: it down-regulated the phosphorylated forms of stathmin and dopamine and the cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP-32) isoform but up-regulated cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5). RIS modulated the level and phosphorylation state of synaptic proteins: synapsin-2, synaptotagmin-1 and adaptor-related protein-2 (AP-2) complex.",2016.0,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2015.12.028,T5NLEMYC,0,cognitive,668

669,Adverse childhood experiences worsen cognitive distortion during adult bipolar depression.,"Poletti, Sara; Colombo, Cristina; Benedetti, Francesco","BACKGROUND: Cognitive distortion is a central feature of depression, encompassing negative thinking, dysfunctional personality styles and dysfunctional attitudes. It has been hypothesized that ACEs could increase the vulnerability to depression by contributing to the development of a stable negative cognitive style. Nevertheless, little research has been carried out on possible associations between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and cognitive distortion, and whether any gender differences exist. AIM: The aim of this study was to examine the association between ACEs and cognitive distortions and possible differences between genders in a sample of patients affected by bipolar disorder. METHOD: 130 patients with bipolar disorder (BD) (46 men and 84 females), completed the Risky Family Questionnaire to assess ACEs and the Cognition Questionnaire (CQ) to assess cognitive distortions. RESULTS: A positive association was found between ACE and the CQ total score. Investigating the 5 dimensions assessed through the CQ, only the dimension generalization across situations was significantly associated to ACE. An interaction between ACE and gender was found for generalization across situations , while no differential effect among females and males was found for CQ total score. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to report a relationship between negative past experiences and depressive cognitive distortions in subjects affected by BD. Growing in a family environment affected by harsh parenting seems to a cognitive vulnerability to depression; this effect is especially strong in females.",2014.0,10.1016/j.comppsych.2014.07.013,RJB5HPD5,0,personality,670

J.","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with psychiatric illness, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and completed suicide. We investigated the relationship between mild TBI and other risk factors for suicidal behavior in major depressive episode. We hypothesized that mild TBI would be associated with suicidal behavior at least partly because of shared risk factors that contribute to the diathesis for suicidal acts. Depressed patients (N = 325) presenting for treatment were evaluated for psychopathology, traumatic history, and suicidal behavior. Data were analyzed using Student t -test, chi-square statistic, or Fisher exact test. A backward stepwise logistic regression model (N = 255) examined the relationship between attempter status and variables that differed in the TBI and non-TBI patients. Forty-four percent of all subjects reported mild TBI. Subjects with TBI were more likely to be male, have a history of substance abuse, have cluster B personality disorder, and be more aggressive and hostile compared with subjects without TBI. They were also more likely to be suicide attempters, although their suicidal behavior was not different from that of suicide attempters without TBI. Attempt status was mostly predicted by aggression and hostility, but not the presence of TBI. Of note, for males, a history of TBI increased the likelihood of being a suicide attempter, whereas the risk was elevated for females regardless of TBI history. Our data suggest that suicidal behavior and TBI share antecedent risk factors: hostility and aggression. Future studies may yield confirmation using a prospective design.",2004.0,10.1097/01.nmd.0000126706.53615.7b,Z946ITUZ,0,personality,671

Subjects were given 150 mg of amitriptyline daily and the treatment response was determined on day 11 and 21. The duration of hospitalization served as a further criterion of outcome. The data suggest that neither diagnostic sub-typing nor neuroendocrinological variables were significantly related to outcome.

The following report is about the case of a patient with a traumatic childhood, who engaged in erotogenic masochistic behavior and intermittent depression combined with moral masochism. The evolution of the case shows that whenever the patient was threatened by separation anxiety he resorted to erotogenic masochism so as to handle the trauma of separation and maintain his self integrity. On the other hand, when severe exogenous traumatic events such as actual loss of a significant other occurred, caused the erotogenic masochism to fail as a defense, the patient regressed to an immobilized narcissistic state, characterized by severe depressive symptomatology with moral masochistic elements. It was as if his catatonic form of reaction enabled him to achieve a symbiotic union with his internal objects and prevent further psychotic disorganization.",1997.0,10/fn25dx,9X7QAGSQ,0,psychodynamic,674
674,Emotion in self-criticism.,"Whelton, William Joseph","A sample of college students was selected using the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire and these students were videotaped criticizing themselves and responding to the criticism after an imagination exercise which recalled an experience of failure. Observer codings showed that Self-Critics displayed more contempt for self in their self-criticism than did Controls. Self-Critics displayed less self-resilience than Controls in response to the criticism: They were less assertive, more submissive and more sad and ashamed than Controls. Self-Critics benefited from a Process-Experiential or Cognitive-Behavioral intervention, though neither type of intervention proved more effective than the other. The Process-Experiential two-chair intervention was not helpful to the Dependent subsample of the Control group. These results support the importance of emotion as well as negative cognition in the genesis of depressive states, particularly the emotions of contempt and disgust for the self. Furthermore, these findings suggest the need for a model of depressive vulnerability which more adequately accounts for emotional processes and which can account for self-resilience in the generation of vulnerable or invulnerable self-states.

675,Prevalence of symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder in German professional firefighters,"Wagner, D.; Heinrichs, M.; Ehlert, U.","Objective: This study investigated the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and comorbid symptoms among professional firefighters in Germany and examined not only primary but also secondary traumatic stress disorder experienced by these firefighters who were exposed to the sufferings of others. Method: To estimate the prevalence of trauma-related disorders, a representative group of 402 professional firefighters from the State of Rheinland-Pfalz in Germany was surveyed through use of the General Health Questionnaire, a PTSD Symptom Scale, a stress coping questionnaire, and a self-rating scale to assess bodily complaints. Results: The current prevalence rate of PTSD symptoms among professional firefighters was 18.2 \% . About 27 \% of the recruited subjects had a mental disorder according to the General Health Questionnaire. Predictors for the extent of traumatic stress were longer job experience and the number of distressing missions during the last month. Traumatic stress also predicted psychiatric impairment beyond PTSD, such as depressive mood, psychosomatic complaints, Social dysfunction, and substance abuse. Conclusions: The high prevalence of PTSD and other psychiatric impairments in firefighters indicates that they often fail to cope with primary and particularly secondary stress in their daily work. This problem, together with the individual psychological consequences and expenses related to work absenteeism and early retirement, seems to be very specific for the profession of firefighters. The present findings provide a better understanding of the relationship between secondary traumatic stress and PTSD in professional helpers and high-risk populations such as firefighters, emergency workers, and the police.",1998.0,,HJJMQVF8,0,diathesis,676

METHODS: Female university students (n = 314) with a mean age of 19 (SD = 1.18) were included in the research. The mean body mass index (BMI) of participants was 20.77 (SD = 2.77, range = 15.57-33.06). Participants completed a demographics questionnaire, the Autonomy-Relatedness Scales, Eating Attitudes Test, Body Cathexis Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory. RESULTS: Lower autonomy-relatedness (beta = -0.13, p \textless 0.05) predicted more problematic eating attitudes, but autonomy-relatedness itself was not a significant predictor of body satisfaction in young females. Ideal weight scores (beta = -0.19, p \textless 0.01) negatively predicted a disturbance in eating attitudes, whereas depression scores (beta = 0.12, p \textless 0.05) positively predicted a disturbance. Although none of the self-constructs (autonomy, relatedness, autonomy-relatedness) were significant predictors of body satisfaction, BMI (beta = -0.20, p \textless 0.001), and depressive symptoms (beta = -0.28, p \textless 0.001) negatively predicted body satisfaction, whereas ideal weight scores (beta = 0.14, p \textless 0.01) positively predicted body satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: The Autonomous-Related Self was a meaningful measure of associations between the self and eating psychopathology, but not of the relationship between the self and body satisfaction. It was also important to evaluate objective (e.g., BMI) and subjective (e.g., ideal weight) indicators of weight to better understand the nature of eating patterns and body satisfaction.

681,A Meta-Analytic Review of the Penn Resiliency Program's Effect on Depressive Symptoms,"Brunwasser, S. M.; Gillham, J. E.; Kim, E. S.","The purpose of this review was to evaluate whether the Penn Resiliency Program (PRP), a group cognitive-behavioral intervention, is effective in targeting depressive symptoms in youths. We identified 17 controlled evaluations of PRP (N = 2,498) in which depressive symptoms had been measured via an online search of PsycInfo, Medline, ERIC, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses and by requesting data from PRP researchers. We combined effect sizes (ESs; Glass's d), using random effects models at postintervention and two follow-up assessments (6-8 and 12 months postintervention). PRP participants reported fewer depressive symptoms at postintervention and both follow-up assessments compared with youths receiving no intervention, with ESs ranging from 0.11 to 0.21. Subgroup analyses showed that PRP's effects were significant at 1 or more follow-up assessments among studies with both targeted and universal approaches, when group leaders were research team members and community providers, among participants with both low and elevated baseline symptoms, and among boys and girls. Limited data showed no evidence that PRP is superior to active control conditions. Preliminary analyses suggested that PRP's effects on depressive disorders may be smaller than those reported in a larger meta-analysis of depression prevention programs for older adolescents and adults. We found evidence that PRP significantly reduces depressive symptoms through at least 1-year postintervention. Future PRP research should examine whether PRP's effects on depressive symptoms lead to clinically meaningful benefits for its participants, whether the program is cost-effective, whether CB skills mediate program effects, and whether PRP is effective when delivered under real-world conditions. \ \textcopyright \ 2009 American Psychological Association.",2009.0,,8I4Z496M,0,behavior,682

Design: Longitudinal data collected in the course of an uncontrolled evaluation of a large-scale CBT-I training program. Setting: Outpatient and residential treatment facilities. Participants: Four hundred five Veterans presenting for treatment of insomnia. Interventions: Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. Measurement and Results: At baseline, 32 \ \% \ of patients, compared with 21 \ \% \ at final assessment, endorsed some level of suicidal ideation [chi2(df = 1) = 125; P \ \textless \ 0.001]. After adjusting for demographic variables and baseline insomnia severity, each 7-point decrease in Insomnia Severity Index score achieved during CBT-I treatment was associated with a 65 \ \% \ (odds ratio = 0.35; 95 \ \% \ confidence intervals = 0.24 to 0.52) reduction in odds of suicidal ideation. The effect of change in insomnia severity on change in depression severity was also significant. After controlling for change in depression severity and other variables in the model, the effect of change in insomnia severity on change in suicidal ideation remained significant. Conclusion: This evaluation of the largest dissemination of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in the United States found a clinically meaningful reduction in suicidal ideation among Veterans receiving CBT-I. The mechanisms by which effective treatment of insomnia with CBT-I reduces suicide risk are unknown and warrant investigation. The current results may have significant public health implications for preventing suicide among Veterans. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",,,INVMCK8I,0,behavior,683

The case history is followed by an existential analysis, a psychoanalysis, and a psychopathological clinical analysis of Ellen West. The author designates the case of Ellen West as schizophrenia. It may to some colleagues seem striking, even devious, that the author begins an attempt to elucidate from the anthropological side the problem of schizophrenia with a case which shows no intellectual defect, no secondary schizophrenic symptoms such as delusion and hallucinations, blocking or stereotypy, and which exhibits a multitude of apparently nonschizophrenic features, in addition to showing a predominantly manic-depressive heredity. The author counters these objections with the statement that precisely in this case we were able to trace and display step by step, through the tangle and vagueness of the symptomatology, the progressive narrowing, loss of power, and mundanizing, (Verweltlichung) or, psychopathologically expressed, the emptying of the personality as observed in the schizophrenic process.

The primary alcohol metabolite was not found in measurable amounts. The terminal half-lives for excretion of all metabolites were in the range of 4-6 hr, were independent of dose, and were limited by their rates of formation. A prolonged time course of excretion of the metabolites, particularly at higher doses, suggests that probenecid, being poorly soluble in water, precipitates from solution in the GI tract, forming a depot of drug from which absorption is dissolution rate limited. The urinary excretion of unchanged probenecid, which accounts for 4-13% of the dose, is dependent on both the pH and flow rate of urine.",2009.0,10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2009.144,6766AXED,0,behavior,685
685,Research on outcomes of psychoanalysis and psychoanalysis-derived psychotherapies.,"Sandell, Rolf","Researchers have found it difficult to comply entirely with modern methodological standards when studying the outcomes of the very long processes in psychoanalysis. The major shortcomings have been in specifying the treatment given, in specifying its patients, and in controlling for confounding factors, such as selection bias for instance, through randomization. Where short-term psychodynamic psychotherapies are concerned, researchers are becoming more compliant with the standards and have been able to publish empirical support for their positive effects, especially with depressed patients. Moderate-length and long-term psychodynamic psychotherapies are less well supported, but research suggests they may be uniquely effective for patients with complex and long-standing personality-based problems or disorders. Psychoanalysis proper has been tested in various designs, which were typically not well controlled. Studies suggest that psychoanalysis may generate results superior to those of psychodynamic psychotherapy, but to what extent this is due to mere treatment intensity or duration is not clear. Symptoms and focused problems tend to change more than relations and personality-based problems in response to treatment, and the treatment results tend to improve during follow-up.

We hypothesized that exposure to traumatic stressors and current diagnosis of PTSD would be more common in women with schizophrenia and SUD, when compared to the other two groups. Results indicate that women with schizophrenia and SUD had a more extensive trauma history than women with SUD only, and were also more likely to have PTSD. Women with schizophrenia had a fourfold greater likelihood of meeting criteria for current PTSD than were women with severe, nonpsychotic depression when potential confounds of age, race, education, severity of trauma history, and childhood trauma exposure were controlled. These results lend support to the possibility that women with psychosis have an elevated vulnerability to PTSD symptomology when exposed to life stressors that is distinct from the vulnerability associated with coexisting nonpsychotic SMI.

Logistic regression identified variables associated with acceptability of and initiation and engagement in telepsychotherapy. RESULTS: To 76 \% of patients the idea of participating in psychotherapy was acceptable. Thirty-eight percent scheduled a telepsychotherapy session, 17 \% attended a session, and 8 \% engaged in treatment (attended at least eight sessions). Because the intervention was designed to minimize barriers, access was not a significant predictor of utilization. However, use of telepsychotherapy was associated with measures of perceived need.

Self-reported use of cocaine was highly predictive of use of many other drug substances. Intent to use cocaine is associated with several personality traits. With one exception, measures of psychopathology were not predictive of, nor influenced by, cocaine use over a 1-year period.

This study examined the mediating role of relationship-specific attachment (avoidance and anxiety) in the associations between childhood adversity and both psychological distress and subjective well-being. University students (N =190) across the Republic of Ireland completed self-report measures including the Adverse Childhood Experiences scale, Experiences in Close Relationships-Relationship Structures scale, Depression Anxiety and Stress scales and measures of subjective well-being. One hundred and twenty-eight participants (67.4%) reported experiencing at least one adverse childhood experience. Childhood adversity was associated with symptoms of psychological distress and subjective well-being. All such associations were mediated by certain relationship-specific attachment dimensions. Of these, attachment anxiety in general relationships was the most prominent mediator for both psychological distress and subjective well-being. Attachment to one's father and to one's romantic partner did not mediate any association. These findings indicate that attachment, in particular relationships, is an important factor in the associations between childhood adversity and both psychological distress and subjective well-being as an adult. One's attachment anxiety in general relationships is particularly important in these associations. Therapeutic interventions addressing these attachment domains may offset the detrimental effects of childhood adversity. Future research is required using a longitudinal design.

In particular, the relationship between subjective life satisfaction and objective measures of psychosocial adjustment has not been well-studied. The goal of the present study was to examine the longitudinal associations between subjective life satisfaction and objective functional outcome among individuals with bipolar and unipolar mood disorders. METHOD: One hundred fifty-seven mood disordered subjects were assessed at index hospitalization for bipolar mania (n=35), unipolar psychotic depression (n=27), or unipolar nonpsychotic depression (n=95). All were prospectively followed up three times, at approximately 2, 4.5 and 7-8 years. Global outcome, work performance, social adjustment, recurrent depressive episodes, and dimensions of life satisfaction were assessed by semi-structured interviews using standardized ratings. RESULTS: Subjective life satisfaction strongly paralleled global functioning, work performance and social adjustment at each follow-up for patients with unipolar nonpsychotic depression, but not bipolar disorder or unipolar psychotic depression. Depressive symptoms and objective functional impairment contributed to poor QOL in most domains, independent of illness chronicity, medication use, or affective disorder subtype. LIMITATIONS: Findings might have differed had a different QOL measure been used, although the present measure showed concurrent validity with a previously used instrument. Sample sizes for the bipolar and psychotic depression groups were sufficient to detect moderate, but not small, correlations between objective functioning and subjective QOL. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent depression remains a substantial contributor to poor life satisfaction across affective disorder subtypes. Subjective QOL in bipolar and unipolar psychotic depression patients may not accurately reflect objective functional outcome status, potentially due to diminished insight, demoralization, or altered life expectations over time.",2005.0,10.1016/j.jad.2005.08.008,45M5G8JJ,0,cognitive_additional,694

695,A longtitudinal study of brain atrophy and cognitive disturbances in the early phase of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.,"Zivadinov, R.; Sepcic, J.; Nasuelli, D. and","Examined whether the cognitive decline of the early phase of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) depends on the progression of the burden of disease, or on the loss of brain parenchyma, or is influenced by both; monitored the loss of brain parenchyma in the early phase of the disease; and examined its possible relation with the progression of physical disability. For 2 yrs 53 patients (aged 18-60 yrs) with clinically definite RRMS with disease duration 1-5 yrs and expanded disability status scale 5.0 at baseline were monitored. The neuropsychological performances, the psychological functioning, and neurological impairment were assessed. The relation between cognitive impairment and MRI findings has been investigated by partial correlation and stepwise multiple regression analyses excluding effects of age, education, anxiety, depression, and total days of steroid use. 14 Ss were judged to be cognitively impaired at baseline and 28 at the end of the followup. Of the 18 neuropsychological tests and subtests employed in the study, Ss with multiple sclerosis failed 5.8 tests at the baseline and 8.4 tests at the end of the study. When cognitive changes were examined in Ss, 5 of them were considered cognitively improved, 33 remained stable, and 15 worsened over 2 yrs.

696,Pathways to anaclitic and introjective depression.,"Reis, Samantha; Grenyer, Brin F. S.","Depression may be conceptualized multidimensionally, owing to marked individual differences in developmental vulnerability and phenomenology. Blatt (Blatt, Quinlan, Chevran, McDonald, Zuroff, 1982; Blatt, Quinlan, Pilkonis, \& Shea, 1995) has validated two subtypes of depression. Anaclitic depression involves excessive interpersonal concerns, including feelings of loneliness, weakness, helplessness and abandonment fears. Introjective depression denotes achievement concerns, and is characterized by a tendency towards self-criticism and self-evaluation. Present research examined this distinction by identifying possible differential attachment patterns for the depression subtypes. It was hypothesized that, while secure attachment would negatively relate to depression, insecure attachment would predict anaclitic and introjective subtypes, with perfectionism mediating this relationship. A sample of 245 participants completed the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Multidimensional Perfectionism Questionnaire, and two measures of attachment. Regressional techniques revealed that anaclitic depression was predicted by preoccupied attachment (seeking others' acceptance to bolster low self-worth), with socially prescribed perfectionism (striving to meet the high standards of others) partially mediating the relationship. Introjective depression was predicted by fearful-avoidant attachment (low self-worth and expectations of rejection), with self-oriented perfectionism (self-imposed unrealistic standards) acting as a partial mediator. Findings further validate these depressive subtypes by indicating their different attachment-perfectionism paths. Results are concordant with attachment theory and have implications for both theory and therapy.",2002.0,10.1348/147608302321151934,4ZBQ2TWY,0,cognitive,697
697,Is cognitive-behavioural therapy more effective than psychoeducation in bipolar disorder?,"Zaretsky, Ari; Lancee, William; Miller, Cheryl; Harris, Andrea; Parikh, Sagar V.","Objective: Psychosocial research in bipolar disorder (BD) has not yet assessed the relative benefits of a short course of psychoeducation (PE), compared with a longer course of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) containing psychoeducational principles. This pilot study evaluated the efficacy and added benefit of adding a course of CBT to a standard course of brief PE, as maintenance therapy for BD. Method: Seventy-nine consenting adult men and women with BD on stable medication regimens, who were in full or partial remission from an index episode (BD I = 52; BD II = 27), were randomized to receive either 7 sessions of individual PE, or 7 sessions of PE followed by 13 additional individual sessions of CBT. Weekly mood and medication adherence was rated using the National Institute of Mental Health's Life Chart Method, while psychosocial functioning and mental health use were assessed monthly. Results: Forty-six participants completed the entire study. Participants who received CBT in addition to PE experienced 50 \% fewer days of depressed mood over the course of one year. Participants who received PE alone had more antidepressant increases compared with those who received CBT. There were no group differences in hospitalization rates, medication adherence, psychosocial functioning, or mental health use. Conclusions: Pilot data from this real-world study suggest that even after medication treatment has been optimized, a longer course of adjunctive CBT may offer some additional benefits over a shorter course of PE alone for the maintenance treatment of BD. Larger randomized controlled trials with equal treatment lengths are indicated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",,,MVQ2BCX6,0,behavior,698

Five patients developed severe neurological abnormalities within 48 hours of addmission (convulsions 2, convulsions with hemiplegia 2, hemiplegia 1). Of these, 3 had residual defects on follow-up at least one year later. This group was indistinguishable from the 11 without significant neurological abnormality, both on clinical grounds before rehydration, and after analysis of admission and subsequent serum biochemical variables. A significant osmolar gap (greater than 4 mmol/kg H2O) between serum and CSF was found in 13 patients. Severe neurological disturbance only occurred when CSF osmolality exceeded that of serum by 7 or more mmol/kg H2O. Discriminant analysis of the paired osmolar data showed that D = -117+1-74 X(CSF osmolality) -1-41 X (serum osmolality), and that severe neurological abnormality was predicted when D was positive.",2006.0,10.1016/j.biopsych.2005.08.022,23FVZDKL,0,personality,699
699,Positive interventions in cognitive-behavioural psychotherapy.,"Paschalia, Mitskidou; Ioannis, Vlontakis","Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is a well-established, evidence-based psychotherapy. Although it is the therapy of choice for both depression and anxiety disorders, many patients remain symptomatic after termination of their treatment, while relapses are not uncommon in the long-term follow-ups. Over time, different techniques have been proposed in order to enrich cognitive-behavioural psychotherapy and increase its effectiveness. From the field of Positive Psychology, three psychotherapeutic strategies, Well-Being Therapy, Hope Therapy and Quality of Life Therapy, have been applied as additional ingredients in cognitive-behavioral packages. They are applied either as relapse prevention or as therapeutic strategies, in patients with affective and anxiety disorders who failed to respond to standard psychotherapeutic treatments. This paper presents the clinical and conceptual framework, as well as the structure and application of each strategy. Their potential clinical usefulness and results of preliminary validation studies are presented. Finally, their contribution in enriching the effectiveness of CBT is discussed.

C.","OBJECTIVES: Cognitive impairment is common in multiple sclerosis (MS) and can have serious impact on social and occupational functioning. Natalizumab reduces relapse rates, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions, and progression of disability. Previous studies on cognitive functioning have not based inclusion on cognitive performance criteria. The aim of the present study was to determine any potential natalizumab-related cognitive effects on MS patients performing below normal limits on neuropsychological testing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients starting natalizumab (n = 21) and a quasi-control group of stable MS patients (n = 13) on first line disease modifying treatment were included following neuropsychological assessment demonstrating subnormal cognitive performance. Assessment, using ten cognitive variables, was repeated after 12 months. Symptoms of fatigue, anxiety and depression were also examined. Raw scores on the cognitive tests were transformed into Z-scores based on published age-corrected normative data. RESULTS: Between-group analyses on difference Z-scores (baseline - follow-up) yielded significant results on Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test-2 (PASAT-2) (P = .008), with the natalizumab group showing larger improvement than quasi control patients. On PASAT-2, 28,5% from the natalizumab group demonstrated >1 SD improvement, indicative of clinically meaningful change, compared with none in the quasi control group. Patients receiving natalizumab showed within-group improvements on six of the ten cognitive variables. There were no group differences in symptoms of fatigue, anxiety or depression. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate improvement in information processing speed following 12-months of natalizumab treatment. The results are interpreted as reflection of anti-inflammatory properties of natalizumab rather than retest- or long-term restorative effects.",2018.0,10/gb2htg,VRNN2QIE,0,additional,702
702,Review of On aggression and violence: An analytic perspective.,"Campbell, Colin","Reviews the book, On aggression and violence: An analytic perspective by R. Mizen and M. Morris (2007). This book has a number of strengths, not least of which is its extensive and highly effective use of clinical material to illustrate fairly complex theoretical points. The authors also acknowledge and address a number of common criticisms of psychoanalytic approaches to aggression and violence, including the tendency to shoehorn emerging ideas into existing theoretical models in order to preserve the integrity of the latter and the failure to integrate psychoanalytic approaches with other models of aggression and violence. One minor gripe relates to this latter point. Although very welcome, the authors' reference to the neuroscience literature is somewhat limited and idiosyncratic. This is a pity, as broader reference to the affective neuroscience, and even behavioural genetics, literature would have enriched many of their arguments and possibly uncovered further opportunities for novel theoretical integration. Authors' have achieved an excellent balance between accessibility, clinical relevance, and rigorous theoretical discussion to produce a book which will be of relevance both to psychoanalysts working with aggressive or violent patients and to forensic mental health professionals for whom such an approach is less central to, but which may nevertheless enhance, their clinical practice.

The kinetics of the heterologous recombination reaction of alkylated H chains of a myeloma protein (Jo) with alkylated L chains of another myeloma protein (Ita) were studied by following changes with time in the circular dichroism at 235 nm and the results were compared with those for the autologous recombination of Jo-H chains with Jo-H chains reported previously (T. Azuma et al.(1975) J. Biochem. 77, 473-479 and the preceding paper). The heterologous reaction also followed second-order kinetics. The second-order rate constant (kapp) for heterologous recombination was about seven times smaller than that for autologous recombination at pH 5.5, while they were similar between pH 4.2 and 4.7. 2. The apparent association constants (Kapp) for the reaction, H2+L2=H2L2, were determined by measuring the ellipticities at 235 nm of mixtures of H and L chains in various ratios. The values of Kapp for the autologous and heterologous recombinations were both pH-dependent and changed from 10(6) M-1 at pH 3.9 to 108 M-1 at pH 4.3. Using these values of kapp and Kapp, the half-time for the dissociation of autologous H2L2 to H2 and L2 at pH 4.3 was estimated to be 80 hr.",2006.0,10.1016/j.jpain.2005.10.011,PEJZIK56,0,behavior,704
704,Longitudinal cohort study describing persistent frequent attenders in Australian primary healthcare.,"Pymont, Carly; Butterworth, Peter","OBJECTIVES: To describe patterns of frequent attendance in Australian primary care, and identify the prospective risk factors for persistent frequent attendance. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This study draws on data from the Personality and Total Health (PATH) Through Life Project, a representative community cohort study of residents from the Canberra region of Australia. Participants were assessed on 3 occasions over 8 years. The survey assessed respondents' experience of chronic physical conditions, self-reported health, symptoms of common mental disorders, personality, life events, sociodemographic characteristics and self-reported medication use. A balanced sample was used in analysis, comprising 1734 respondents with 3 waves of data. The survey data for each respondent were individually linked to their administrative health service use data which were used to generate an objective measure of general practitioner (GP) consultations in the 12 months surrounding their interview date. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Respondents in the (approximate) highest decile of attenders on number of GP consultations over a 12-month period at each time point were defined as frequent attenders (FAs). RESULTS: Baseline FAs (8.4 \ \% \ ) were responsible for 33.4 \ \% \ of baseline consultations, while persistent FAs (3.6 \ \% \ ) for 15.5 \ \% \ of all consultations over the 3 occasions. While there was considerable movement between FA status over time, consistency was greater than expected by chance alone. While there were many factors that differentiated non-FAs from FAs in general, persistent frequent attendance was specifically associated with gender, baseline reports of depression, self-reported physical conditions and disability, and medication use. CONCLUSIONS: The degree of persistence in GP consultations was limited. The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of the risk factors that predict subsequent persistent frequent attendance in primary care. However, further detailed investigation of longitudinal patterns of frequent attendance and consideration of time-varying determinants of frequent attendance is required.",2015.0,10.1136/bmjopen-2015-008975,F3E4GNS7,0,personality,705

We searched for anxiety and depression and their clinical outcomes among patients and searched whether the results are similar to previous studies. Patients and methods: Eighty-seven RLS patients and 88 age, gender, and educationally matched healthy controls were assessed in Bezmialem Foundation University Hospital. RLS patients and healthy controls were assessed with the Sociodemographic Data Form constructed for the present study, 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Beck Anxiety Scale (BAS). The patient group was also assessed with the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) RLS Severity Scale. Results: RLS patients were found to have greater TAS-20, BDI, and BAS scores compared with the control group (P < 0.05). RLS severity score was positively correlated with the scores of anxiety and depression scales. However, no significant relationship was found between scores of IRLSSG RLS scale and TAS-20 total and subscale scores. Conclusion: RLS patients were found to be more alexithymic than healthy controls, whereas no significant relationship was found between RLS severity and levels of alexithymia. Still, alexithymia might be a predictor for early diagnosis and may be considered in the treatment and follow-up of RLS. RLS patients have higher depression and anxiety scores than healthy individuals. Thus, depression and anxiety should be taken into consideration throughout the RLS treatment.",2018.0,10/gd625j,D33QMPW3,0,additional,706
706,Cutting helps me feel better: Nonsuicidal self-injury.,"Nock, Matthew K.; Deliberto, Tara L.","This chapter is a case study of nonsuicidal self-injury. After the case presentation the chapter continues with three commentaries. The first commentary (Psychotherapeutic Perspective, by Alec L. Miller and Dena A. Klein) states that outpatient psychosocial interventions that directly target suicidal behavior and nonsuicidal self injury (NSSI) are considered more effective than other interventions in reducing suicide risk and associated behaviors (Lieb et al. 2004). The second commentary (Psychopharmacologic Perspective, by Niranjan S. Karnik and Hans Steiner) states that The first step in treatment should be to recognize that the client needs an integrated and multimodal strategy (Steiner 2004; Watanabe et al. 2007; Weissman 2007). Results from the Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study support the use of medication and psychotherapy (March et al. 2006). This combined therapy is especially important because most pharmacologic interventions require several weeks to have full effect, whereas psychotherapeutic strategies are more likely to provide immediate structure and support. Given that the client has already presented in the emergency room and that her patterns seem to be slowly escalating, we would be concerned that she may be on a path that may soon move toward true suicidal behavior. (Due to space limitations, we refer the reader to the other commentaries in this chapter, which focus on psychotherapy and integrated treatment.) The third commentary (Integrative Perspective, by Matthew K. Nock and Tara L Deliberto) states that unfortunately, no research evidence exists demonstrating the superiority of any one approach for the treatment of NSSI among adolescents (see Nock et al. 2007). Some evidence supports the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) for the treatment of adolescent suicide attempts, so these treatments should be considered among the best treatments currently available for adolescent self-injury. One of the useful features of using modular approaches such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and DBT in the treatment of NSSI is that they can be flexibly modified to treat unique cases (see Nock et al. 2004). Simpler interventions, such as the use of aerobic exercise, also have shown impressive effects in the treatment of NSSI and can be easily incorporated into any existing treatment regimen (see Wallenstein and Nock 2007).

During 24 hours of ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, 101 symptomatic and 298 asymptomatic ischemic episodes (ST-segment depression \textgreater 1 mm, duration \textgreater 1 minute) were observed. The number of ischemic episodes and the cumulative duration of ischemia showed a circadian variation with the highest values between 8 and 10 A.M. and between 4 and 5 P.M. associated with a similar circadian variation of heart rate. Mean duration of ischemic episodes, maximal amplitude of ST-segment depression during ischemic episodes and increase in heart rate before the onset of ischemic episodes showed no significant circadian variation. Heart rate at the onset of ischemic episodes and maximal heart rate during ischemic episodes were lower between midnight and A.M. than during other times of the day. The morning and afternoon increase in ischemic activity is not paralleled by changes reflecting a decrease in myocardial oxygen supply during these periods (heart rate at onset of ischemia, heart rate increase before onset of ischemia), but is paralleled by a similar circadian variation of heart rate.

However, because of the numerous side effects, use of the combination regimen might be restricted for patients consulting private practitioners specialized in hepatogastroenterology. Patients and method - Conducted in this specific context, this prospective clinical trial investigated the safety and efficacy of combination therapy in 197 patients. Therapy was given in compliance with the recommendations of the French consensus conference on hepatitis C treatment. Results - Commonly reported adverse effects were noted in 90 \% of patients, most occurring during the first three months, with a stable prevalence thereafter and resolution after treatment end. The most frequent adverse events were asthenia (35 to 37.5 \% according to the treatment group pruritus (25 to 26.3 \% ) and flu-like syndrome (19 to 21.7 \% ). A depressive syndrome was reported in 20 to 21 \% of patients. Grade 4 neutropenia was exceptional and never led to severe infections. At intent-to-treat analysis, the rate of sustained virological response was 54.8 \% for the entire population. It was 71.1 \% for patients with genotypes 2 or 3 (mainly treated for 24 weeks) and 44.6 \% for patients with genotype 1 (all treated 48 weeks). Conclusion - The characteristic features of combination therapy observed in the context of private hepatogastroenterology consultations are similar to those observed in randomized clinical trials. \textcopyright 2007.

709,An exploration of the clinician's experience of relational therapy when working with women with eating disorders.,"Fishman, Julianne E.","The purpose of this study is to deepen our understanding of the experiences of relational clinicians who work with women that struggle with eating disorders. Relational-Cultural Theory informs this study insofar as eating disorders are understood as reflecting a lack of mutuality in relationships and contribute to the etiology and maintenance of mental health problems. In this project, mutuality is informed by psychodynamic theory and defined as attunement and responsiveness to the subjective, inner experience of the other, at a cognitive and affective level. Fostering mutuality in therapy is done via empathic attunement and purposeful self-disclosure. Unlike the detached, observing Freudian therapist, self-disclosure is defined in this study as authentically representing oneself in the therapy relationship. The relational clinician self-discloses by revealing their thoughts and feelings to enhance the growth of the client. The literature review indicates that while there is a significant association between a women's struggle with food and her relationships with family, peer, and romantic partners, there is a scarcity of literature focusing on the relationship with the clinician. The current study addresses this insufficiency. Eight participants were selected for this study after passing a pre-screening questionnaire in which they self-identified as relational . Participants were interviewed face-to-face using a semi-structured and open-ended question format. These interviews helped to inform the researcher's conceptualization of the therapists' subjective experience. Qualitative methods allow for greater opportunity to yield a more comprehensive understanding of treatment for eating disorders. Interviews were analyzed using a thematic analysis. Interview results highlight the following shared intentions in relational therapy: therapeutic relationship as central, seeing the client's perspective, using self-disclosure, making space for all of the client's feelings, honoring the client's needs, and being present in the therapeutic relationship . The few unexpected themes that unfolded include: multidisciplinary approach as a support for individual therapy, self-disclosure as an intuitive process, and tolerating one's own discomfort. This project increased our understanding of the intentions and styles of relational therapists. These findings are applicable to both the training of new therapists and the ongoing work of experienced practitioners as they treat this pervasive and complex illness.

Hospital personnel who were exposed to frequent missile attacks and casualties of war, both military and civilians (n = 106), were assessed for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and depression a month after the war between Lebanon and Israel erupted. Increased risk for PTSD symptoms was found to be highly associated with increased risk for depression. Logistic regression analysis showed that hospital personnel with increased risk for PTSD symptoms had a significantly elevated risk for depression in comparison to hospital personnel without increased risk for PTSD symptoms (odds ratio = 18.86, 95 \% CI = 4.08-87.07). These findings show that hospital personnel exposed to prolonged war stress exhibited higher levels of depression in comparison to previous single exposure researches. No profession differences were found in the levels of depression, but physicians were found to be less vulnerable than other hospital staff to develop PTSD symptoms. PTSD symptoms were significantly associated with depression. The results warrant further longitudinal study. \textcopyright 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, the identification of risk genes for major depressive disorder (MDD) has been unsuccessful because the etiology of MDD is more influenced by environmental factors; thus, gene-environment (GxE) interactions are important, such as interplay with stressful life events (SLEs). We assessed the GxE interactions and main effects of genes targeting depressive symptoms. Using a case-control design, 922 hospital staff members were evaluated for depressive symptoms according to Beck Depressive Inventory (BDI; depression and control groups were classified by scores of 10 in the BDI test), SLEs, and personality. A total of sixty-three genetic variants were selected on the basis of previous GWASs of MDD, SCZ, and BD as well as candidate-gene (SLC6A4, BDNF, DBH, and FKBP5) studies. Logistic regression analysis revealed a marginally significant interaction (genetic variant x SLE) at rs4523957 (Puncorrected=0.0034) with depression and a significant association of single nucleotide polymorphism identified from evidence of BD GWAS (rs7296288, downstream of DHH at 12q13.1) with depression as the main effect (Puncorrected=9.461024, Pcorrected=0.0424). We also found that SLEs had a larger impact on depression (odds ratio∼3), as reported previously. These results suggest that DHH plays a possible role in depression etiology; however, variants from MDD or SCZ GWAS evidence or candidate genes showed no significant associations or minimal effects of interactions with SLEs on depression.",2014.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0115135,VP5AWTIL,0,personality,714
714,Psychopharmacologic intervention for depression in the elderly.,"Strauss, Donald; Solomon, Kenneth","Reviews the literature on the psychopharmacologic treatment of depression in the elderly and discusses clinical guidelines for the use of psychotropic drugs in the treatment of depression. The paucity and the inadequate quality of clinical research reports on drug treatment for depression in the geriatric population is noted. The failure of clinical investigators to provide methodologically sound clinical protocols, baseline values and diagnoses, and specific information adapted for the senescent patient has occurred not only throughout the history of psychopharmacology but continues as new psychotropic agents are developed and tested for the general population, disregarding the specialized needs of the elderly. Methodological limitations of the studies reviewed are delineated. While the studies posed useful questions, their conclusions were clouded by multiple design flaws, poor response criteria, unclear diagnostic classifications, and a lack of uniformity in defining geriatric populations. General rules of psychotropic drug prescribing based on clinical experience are examined, and psychopharmacokinetics in the elderly are reviewed. It is emphasized that the treatment of depression is both psychopharmacologic and psychotherapeutic. Psychotropic medications will lift the burden of vegetative and physiologic symptoms from a depressed individual; psychotherapy is necessary to improve the person's overall social functioning, to gain insight, to change cognitive patterns, and to help prevent recurrent episodes.

715,Posttraumatic stress disorder and depression following trauma: Understanding comorbidity,"O'Donnell, M. L.; Creamer, M.; Pattison, P.","Objective: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depression occur frequently following traumatic exposure, both as separate disorders and concurrently. This raises the question of whether PTSD and depression are separate disorders in the aftermath of trauma or part of a single general traumatic stress construct. This study aimed to explore the relationships among PTSD, depression, and comorbid PTSD/depression following traumatic injury. Method: A group of 363 injury survivors was assessed just prior to discharge from hospital and 3 and 12 months postinjury. Canonical correlations were used to examine the relationship between PTSD and depression symptom severity and a set of predictor variables. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify whether the diagnostic categories of PTSD, depression, and comorbid PTSD/depression were associated with different groups of predictors. Results: The majority of psychopathology in the aftermath of trauma was best conceptualized as a general traumatic stress factor, suggesting that when PTSD and depression occur together, they reflect a shared vulnerability with similar predictive variables. However, there was also evidence that in a minority of cases at 3 months, depression occurs independently from PTSD and was predicted by a different combination of variables. Conclusions: While PTSD and comorbid PTSD/depression are indistinguishable, the findings support the existence of depression as a separate construct in the acute, but not the chronic, aftermath of trauma.",2004.0,10.1176/appi.ajp.161.8.1390,BCEGDNPB,0,diathesis,716
716,The long-term impact of psychotherapy in patients with refractory angina,"Patel, P. A.; Ali, N.; Thapar, S.; Sainsbury, P. A.","Introduction: Patients with refractory angina have persistence of symptoms despite optimal pharmacological intervention and consideration for revascularisation. It constitutes significant public health burden, affecting in excess of 5% of patients with angina. Symptoms are typified by a maladaptive psychological response to ischaemic chest pain, commonly allied with high levels of anxiety and depression. Focus of management appears to lack a structured pathway of care to specifically address this issue. As a consequence, there is high morbidity in such patients with recurrent hospital admissions and compromise in quality of life. Our hospital has a specialised cardiology service to manage patients with refractory angina (BRAS). Management includes a short psychological intervention, composed of a course of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) combined with an education programme. A study into short-term impact has been previously conducted by our group, and demonstrated that intervention improved quality of life and reduced levels of anxiety and depression, without effects on frequency of symptoms. A follow-up study on the same cohort was conducted after a two-year duration, to compare short and long-term outcome measures. Methods: The intervention was composed of a 1 month course, delivered over 4 sessions with each lasting 2 hours. These were implemented by a Clinical Nurse Specialist and a Clinical Psychologist in partnership. As previously, assessment was performed using well-established and validated questionnaires (SF36 for quality of life, HADS for anxiety/depression, SAQ for angina frequency/GTN spray usage). Non-parametric data was analysed using Wilcoxon signed-rank testing and presented as medians. Statistical significance was defined as by p-values <0.05. Results: 33 patients were present in the initial study. Three underwent subsequent revascularisation and were therefore excluded from our analysis. Average age was 62 years (SD 12.6), with 25 males and 5 females. SF36 quality of life scores appeared higher (47 vs 44, p=0.023). Levels of anxiety (6 vs 8, p=0.032) and depression (5 vs 8, p=0.048) were improved. No statistically significant change was noted in frequency of angina (4 vs 3, p=0.106) or usage of GTN spray (4 vs 3, p=0.078). Conclusions: Our initial study suggested that a short course of psychological intervention was effective in improving patients' quality of life and mood. Despite the relatively small sample size, current results indicate that benefits are maintained in the longer term. This is achieved independent of improvements in frequency of angina or usage of GTN spray. We propose larger, multi-centre trials to establish correlations further.",2017.0,10.1093/eurheartj/ehx502.P900,VBG5VE3G,0,additional,717
717,Leptin secretion is related to chronicity and severity of the illness in bulimia nervosa.,"Monteleone, Palmiero; Martiadis, Vassilis; Colurcio, Barbara; Maj, Mario","OBJECTIVE: A reduction in circulating leptin has been reported in some patients with BN, but not in others. The reasons for such diversity have not been explained. Therefore, we measured plasma levels of leptin and other hormones in a large sample of patients with eating disorders and in healthy controls and explored differences between bulimics with low plasma leptin levels and those with normal concentrations of the hormone. METHOD: One hundred and twenty-seven women participated in the study. They were 33 patients with AN, 56 women with BN, and 38 healthy volunteers. All were drug free for at least 6 weeks. Blood samples were collected in the morning for determination of hormone levels. Eating-related psychopathology and depressive symptoms were rated by using specific psychopathological scales. RESULTS: As compared with healthy women, both underweight AN and normal-weight BN patients exhibited decreased plasma levels of leptin, prolactin, and 17beta-estradiol. Plasma levels of cortisol were increased in AN but not in BN women. In bulimics, circulating leptin was inversely correlated with the duration of the illness and the frequency of bingeing/vomiting. Moreover, 29 bulimics had anorexic-like plasma leptin concentrations; the remaining 27 had circulating leptin similar to normal controls. The former had a significantly longer duration of the illness and a higher frequency of bingeing/vomiting compared with the latter. Moreover, a higher number of patients with concomitant borderline personality disorder were found in bulimics with low leptin concentrations. No significant differences between the two groups emerged in BW, BMI, mean plasma levels of cortisol, PRL, 17beta-estradiol and other clinical parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Present data show that leptin production is decreased in the subgroup of bulimic patients with a more chronic disease and with a greater severity of the bingeing/vomiting behavior. These findings support the idea that factors other than body weight changes (especially chronic malnutrition and bingeing behavior) may impair profoundly and persistently leptin secretion in patients with BN.",2002.0,,HNVHXABD,0,personality,718
718,Who takes precautionary action in the face of the new H1N1 influenza? Prediction of who collects a free hand sanitizer using a health behavior model.,"Reuter, Tabea; Renner, Britta","BACKGROUND: In order to fight the spread of the novel H1N1 influenza, health authorities worldwide called for a change in hygiene behavior. Within a longitudinal study, we examined who collected a free bottle of hand sanitizer towards the end of the first swine flu pandemic wave in December 2009. METHODS: 629 participants took part in a longitudinal study assessing perceived likelihood and severity of an H1N1 infection, and H1N1 influenza related negative affect (i.e., feelings of threat, concern, and worry) at T1 (October 2009, week 43-44) and T2 (December 2009, week 51-52). Importantly, all participants received a voucher for a bottle of hand sanitizer at T2 which could be redeemed in a university office newly established for this occasion at T3 (ranging between 1-4 days after T2). RESULTS: Both a sequential longitudinal model (M2) as well as a change score model (M3) showed that greater perceived likelihood and severity at T1 (M2) or changes in perceived likelihood and severity between T1 and T2 (M3) did not directly drive protective behavior (T3), but showed a significant indirect impact on behavior through H1N1 influenza related negative affect. Specifically, increases in perceived likelihood (beta = .12), severity (beta = .24) and their interaction (beta = .13) were associated with a more pronounced change in negative affect (M3). The more threatened, concerned and worried people felt (T2), the more likely they were to redeem the voucher at T3 (OR = 1.20). CONCLUSIONS: Affective components need to be considered in health behavior models. Perceived likelihood and severity of an influenza infection represent necessary but not sufficient self-referential knowledge for paving the way for preventive behaviors.",2011.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0022130,3EVMJZTR,0,cognitive_additional,719
719,Catastrophizing as a cognitive vulnerability factor related to depression in workers' compensation patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain.,"Lee, Eun-Jeong; Wu, Ming-Yi; Lee, Gloria K.; Cheing, Gladys; Chan, Fong","The purpose of this study was to examine the role of catastrophizing as a mediator and moderator between life stress and depression in a sample of workers' compensation patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Pain intensity, life stress (especially work and financial stress), and catastrophizing contributed significantly to depression. Catastrophizing was found to be partially mediating the relationship between life stress and depression and a moderator between social stress and depression. The results supported the role of catastrophizing as a cognitive vulnerability-stress factor related to depression in chronic pain patients. Screening for life stress and intervening early to prevent catastrophizing from occurring in the workers' compensation rehabilitation process may reduce psychosocial distress and enhance the overall effectiveness of rehabilitation programming for workers' compensation patients with chronic pain.",2008.0,10.1007/s10880-008-9118-7,JQITL7YW,0,cognitive,720

We collected data for 26 matched outpatients at pre- and posttreatment, as well as at 1-year follow-up. Outcome measures were the days of incapacity to work (DIW) as well as self-report measures (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI], Symptom Checklist 90-R [GSI], Life Satisfaction Questionnaire [FLZ]). We analyzed data with hierarchical linear modeling in a 2-level model. Therapy effects were defined in 3 ways: effect size (ES), response (based on the reliable change index), and remission compared with the general population's symptom level. The DIW were reduced significantly after both types of treatment, but employees showed even fewer DIW after W-CBT. At follow-up, significantly more employees were working as a result of W-CBT than with CBT-AU. Significant improvements on scores of self-rating measures corresponded with moderate-to-large effect sizes for both treatment types. Approximately 2 thirds of the treated employees were categorized as unimpaired on BDI scores at posttreatment and at follow-up. At least 1 half of the employees were classified as unimpaired on GSI scores at both assessment points. In future research, a randomized controlled trial should be conducted using a larger sample size to investigate the impact of moderators (e.g., employees at different branches of the company). Findings provided support for using common CBT techniques to enhance return to work without losing expected improvements at the symptom level.",2015.0,10.1037/a0038341,9LQ2PDEK,0,cognitive,721

This study examined the prospective relations of preadolescent girls' emotion regulation and parenting style with depressive symptoms. Participants were 225 children and their biological mothers recruited from a larger longitudinal community study. Girls' observed positive and negative emotion during a conflict resolution task with mothers, their ability to regulate sadness and anger, and their perception of parental acceptance and psychological control were assessed at age 9. Depressive symptoms were assessed by self-report at ages 9 and 10. The results indicated interactions between child emotion characteristics and parenting in predicting later depression. Specifically, low levels of positive emotion expression predicted higher levels of depressive symptoms in the context of moderate to high parental psychological control. Low levels of sadness regulation were predictive of high levels of depressive symptoms in the context of low to moderate parental acceptance. Findings from this study support the hypothesis that the prospective association between vulnerabilities in emotion regulation and depression are moderated by the caregiving environment.",2009.0,10.1037/a0014617,F4VSE5ZY,0,cognitive_additional,722

METHODS: Data were gathered as part of a randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of substance abuse treatment in pregnant women. Women (n=176) were recruited before 28 completed weeks of pregnancy, and followed until 3months postpartum. Depression was assessed using the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology and the MINI Neuropsychiatric Interview. Our outcome was the average number of cigarettes smoked per day. Linear mixed effects regression was used to measure differential changes in smoking. RESULTS: 66 \% of women smoked in the three months before pregnancy, 42 \% of pre-pregnancy smokers achieved abstinence before delivery and 60 \% of the baseline cohort smoked postpartum. Smoking did not differ significantly between depressed and non-depressed groups. After delivery both groups increased smoking at similar rates. CONCLUSION: Smoking was common among our cohort of pregnant women with a history of substance use. Women were able to discontinue or decrease smoking during pregnancy, but were likely to resume or increase smoking postpartum.

The chapter reviewed possible aims and targeted cognitive, psychodynamic and interpersonal psychosocial interventions in patients with CHD, Most behavioral interventions focused on psychic symptoms (like depression), personality traits (like type A, type D), social support, and few focused on hard outcome measures like cardiac events or mortality, Psychodynamic and interpersonal psychotherapies seem to improve the person-therapy-fit. There are only few treatment studies to reduce anxiety in CHD, none of them focused on gender or biological factors. Data of the Berlin Anxiety Trial (BAT) will be presented. Behavioral treatment groups, partly gender separated (16 sessions), were administered. In contrast to previous studies women improved more in anxiety symptoms after a psychosocial intervention than men. Beside the importance of the gender aspect, the study shows that anxiety can be reduced, while biological factors are taken into account. The study also demonstrated an influence on the psychological outcomes of this psychosocial intervention in CHD.

Radicalisation was measured by 16 questions asking about sympathies for violent protest and terrorism. Cluster analysis of the 16 items generated three groups: most sympathetic (or most vulnerable), most condemning (most resistant), and a large intermediary group that acted as a reference group. Associations were calculated with depression (PHQ9), anxiety (GAD7), poor health, and psychosocial adversity (adverse life events, perceived discrimination, unemployment). We also investigated protective factors such as the number social contacts, social capital (trust, satisfaction, feeling safe), political engagement and religiosity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Those showing the most sympathy for violent protest and terrorism were more likely to report depression (PHQ9 score of 5 or more; RR = 5.43, 1.35 to 21.84) and to report religion to be important (less often said religion was fairly rather than very important; RR = 0.08, 0.01 to 0.48). Resistance to radicalisation measured by condemnation of violent protest and terrorism was associated with larger number of social contacts (per contact: RR = 1.52, 1.26 to 1.83), less social capital (RR = 0.63, 0.50 to 0.80), unavailability for work due to housekeeping or disability (RR = 8.81, 1.06 to 37.46), and not being born in the UK (RR = 0.22, 0.08 to 0.65).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Vulnerability to radicalisation is characterised by depression but resistance to radicalisation shows a different profile of health and psychosocial variables.

Interventions addressing the supportive care needs of people with melanoma are rare, and needs are often overlooked. The study evaluated a newly developed, evidence-based, psycho-educational resource for people with melanoma. METHODS: The evaluation study comprised three groups: adults at high risk of new primary disease due to multiple previous melanomas or one melanoma and dysplastic nevus syndrome (DNS), adults at moderate risk due to one previous melanoma and no DNS, and health professionals involved in melanoma care. Participants evaluated a 68-page psycho-educational booklet, Melanoma: Questions and Answers, developed by a multidisciplinary team in accordance with published evidence, clinical guidelines, and intervention development frameworks. The booklet comprised seven modules featuring information on melanoma diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and ongoing clinical management; risk factors and the role of genetic counseling services for melanoma; psycho-education on emotional, behavioral, and cognitive responses to melanoma, including psycho-education on fear of cancer recurrence; description of healthy coping responses; a suite of tailored tools to support skin self-examination, doctor-patient communication, and identification of the signs and symptoms of anxiety and depression; a list of community-based services and resources; and tools to support melanoma-related record keeping and monitoring. Resource acceptability, relevance, quality, dissemination preferences, emotional responses, unmet information needs, and demographic characteristics were assessed. RESULTS: Nineteen melanoma survivors (response rate 50 \% ) and 10 health professionals (response rate 83 \% ) evaluated the resource. Responses were overwhelmingly positive; the booklet was thoroughly read and highly rated in terms of quality and quantity of information, utility of health education tools, and capacity to address unmet needs. Ninety-five percent of melanoma survivors would recommend the booklet to others. Most preferred a paper-based format, provided by their treating doctor at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Melanoma: Questions and Answers was feasible and acceptable and demonstrated a strong capacity to address the information and psycho-educational needs of people with melanoma at low fiscal cost.",2016.0,10.1007/s00520-016-3339-3,GYL6LJSY,0,cognitive,728

However, little is known about mentalization in chronic depression. This study investigated the role of mentalization in the long-term psychoanalytic treatment of chronic depression. Mentalization measured with the Reflective Functioning Scale (RFS) was examined in patients with chronic depression (n = 20) in long-term psychoanalytic treatment and compared to healthy controls (n = 20). Results show that global RF scores did not differ significantly between patients and controls. However, depressed patients tended to have lower RF scores concerning issues of loss. Furthermore, RF was unrelated to symptoms and distress as assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the SCL-90. RF did not predict therapeutic outcome as measured with the BDI but predicted changes in general distress after 8 months of psychoanalytic treatment as measured by the SCL-90. Moreover, correlations between RF and the Helping Alliance Questionnaire indicated that patients with higher RF were able to establish a therapeutic alliance more easily compared to patients with low RF.",2011.0,10.1521/psyc.2011.74.1.49,DLTH9BG5,0,cognitive_additional,730

To our knowledge, there have been no meta-analyses to evaluate the effectiveness of these therapies. Method After a broad search, we meta-analyzed controlled outcome studies of short-term psychodynamic psychotherapies (STPP, 40 or fewer sessions). We also performed sensitivity analyses and evaluated the risk of bias in this body of studies. Results We found 11 studies with a total of 655 patients covering a broad range of conditions including depression, anxiety disorders, anorexia nervosa, and borderline personality disorder. STPP did not separate from what were mostly robust treatment comparators, but there were some subgroup differences. Robust (g = 1.07, 95 \% CI = 0.80-1.34) within group effect sizes were observed suggesting the treatment may be effective.

731,Bipolar disorder and its relation to major psychiatric disorders: a family-based study in the Swedish population.,"Song, Jie; Bergen, Sarah E.; Kuja-Halkola, Ralf; Larsson, Henrik; Landen, Mikael; Lichtenstein, Paul","OBJECTIVES: Bipolar disorder (BPD) shares genetic components with other psychiatric disorders; however, uncertainty remains about where in the psychiatric spectra BPD falls. To understand the etiology of BPD, we studied the familial aggregation of BPD and co-aggregation between BPD and schizophrenia, depression, anxiety disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, drug abuse, personality disorders, and autism spectrum disorders. METHODS: A population-based cohort was created by linking several Swedish national registers. A total of 54,723 individuals with BPD were identified among 8,141,033 offspring from 4,149,748 nuclear families. The relative risk of BPD in relatives and the co-occurrence of other psychiatric disorders in patients with BPD and their relatives were compared to those of matched-population controls. Structural equation modeling was used to estimate the heritability and tetrachoric correlation. RESULTS: The familial risks for relatives of BPD probands were 5.8-7.9 in first-degree relatives, and decreased with genetic distance. Co-occurrence risks for other psychiatric disorders were 9.7-22.9 in individuals with BPD and 1.7-2.8 in full siblings of BPD probands. Heritability for BPD was estimated at 58 \ \% \ . The correlations between BPD and other psychiatric disorders were considerable (0.37-0.62) and primarily due to genetic effects. The correlation with depression was the highest (0.62), and was 0.44 for schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: The high familial risks provide evidence that genetic factors play an important role in the etiology of BPD, and the shared genetic determinants suggest pleiotropic effects across different psychiatric disorders. Results also indicate that BPD is in both the mood and psychotic spectra, but possibly more closely related to mood disorders.",2015.0,10.1111/bdi.12242,X36CSNB3,0,personality,732

It is unknown how this association generalizes to individuals. The aim of the present study was to investigate interindividual differences in the bidirectional dynamic relationship between physical activity and affect, in depressed and nondepressed individuals, using time-series analysis. METHOD: A pair-matched sample of 10 depressed and 10 nondepressed participants (mean age = 36.6, SD = 8.9, 30 \% males) wore accelerometers and completed electronic questionnaires 3 times a day for 30 days. Physical activity was operationalized as the total energy expenditure (EE) per day segment (i.e., 6 hr). The multivariate time series (T = 90) of every individual were analyzed using vector autoregressive modeling (VAR), with the aim to assess direct as well as lagged (i.e., over 1 day) effects of EE on positive and negative affect, and vice versa. RESULTS: Large interindividual differences in the strength, direction and temporal aspects of the relationship between physical activity and positive and negative affect were observed. An exception was the direct (but not the lagged) effect of physical activity on positive affect, which was positive in nearly all individuals. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the association between physical activity and affect varied considerably across individuals. Thus, while at the group level the effect of physical activity on affect may be small, in some individuals the effect may be clinically relevant.",2015.0,10.1037/hea0000303,E4JIZB7R,0,cognitive_additional,733
733,Baclofen/Diazepam Supps for Treatment of Pelvic Floor Myalgia,Nct,"Chronic pelvic pain is a complex multi‐faceted problem that places a substantial burden on the healthcare resources. In Canada, the average hospital related cost for women requiring surgery or inpatient admission for chronic pelvic pain is $25 million each year. Chronic pelvic pain is defined as either persistent pain for at least 6 months or ""recurrent episodes of abdominal/pelvic pain, hypersensitivity, or discomfort, often associated with elimination changes and sexual dysfunction in the absence of an organic etiology."" Chronic pelvic pain is common and affects women of all ages and backgrounds. 15‐20% of women have chronic pelvic pain lasting for more than 1 year. Pelvic floor myalgia is an important and common contributor to chronic pelvic pain that may be present alone or may co‐exist with other gynecological, urological, colorectal, and musculoskeletal medical conditions. The International Urogynecological Association/International Continence Society joint report published in February 2017 defines pelvic floor myalgia as pain in the musculature of the pelvic floor.6 Patients with high‐tone pelvic floor dysfunction (HTPFD) have levator hypercontractility and present with pain with internal vaginal examination and intercourse. In a 2011 prospective cross‐sectional study by Fitzgerald et al., 63% of patients with self‐reported chronic pelvic pain examined by a physician and 73.7% of patients examined by a physiotherapist were found to have pelvic floor myalgia. Although pelvic floor myalgia is a common condition encountered in gynecology, it is frequently an unrecognized and under‐treated component of chronic pelvic pain. Pelvic floor myalgia has a significant impact on the patient's quality of life. Persistent chronic pain may result in patient's anxiety, low mood, depression, sleep disturbances, feeling of hopelessness and helplessness, frustration, and psychological distress. The first line of treatment for pelvic floor myalgia is pelvic floor muscle relaxation. Reducing the resting tone of pelvic floor musculature has been shown to improve chronic pelvic pain. Current treatment options for pelvic floor myalgia include pelvic floor physiotherapy, Thiele massage, biofeedback with electrical stimulation, behavioural modifications, acupuncture, medications such as antidepressants,1 trigger point injections with botulin A toxin, warm sitz baths, and neuromodulation. Recently, intravaginal diazepam has been used an off‐label treatment option for high‐tone pelvic floor myalgia. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine derivative that has both antispasmotic and anxiolytic activity. It is used as a muscle relaxant and enhances the inhibitory action of gamma‐amino butyric acid (GABA) on neuronal excitability, resulting in decreased action potentials. The benefit of local therapy is the avoidance of the common side effects of benzodiazepines such as drowsiness, fatigue, and ataxia. Currently, evidence is lacking in regards to the effectiveness of intravaginal diazepam on treatment of chronic pelvic pain. The 2010 retrospective chart review of 26 patients by Rogalski et al. revealed clinically significant reduction in Visual Analogue Scale for Pain (VAS‐P) and Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) with diazepam suppositories used for 30 days as an adjuvant therapy to pelvic floor physiotherapy and intramuscular trigger point injections. Similarly, the 2011 study revealed 62% improvement in symptoms with intravaginal diazepam. Baclofen is a skeletal muscle relaxant. It is a GABA‐B receptor agonist which is commonly used for treating spasticity. The literature on topical baclofen use in pelvic floor dysfunction is minimal. Topical therapy is advantageous to avoid the common systemic side effects such as drowsiness, hypotonia, hypotension, and headache. A retrospective study examining the use of topical baclofen for provoked vulvodynia showed an improvement in pain and sexual function. Baclofen may also be used in combination with diazepam for treatment of pelvic floor myalgia.

734,Interaction between stress and the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism in depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Hosang, G. M.; Shiles, C.; Tansey, K. E.; McGuffin, P.; Uher, R.","Background: Major depression is a disabling psychiatric illness with complex origins. Life stress (childhood adversity and recent stressful events) is a robust risk factor for depression. The relationship between life stress and Val66Met polymorphism in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene has received much attention. The aim of the present work was to review and conduct a meta-analysis on the results from published studies examining this interaction.Methods: A literature search was conducted using PsychINFO and PubMed databases until 22 November 2013. A total of 22 studies with a pooled total of 14,233 participants met the inclusion criteria, the results of which were combined and a meta-analysis performed using the Liptak-Stouffer z-score method.Results: The results suggest that the Met allele of BDNF Val66Met significantly moderates the relationship between life stress and depression (P = 0.03). When the studies were stratified by type of environmental stressor, the evidence was stronger for an interaction with stressful life events (P = 0.01) and weaker for interaction of BDNF Val66Met with childhood adversity (P = 0.051).Conclusions: The interaction between BDNF and life stress in depression is stronger for stressful life events rather than childhood adversity. Methodological limitations of existing studies include poor measurement of life stress. \textcopyright 2014 Hosang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2014.0,10.1186/1741-7015-12-7,Q54ST544,0,diathesis,735

Patients may be overwhelmed by the immediate necessities of choosing physicians, making treatment decisions, coping with side effects of treatment, navigating insurance coverage and finances, and managing the disruption to the family. Added to this burden may be depressive and anxiety disorders-a prevalence exceeding 20 \% .' In this chapter we focus on the treatment of anxiety and depression in cancer patients who have been underserved by the psychological/ psychiatric and oncology communities. With aging, adults become vulnerable to physical illnesses, and illnesses, disability, and functional decline are risk factors for mental disorders. Despite the added risk that chronic illness poses, there has been a dearth of research on psychiatric disorders and their treatment among cancer patients. However, in recent years, trials examining the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety and depression have been reported. Results of these trials suggest that CBT is associated with improvement in symptoms of anxiety and depression among cancer patients.

S.; Secades-Villa, R.; Keyes, K.; Lin, K. H.; Grant, B.; Blanco, C.","Background: An extensive clinical literature has noted gender differences in the etiology and clinical characteristics of individuals with alcohol dependence (AD). Despite this knowledge, many important questions remain. Methods: Using the 2001 to 2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (n = 43,093), we examined differences in sociodemographic characteristics, psychiatric and medical comorbidities, clinical correlates, risk factors, and treatment-utilization patterns of men (N = 2,974) and women (N = 1,807) with lifetime AD. Results: Men with lifetime AD were more likely than women to be diagnosed with any substance use disorder and antisocial personality disorder, whereas women were more likely to have mood and anxiety disorders. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and gender differences in psychiatric comorbidity in the general population, AD was associated with externalizing disorders and any mood disorder among women only. Men with AD met more criteria, had longer episodes, and were younger at the age of first drink. There were no gender differences in remission rates. Women with AD were more likely to have a family and a spouse with history of alcohol use disorders. Treatment rates were low for both genders, and women were more likely to report social stigmatization as a treatment barrier. Conclusions: There are important gender differences in the psychiatric comorbidities, risk factors, clinical characteristics, and treatment-utilization patterns among individuals with lifetime AD. \ \textcopyright \ 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.",2013.0,,MBEHBQGW,0,personality,737
737,Overtones of the voice: Some clinical and developmental issues in psychoanalytic psychotherapy.,,"The rise of language occurs simultaneously in the life of a very young child with the capacity to form self-identity. For this reason, specific characteristics of a person's subsequent use of language may facilitate recognition of factors that were significant to ego formation. Affective memories are laid down in this process and fixed for ego-management. G. H. Bower (1981) demonstrated how a whole nexus of affective memories can be elicited when a specific key association is activated. In 2 case illustrations, with a 16-yr-old girl with borderline and hysterical symptoms and a 28-yr-old woman, psychoanalytic treatment was facilitated by the use of key verbal associations. In both cases, these associations proved to be inwardly permissible because they were based on forms linked to developmental levels rather than the content of what was being expressed.

M.; Finkelstein, D. M.; Cooper, T. B.; Jimerson, D. C.","Abnormal serotonergic regulation in bulimia nervosa is thought to contribute to recurrent binge eating, depressed mood, and impulsivity. To follow-up on previous studies showing decreased neuroendocrine responses in symptomatic patients, this study assessed serotonin-mediated prolactin responses in individuals who had remitted from bulimia nervosa. Subjects included 21 women with a history of bulimia nervosa and 21 healthy female controls, as well as an additional comparison group of 19 women with current bulimia nervosa. Placebo-controlled neuroendocrine response studies utilized a single oral dose (60 mg) of the indirect serotonin agonist d,l- fenfluramine. For the bulimia nervosa remitted group, the fenfluramine- stimulated elevation in serum prolactin concentration was not significantly different from the response in healthy controls, but was significantly larger than the response in patients with current bulimia nervosa (p \textless .01). These findings suggest that diminished serotonergic neuroendocrine responsiveness in bulimia nervosa reflects a state-related abnormality.

Data from measures assessing verbal and numerical ability that were administered to 40 undergraduates in an ego-enhancing and 45 in an ego-diminishing feedback condition indicated more attribution of problem-solving success by the 1st group to effort and to ease of the task. Ss who received ego-diminishing feedback attributed their initial problem-solving success less to ease of the task. Other more direct evidence of self-protective strategies on the part of Ss in the ego-diminishing feedback condition included lower success expectancy on retest and reduced volunteering for additional challenge. Findings are interpreted as evidence of the impact of generalized esteem-related affect on future success expectancy, on risk taking, and on the attribution of success when future replication is a boundary condition.

AIMS: To identify clinical predictors for IFN-$\alpha$-induced depression during antiviral therapy for HCV infection. METHOD: Depression (defined with the Montgomery- \AA sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)) was evaluated before and during antiviral treatment in 91 people with chronic HCV infection without a history of psychiatric disorders. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Trail Making Test A/B (TMT A/B). (Trial registration at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00136318.) RESULTS: Depression during antiviral therapy was significantly associated with a baseline MADRS score of 3 or higher (P = 0.006). In total, 89 \% (n = 16) of patients who had a baseline score \textgreater 0 for the single item sadness developed depression. Poor baseline performance in the TMT A (P = 0.027) and TMT B (P = 0.033) was predictive for severe depression.

741,Sexual dysfunction among women with a history of childhood sexual abuse: The role of negative appraisal of genital sexual arousal and sexual shame,"Pulverman, C.; Meston, C.","Objective: Women with a history of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) are at a higher risk of sexual dysfunction and do not respond to existing treatments as well as non-abused women, suggesting there may be something unique about the presentation of sexual dysfunction in this population. For abused women, genital sensations may become paired with negative affect during the abuse. Therefore the genital arousal that arises during consensual sexual activity might remind a woman of her abuse, impairing her overall sexual response in the present. This study examined women's appraisal of their genital sexual arousal as a potential mechanism underlying the relationship between history of CSA and sexual dysfunction. Materials and Methods: Women with (n = 60) and without (n = 46) a history of CSA viewed a 6-minute erotic film and completed an adapted version of the Film Scale (Heiman \& Rowland, 1983) by rating their genital arousal sensations on a series of affective words. Sexual function was assessed with the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI; Rosen et al., 2000) and sexual shame was assessed with the Kyle Inventory of Sexual Shame (Kyle, 2013). A range of sexual function was reported across both groups of women (FSFI abused M = 23.84, SD = 6.21, range 7.60-34.20; FSFI non-abused M = 26.11, SD = 5.07, range 16-35.40). Results: Negative appraisal of genital sexual arousal was significantly higher in abused women (M = 7.30) than in non-abused women (M = 5.83). In a structural equation model using abuse status as a dichotomous independent variable, negative appraisal of genital sexual arousal partially mediated the relationship between a history of abuse and FSFI total scores (X2(1) = 4.24, RMSEA = .18). Sexual shame was significantly higher in abused women (M = 71.73) than non-abused women (M = 49.64). In a structural equation model, sexual shame fully mediated the relationship between a history of abuse and FSFI total scores (X2 (1) = 1.11, RMSEA = .03). Conclusions: Both negative appraisal of genital sexual arousal and sexual shame help to explain the relationship between a history of CSA and sexual dysfunction. Mindfulness-based sex therapy has been more effective for treating sexual dysfunction in abused women than non-abused women (Brotto et al., 2012), yet the mechanisms underlying this therapy remains unclear. The current results suggest examining appraisal of genital sexual arousal as a potential mechanism of action in mindfulness-based sex therapy treatments for abused women.",2016.0,,W9YREW55,0,psychodynamic,742

745,Risk of burnout among early career mental health professionals.,"Volpe, U.; Luciano, M.; Palumbo, C.; Sampogna, G. and","Burnout is a stress-related syndrome that often affects mental health professionals (MHPs) and may have serious consequences on personal well-being as well as on the quality of provided psychiatric care. Established literature shows a high risk to develop burnout among MHPs. Few data are available on the incidence and on the clinical implications of the burnout syndrome in the early phases of MHP professional career. We confirmed the presence of burnout among early career MHPs: early career psychiatrists showed a lower sense of personal accomplishment, while non-medical MHPs tended to have more depersonalization and suffered from higher levels of depression. Specific programmes to identify the presence of the burnout syndrome and to cope with it should be taught within mental health training curricula. Burnout is a stress-related syndrome that often affects professionals working in emotionally loaded and highly interpersonal environments. Mental health professionals (MHPs) are long known to be at high risk to develop the burnout syndrome, but this has rarely been investigated in professionals in an early phase of career. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of the burnout syndrome and of depressive symptoms among early career psychiatrists and 'non-medical' MHPs. One hundred MHPs (including 50 psychiatrists and 50 non-medical MHPs) were screened for the presence of burnout and depression, with the Maslach Burnout Inventory and the Beck Depression Inventory - revised, respectively. The relationships of burnout with socio-demographical and professional characteristics were also explored. We confirmed the presence of burnout among both groups of early career MHPs, but psychiatrists had a significantly higher degree of emotional exhaustion and a lower sense of personal accomplishment, while non-medical MHPs adopted more frequently depersonalization as a coping strategy and had higher scores for depression, which is associated with higher level of burnout. The risk of developing burnout should be properly addressed in training curricula and strategies to overcome it should be systematically taught, in order to promote personal well-being and efficient team work in mental health settings.",2014.0,10.1111/jpm.12137,5CSXX9DZ,0,cognitive_additional,746
746,Adolescent alienation: Examining the relevance of contextual domains and psychological components.,"Patterson, Robin L.","This theoretical framework defines and examines whether adolescent alienation is a multidimensional construct comprised of psychological components and contextual domains . It was hypothesized that alienation is comprised of four psychological components which are: (a) being alone, not spending time with others, being abandoned and isolated, (b) being a target, the occurrence of being made fun of and teased by others, (c) not fitting-in, being disliked, seen as different, or uninteresting by others, and (d) being cut-off, the occurrence of being ignored, rejected, or excluded by others. It was also hypothesized that alienation is experienced in four contextual domains which are people at school, friends, boyfriend/girlfriend, and family. It was examined whether both psychological components and contextual domains are relevant and the extents to which psychological components are specified within contextual domains or visa versa. The proposed framework of alienation was examined by developing and testing the psychometric properties of a new scale, the Adolescent Alienation Questionnaire (AAQ. Two studies were conducted with three primary objectives, namely to examine the (a) structure of alienation, (b) stability of alienation, and (c) impact of alienation on various mental health outcomes. Study 1 consisted of 1870 adolescents at Time 1 (Study 1A) and 1780 adolescents at Time 2 (Study 1B) from which data were collected approximately one year apart. Study 2 was comprised of three groups of adolescents, 31 adolescents who were distressed, 35 adolescents who previously self-harmed, and 35 comparison adolescents, who were followed each month for one year. Study 1 showed that the structure of adolescent alienation was supported. Stability of alienation was shown by good test-retest reliability. Results from Study 2 showed additional support for the structure and stability of alienation. It was shown that alienation was related to mental health outcomes (depressed mood, hopelessness, stress, and self-harm behaviours). It was also shown that adolescents who were distressed or previously self-harmed felt more alienated than the comparison adolescents. Two mediation models supported the sequence of alienation. The proposed theoretical framework of adolescent alienation was supported, stability for the AAQ was shown, and evidence was provided for the impact of alienation.

747,Mood and adherence effects of learned helplessness in rheumatoid arthritis: A prospective model test.,"Olmsted, Murrey G.","The present study tested the reformulated model of Learned Helplessness using a prospective cohort of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) outpatients. The study addressed a number of shortfalls in the literature, namely the need to measure preexisting trait perceived control tendencies and to use multiple measures of health status---the non-contingency event in the case of RA. The study also extended research in this area by assessing medication adherence as an outcome of learned helplessness. The study proposed an extended version of the reformulated model of Learned Helplessness in RA. A total of 175 outpatients, age 18 years or older, with a diagnosis of RA were contacted for recruitment into the study. Of those contacted, 76 qualified for participation and agreed to take part in a 6-month prospective study. Participants were initially contacted by mail to inform them that their Rheumatologist had referred them to the principal investigator to take part in this study. Those that agreed to participate were sent a package of questionnaires by mail (including informed consent) and subsequently interviewed twice in 10 days regarding their medication intake for their arthritis condition. Additionally, an audit of the participant's medical chart was conducted by a research fellow to verify the diagnosis of RA, obtain the patient's medication regimen, and assess their health status. Participants were contacted again after 6 months to complete the same protocol. The proposed model of Learned Helplessness in RA was tested using a variety of analytic techniques. The analysis consisted of first testing the assumptions of the model by evaluating the predicted linkages between variables (correlations), then testing the mediation effect of arthritis helplessness on the outcome variables (depressed mood and medication adherence) using structural equation modeling (SEM). The overall results indicated that the model fit the data well when evaluated at Time 1, Time 2, and prospectively using a combination of Time 1 predictors (and mediator) and Time 2 outcomes. Future studies should further explore outcomes such as medication adherence to enable both researchers and clinicians to understand and intervene on behalf of RA patients, decreasing the likelihood of helplessness-related deficits.

749,Sexual confusion among certain college males.,"Goff, J. L.","In dealing with college age (18-22) males, clinical observations have shown a fairly common inability to successfully form intimate relationships with same-age females. This problem often appears to be due to an inability to bond and trust that is rooted in the formative years in the nuclear home. When this happens, the young male frequently develops a fear of being sexually abnormal, perhaps even homosexual. This manifests itself in shame, anxiety, depression, denial, reaction formation, performance anxiety, concern about being found out, isolation, substance abuse and, occasionally, acting out. Getting such persons to admit these fears is generally extremely difficult, requiring gentle and empathetic, but persistent, probing on the part of the therapist. Therapy consists of understanding and acceptance by the client that these fears are most often reactive, that they are commonly held, and that when they are seen in proper perspective, they often diminish. The present paper reviews some of the literature on sexual developmental issues of the adolescent male as a backdrop for this problem. The specific difficulties related to reactive homophobia are explored, and some therapeutic approaches suggested.",1990.0,,PTJ6RVJK,0,psychodynamic,750

This is in disagreement with Freud's implicit equation of sexuality and sensuality, and the assertion that all sensual pleasures are sublimations of an underlying sexual instinct. The term instinct should be reserved for libidinal and aggressive action patterns or motivations that are the outcomes of a common stimulus-seeking characteristic of the CNS. Sexuality refers to a separate motivational system. Affective responses elicit pleasure directly through the amygdala, but sensations do not have the quality of erotogenesis unless they are mediated by the genital sensory system. An early neonate condition is proposed in which stimuli are recorded as sensual events along a comfort-discomfort gradient devoid of the discrete properties of affects or true pleasure-unpleasure tagging.

METHODS: We present three patients who received a cochlear implant (CI) despite a serious psychiatric disorder. Two were sent from psychiatrists asking if a CI was possible for their profound hearing loss. One patient had acoustic hallucinations and a recurrent depressive disorder, the other had a schizophrenic psychosis and a minor impairment of intelligence. The third patient had a recurrent depressive disorder, a posttraumatic stress disorder, a chronic pain disorder, and paranoid personality traits. We discuss the preoperative diagnosis, course of diseases, and psychosocial situation. RESULTS: All three patients received a CI and rehabilitation in the Cochlear Implant Center of the University Hospital of Heidelberg. All three of them opted for a second implant and developed a good hearing outcome. Free field understanding of words in quite is for all three of them over 60% in the Freiburger monosyllable test with two implants, similar to nonpsychiatric patients' results.

Methods: The sample 165 African- American women, 18-29 years of age, were recruited by street outreach from a lower socioeconomic community in San Francisco, CA. A face-to-face interview was administered to assess HIV/STD-sexual risk practices, alcohol use, physical abuse, affective health, and relationship commitment. Childhood sexual abuse was defined as experiencing forced sex prior to age 16. Results: The prevalence of childhood sexual abuse in this sample was 13.3 \% . Compared to women who were not abused during childhood, women who reported a history of childhood sexual abuse were 1.5 times more likely to have had an abortion, 1.4 times more likely to report having an STD, 2.4 times as likely to report having greater than two lifetime STDs, 3.8 times as likely to have a history of anal sex, 2.6 times as likely to worry about acquiring HIV, 3.9 times more likely to believe their partner did not care for them, twice as likely to doubt the longevity of their relationship, 5.1 times as likely to have a partner who had been physically abusive within the previous 3 months, 2.6 times as likely to have a partner who was physically abusive when asked to use condoms, and 1.5 times as likely to consume three or more glasses of alcohol at one time.

Method: The authors conducted a 16-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial for geriatric depression in 143 older outpatients diagnosed with major depression comparing treatment response in three treatment groups: methylphenidate plus placebo (N=48), citalopram plus placebo (N = 48), and citalopram plus methylphenidate (N = 47). The primary outcome measure was change in depression severity. Remission was defined as a score of 6 or less on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes included measures of anxiety, apathy, quality of life, and cognition. Results: Daily doses ranged from 20 mg to 60 mg for citalopram (mean = 32 mg) and from 5 mg to 40 mg for methylphenidate (mean=16 mg). All groups showed significant improvement in depression severity and in cognitive performance. However, the improvement in depression severity and the Clinical Global Impressions improvement score was more prominent in the citalopram plus methylphenidate group compared with the other two groups. Additionally, the rate of improvement in the citalopram plus methylphenidate group was significantly higher than that in the citalopram plus placebo group in the first 4 weeks of the trial. The groups did not differ in cognitive improvement or number of side effects. Conclusions: Combined treatment with citalopram and methylphenidate demonstrated an enhanced clinical response profile in mood and well-being, as well as a higher rate of remission, compared with either drug alone. All treatments led to an improvement in cognitive functioning, although augmentation with methylphenidate did not offer additional benefits.

Participants are 351 obese men and women aged 21 to 65 years with an obesity-related comorbidity. Track participants are randomized to usual primary care or to a 12-month intervention consisting of algorithm-generated tailored behavior change goals, self-monitoring via mobile technologies, daily self-weighing using a network-connected scale, skills training materials, 18 counseling phone calls with a Track coach, and primary care provider counseling. Participants are followed over 12 months, with study visits at baseline, 6, and 12 months. Anthropometric data, blood pressure, fasting lipids, glucose and HbA1C and self-administered surveys are collected. Follow-up data will be collected from the medical record at 24 months. Results: Participants are 68 \% female and on average 50.7 years old with a mean BMI of 35.9 kg/m2. Participants are mainly black (54 \% ) or white (33 \% ); 12.5 \% are Hispanic. Participants are mostly employed and low-income. Over 20 \% of the sample has hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Almost 27 \% of participants currently smoke and almost 20 \% score above the clinical threshold for depression. Conclusions: Track utilizes an innovative, digital health approach to reduce obesity and chronic disease risk among medically vulnerable adults in the primary care setting. Baseline characteristics reflect a socioeconomically disadvantaged, high-risk patient population in need of evidence-based obesity treatment.",2016.0,10.1016/j.cct.2016.03.006,2NH6624U,0,cognitive_additional,755
755,Monitoring change in families receiving primary mental health specialist services: a pragmatic evaluation within an existing service for the under-fives,"Pollock, J.; Horrocks, S.","Background: Specialist CAMHS-based services for pre-school age children are being introduced in the UK using different models of care. The clinical value of these new services requires assessment. Method:: Over 20 months a Primary Mental Health Specialist (Under 5s) service operating in South West UK was evaluated on a variety of themes including effectiveness. Recruited clients completed questionnaires on their own well-being (on two occasions) and their child's behaviour (on three occasions) over the intervention period. Results: Of the 67 carers assessed at or shortly after recruitment using the General Health Questionnaire, 55.2 \% were at high risk of having a clinically significant affective mental condition. Despite a trend towards improvement, neither the GHQ-12 total score nor the proportion meeting the clinical criterion was statistically significantly reduced. The main index of child behaviour and emotional state demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the number of disturbance-indicating behaviours over the service intervention period. The largest changes occurred between recruitment and the 4th visit. Selection bias cannot be excluded. Conclusions: Significant changes determined over a relatively short period of intervention is consistent with an effect of service, but direct attribution demands care as no control groups were included. \textcopyright 2009 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.",2010.0,10.1111/j.1475-3588.2009.00545.x,TLHIIR27,0,cognitive_additional,756

M.","Purpose: The purpose of this 12-year longitudinal study was to assess the effects of maternal HIV/AIDS on child/adolescent well-being and behavioral outcomes, extending an earlier published account. Methods: Interviews were conducted with 66 pairs of healthy children and their mothers living with HIV/AIDS, who are participants in the Parents And children Coping Together (PACT) project begun in 1997. All study participants were English or Spanish speaking. About half (48.5 \% ) of the youth were female. Maternal health status (e.g., viral load biomedical marker, illness symptoms, physical functioning, and depression) and child/adolescent outcomes (e.g., depression, anxiety/worry, aggression, and self-concept) were assessed over 16 time points. Results: Using growth curve modeling, results show a negative effect of maternal health status on child/adolescent outcomes, including child/adolescent depression, anxiety/worry, aggression, and self-concept. Interaction effects within the growth models suggest younger children are more impacted by poor maternal health than are older children/adolescents. Conclusions: This is the first study to follow a cohort of children of mothers living with HIV/AIDS over such an extended age range, through late adolescence/early adulthood, to determine the impact of maternal health status throughout the entire developmental period. \textcopyright 2012 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

The basic assumption of the study was that individuals with a normal mental equilibrium and with sound object relations will bear up well to age-related changes unless a somatic disease interferes, while those with a psychic equilibrium built on a narrow basis will experience changes in middle age as overwhelming losses, activating early drive conflicts and causing the breakdown of self-esteem. Differences in diagnostic groups were slight. Somatic etiological factors were more common for patients than for controls. Analysis of interpersonal relations revealed extensive disturbances in the patient group. The presence of narcissistic problems was evident in patients, but not in controls. It is concluded that losses in later middle age and the subsequent depressive mechanism are crucial in the dynamics of paranoid psychoses and depression.

A double-blind comparison with electroconvulsive treatment.,"Langer, G.; Karazman, R.; Neumark, J.; Saletu, B.; Schonbeck, G.; Grunberger, J.; Dittrich, R.; Petricek, W.; Hoffmann, P.; Linzmayer, L.","This is the first report on a controlled study comparing the therapeutic and non-therapeutic (side) effects of electroconvulsive treatment (ECT) and isoflurane narcotherapy (ISONAR; deep anesthesias with the inhalation of anesthetic isoflurane) in drug-refractory, severely depressed women, who had been randomly allocated either to ECT (n = 10) or ISONAR (n = 10). Patients from each group were subjected to a total of six treatment sessions (two sessions per week) and maintained on a fixed antidepressant drug dose. The antidepressant efficacy of either treatment was evaluated for each treatment session (in search of a 'rapid antidepressant effect') and at weekly intervals. Cognitive functions or signs of an organic brain syndrome were evaluated by means of psychological tests and extensive EEG analyses. Rapid antidepressant effects of the first treatment session were only significant in patients on ISONAR; in the subsequent treatment sessions, ECT also induced rapid antidepressant effects. Antidepressant effects during the treatment period were comparable, and patients on ISONAR improved further during follow-up, whereas patients on ECT tended to relapse. ISONAR-treated patients improved in most psychometric variables, whereas patients on ECT deteriorated. Finally, the EEG patterns of the ISONAR-treated patients remained normal or augmented (dominant alpha power), whereas patients on ECT developed an increase in abnormalities in EEG patterns and theta/delta power. This indicates an organic brain syndrome in patients on ECT.",1995.0,,X9ZKCN6I,0,cognitive,762
762,Stress and psychosocial adjustment among people living with HIV/AIDS in China.,"Su, Xiaoyou","Introduction Mental health issues are prevalent among People Living with HIV (PLWH). Instrumentation, conceptualization and theoretical models of stress-coping-mental health relationships among PLWH are important but theoretical and practical differences exist in the context of different cultures and quality of care services. Objectives The aims of the study were 1) to develop a new Perceived Stress Scale for People Living with HIV (PSSHIV); 2) to validate the Brief COPE inventory among Chinese PLWH; 3) to investigate determinants of perceived stress and psychological well-being. Subject and Methods To achieve Aim 1, PLWH in two Chinese cities were interviewed for item generation and validation. Aims 2 to 4 were achieved through another survey conducted in the same cities. Participants were recruited from the registry of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and from users of hospital services and Methadone Maintenance Treatment clinics. Standard statistical methods were used for validation studies. Results The newly developed PSSHIV and the rearranged version of the Brief COPE were validated and found to have acceptable psychometric properties. Of all participants, 63.3 \% showed moderate/severe depressive symptoms. 'Problem-solving and Acceptance' and 'Self-blame and Denial' were commonly used coping strategies. Socioeconomic status (SES), perceived discrimination, and optimism were significantly associated with overall stress and some of the subscales of PSSHIV. Perceived stress appeared to mediate the relationship between perceived discrimination and psychological well-being. In addition to perceived stress, social support and some particular coping strategies were associated with depression. Similar though not identical results were found using quality of life as the outcome. Conclusions The results showed that depression is prevalent among Chinese PLWH and perceived discrimination is a source of stress. Perceived stress, social support and coping strategies had independent effects on mental health outcomes but there were no interaction effects. The Brief COPE was validated and had a structure different from the original, again supporting the importance of cultural variations. Our results hence provided useful instrumentations (PSSHIV and Brief COPE) as well as a good foundation for the development of theories and interventions specific to the needs of the PLWH in China.

763,Early sleep psychiatric intervention for acute insomnia: Implications from a case of obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Abe, Y.; Nishimura, G.; Endo, T.","Insomnia is a common problem among patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and patients suffering from acute insomnia with psychiatric comorbidity are more likely to develop chronic insomnia without appropriate intervention. Here we report a case of obsessive-compulsive disorder with acute insomnia, successfully treated with early sleep psychiatric non-pharmacological intervention. The augmentation of medication runs a risk of exacerbating daytime impairment. Clinicians usually prescribe medication, such as antidepressants and hypnotics without reflections for such complaints. However, the use of these sedative agents is often problematic, especially when patients have kept a good QOL activity in daily life. The rapid recovery from acute insomnia in this case suggests that the appropriate use of actigraphy is a favorable non-pharmacological intervention in acute insomnia.",2012.0,10.5664/jcsm.1778,APU58JH6,0,cognitive_additional,764
764,Sexual dysfunction among single female survivors of sexual trauma.,"Walters, Amanda M.","Sexual trauma, defined broadly as any unwanted sexual contact, affects a large portion of the female population and can have long-lasting and profound effects on mental health. Sexual trauma and its subsequent mental health sequelae have been found to affect sexual functioning among partnered women. However, not much research has been conducted that considers the effects of mental health sequelae on sexual functioning among single women. Additionally, most of the current research has focused on heterosexual women. This study aimed to assess which mental health and cognitive factors predicted sexual dysfunction, whether certain factors acted protectively against the development of sexual dysfunction, and whether sexual orientation acted as a predictor among single women with sexual trauma histories. Seventy single women participated in this study and five hierarchical multiple regressions were used to test the hypotheses. Post hoc analysis indicated that only large effect sizes would be found, due to the small sample size obtained. Therefore, results that were approaching significance were considered as well. The models predicting overall sexual functioning and arousal most resembled one another. The model predicting sexual pain differed the greatest from the other models -- presumably due to etiological differences. It was found that one of the cognitive factors -- distancing/distraction -- predicted problems with overall sexual functioning, arousal, and orgasm. Depression and anxiety approached significance for these factors. PTSD and shame/guilt approached significance for desire and pain, respectively. Sexual orientation did not significantly predict sexual dysfunction. None of the protective factors were found to significantly protect against the development of sexual dysfunctions. Additionally, a factor analysis was conducted to determine the validity of the Female Sexual Functioning Index (FSFI), given recent changes made to the DSM-5. The factor analysis resulted in a five-factor model that aligned with the current DSM-5 diagnoses for female sexual functioning. It suggests that combining the current desire/arousal and orgasm/arousal subscales would better describe problems with sexual functioning than the current subscales.

E.","The reinforcing properties and subjective effects of alcohol were assessed in 29 normal volunteers using a seven-session choice procedure. On the first four sessions, subjects sampled an alcohol (0.5 g/kg) and a placebo beverage twice each. On three subsequent choice sessions, subjects chose the drink they preferred. The number of times they chose alcohol was the measure of its reinforcing properties. On all sessions subjects completed mood questionnaires before and several times after consuming the beverage. Other dependent measures during the experiment included a cognitive performance task, drug liking and identification questionnaires, and breathalyzer alcohol determinations. Demographic and personality data also were obtained. Approximately one-third of the subjects chose the alcohol-containing beverage on all three choice sessions, one-third alternated in their choices of alcohol and placebo, and one-third consistently chose the placebo. When the subjective effects of alcohol (determined during sampling sessions) were compared across the three choice groups, qualitative differences in response to alcohol were observed. For example, alcohol increased elation and vigor scores in the consistent choosers of alcohol, whereas it decreased scores on these measures in the consistent placebo choosers. Consistent alcohol choosers did not differ from placebo choosers in gender or age but they reported more marijuana use and slightly more alcohol use outside the laboratory. They also scored higher on certain measures of arousal and depression, on the Sensation Seeking Scale and on the Psychopathic State Inventory. The results are discussed in terms of individual differences in vulnerability to excessive use of alcohol.",1987.0,,Z8TGDZKG,0,personality,766

Secondary outcomes included hot flashes (HFs), anxiety, and cognitive complaints. METHODS: Perimenopausal and early postmenopausal women with MDD (N = 27) received 8 weeks of open-label, flexible-dose treatment with vortioxetine. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was the primary outcome measure. Secondary measures included: HF frequency, the Greene Climacteric Scale (GCS), Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MEN-QOL), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (CPFQ), Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and Cogstate testing. RESULTS: Of the 27 women, 24 (88.8%) were evaluated (>= 1 follow-up), and 21 (77.8%) completed the study; 1 discontinued because of adverse effects. The mean MADRS score decreased significantly (P = .0001) from 31.3 (standard deviation [SD] = 5.5) at pretreatment to 8.1 (SD = 7.8) at posttreatment. The depression response rate (>= 50% reduction in MADRS) and remission rate (final MADRS < 10) were 75% and 70.8%, respectively. GCS, MEN-QOL, BAI, CPFQ, and DSST scores improved significantly (P = .0030, P = .0001, P = .0001, P = .0001, and P = .0133, respectively); Cogstate test scores did not. Frequency and severity of HFs improved significantly (P = .0291 and P = .0299, respectively).

H.; Stoltenberg, S. F.; Fitzgerald, H. E.; Zucker, R. A.","Background: Serotonergic (5-HT) dysfunction has been implicated in the etiology of both behavioral disinhibition (BD) and negative affect (NA). This work extends our previous finding of relationships between whole blood 5-HT and both BD and NA in pubescent, but not prepubescent, children of alcoholics and continues examination of a hypothesized role of 5-HT dysfunction in alcoholism risk. The long and short (L and S) variants of the 5-HT transporter gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) are responsible for differing transcriptional efficiencies in 5-HT uptake. Although associations have been found between the SS 5-HTTLPR genotype and severe alcoholism and neuroticism, recent reports describe relationships between the LL genotype and both low level of response to alcohol and alcoholism diagnosis and a predominance of the LL genotype in early-onset alcoholics. Methods: This report is from an ongoing prospective study of the development of risk for alcoholism and other problematic outcomes in a sample of families classified by father's alcoholism subtype. This study examines relationships between 5-HTTLPR genotype and both child BD (Child Behavior Checklist Aggressive Behavior) and NA (Child Behavior Checklist Anxious/Depressed) in offspring from 47 families. Results: Results showed significantly higher levels of BD and NA in the 16 children with the LL genotype than the 46 SS or SL children. Conclusions: Behaviors of undercontrol, which occur at increased rates in children of alcoholics, may be genetically influenced through the regulation of the 5-HT transporter. Due to the small sample size and the preliminary nature of our findings, replication is necessary.",2001.0,,ZAWRVFZ6,0,personality,768

D.; Herrmann, N.; Huo, C. Y.; Anderson, G. M.; Rochon, P. A.","Objective: To determine the prescription pattern and safety profile for irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) in older adults over the past decade. Method: A population-based observational cohort study of older adults was conducted from January 1, 1997, to April 14, 2007, utilizing large administrative health care databases in Ontario, Canada. We examined the prevalence and incidence of irreversible MAOI use, as well as the frequency of coprescribing of MAOIs with contraindicated medications such as serotonergic and sympathomimetic drugs. We reviewed the most responsible diagnosis of emergency department (ED) visits and acute care admissions to assess for serious adverse events that may occur during MAOI treatment (ie, serotonin syndrome and hypertensive crisis). Results: Over a 10-year period, there were 348 new users of irreversible MAOIs. The majority of patients showed a previous treatment pattern consistent with recurrent major depressive disorder, including prior use of antidepressant treatment and electroconvulsive therapy. The yearly incidence of MAOI prescriptions remained low and decreased from a rate of 3.1/100,000 to 1.4/100,000. Concomitant exposure to at least 1 serotonergic drug occurred in 18.1 \% of patients treated with an MAOI. No ED visits or acute care admissions for serotonin syndrome or hypertensive crisis were identified. Conclusions: The low prescription rate of MAOIs is not consistent with the continued recommendation of MAOIs by expert opinion leaders and consensus guidelines for use in atypical depression and treatment-refractory depression. While their use appeared safe, heightened awareness of the potential risk of concomitant use of serotonergic agents is necessary. Relative underuse of the MAOIs for a significant subgroup of depressed patients with atypical and treatment-refractory depression remains a concern. \textcopyright Copyright 2009 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.",2009.0,10.4088/JCP.08m05041blu,K3JIA794,0,diathesis,770

S. Mahler, 1975). Both Ss had similar problems in mothers who had difficulties reading the child's cues and responding to them, and in being optimally available to the child as the separation-individuation process unfolded. In both cases the mothers' difficulties were connected to the child's gender. At age 6.5 mo, the boy responded to inattentiveness by rejecting the mother when she made overtures to him after having ignored him. The girl responded to her mother's inattentiveness by being listless and depressed and waiting and making the most of moments when her mother was accessible. At age 3 yrs the boy experienced prolonged and intense rapprochement and castration struggles and the girl showed an intermingling of rapprochement struggles with early oedipal struggles.

771,"Thoughts without a thinker, mimetic fusing and the anti-container considered as primitive defensive mechanisms in the addictions","Sweet, A. D.","This paper explores certain primitive defensive mechanisms found with addicted patients and introduces one of these, an intra-psychic mechanism, termed mimetic fusing. The descriptive concept of mimetic fusing is introduced in order to illuminate the processes by which a primitive self appears to repeat attempts to assimilate and detoxify introjections that are felt to be threatening and that generate intense anxiety. It is suggested that in the absence of an adequate container (Bion, 1962. A theory of thinking. International Journal of Psycho-Analysis, 43(4-5)), mimetic fusing may develop as a defensive mechanism to assimilate aggressively imbued introjections that threaten to overwhelm a fragile self-structure. The author suggests that mimetic fusing may represent a desperate defensive strategy that ultimately leads to the increased use of other basic defences such as splitting, the anti-container, anti-time and projective identification. Case material, taken from work with an addicted patient in longer term weekly psychotherapy, is included to illustrate the theoretical points under discussion. \textcopyright 2013 Copyright The Association for Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy in the NHS.",2013.0,,33M3372X,0,psychodynamic,772
772,Emotional reactions of heterosexual men to gay imagery.,"Bishop, Cj","Studies of homonegativity in the general population typically use scales to examine the attitudes of a heterosexual sample toward gay men and lesbian women. However, these scales fail to address that accepting gay and lesbian people in theory is not tantamount to accepting the sexual practices engaged in by gay and lesbian people. As a result, relying on homonegativity scales and hypothetical scenarios (i.e., asking a participant to imagine a gay man or lesbian woman from personality characteristics provided) may not offer a complete view of the complexities of homonegativity. To explore this possibility, 83 men self-identifying as either largely or exclusively heterosexual rated one of three groups of images (romantic gay, erotic gay, and control) on the basis of five questions related to their emotional responses. A psychometrically sound homonegativity scale was also completed. Results indicated that homonegativity was a significant predictor of decreased happiness, anger, disgust, task enjoyment, and reported liking of the imagery. Furthermore, homonegativity was found to moderate the association between exposure to the romantic images and four of the five emotional responses (happiness, anger, disgust, and liking). Exposure to the set of erotic gay images, however, was associated with negative emotional responses, regardless of participants' self-reported level of homonegativity (i.e., overt homonegativity possessed less moderational power for this type of imagery). These findings suggest that standard scales of homonegative attitudes may be unable to capture the affective negativity that heterosexual men experience when viewing gay male intimacy.",2015.0,10.1080/00918369.2014.957125,RBJ2CAJP,0,cognitive,773

S.; Zhang, C.; Whiteman, M.; Cohen, P.; Finch, S. J.","The purpose of this study was to identify distinct trajectories of cigarette smoking from ages 14 to 32, and to examine adolescent personality factors that distinguish trajectories of smoking behavior. Participants (N = 975) were randomly selected and followed prospectively since 1975. Follow-up data on cigarette use and personality and behavioral attributes were collected at five points in time, using structured interviews given in private by trained interviewers. Of these subjects, 746 comprised the cohort used in this study. Growth mixture modeling identified five smoking trajectory groups: nonsmokers, occasional smokers, late starters, quitters, and heavy/continuous smokers. Adolescent personality and behavioral risk factors such as lower ego integration, more externalizing behavior, and lower educational aspirations distinguished the trajectory groups. No gender differences were noted. The findings supported the hypotheses indicating multiple distinct trajectory groups of smoking behavior. Smoking behavior appeared in early adolescence and most often continued into adulthood. Emotional difficulties (i.e., lower ego integration), externalizing behavior, and lower educational aspirations in early adolescence were associated both with smoking at an early age and with continuing to smoke into the thirties. To be more effective, smoking prevention programs should target personality and behavioral variations before smoking becomes habitual, particularly focused on characteristics reflecting behavioral problems as manifested in emotional difficulties, externalizing behavior, and low educational aspirations in early adolescence.

E.; Gaynes, B. N.; Feldhousen, E. B.; Newton, E. R.; Bunch, S.; Hollon, S. D.","Introduction: Cognitive-behavioral group interventions have been shown to improve depressive symptoms in adult populations. This article details the feasibility and efficacy of a 6-week, culturally tailored, cognitive-behavioral intervention offered to rural, minority, low-income women at risk for antepartum depression. Methods: A total of 146 pregnant women were stratified by high risk for antepartum depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [EPDS] score of 10 or higher) or by low-moderate risk (EPDS score of 4-9) and randomized to a cognitive-behavioral intervention or treatment as usual. Differences in mean change of EPDS and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)-II scores for low-moderate and high-risk women in the cognitive-behavioral intervention and treatment as usual for the full sample were assessed from baseline (T1), posttreatment (T2), and one-month follow-up (T3), and for African American women in the subsample. Results: Both the cognitive-behavioral intervention and treatment-as-usual groups had significant reductions in the EPDS scores from T1 to T2 and T1 to T3. In women at high risk for depression (n = 62), there was no significant treatment effect from T1 to T2 or T3 for the EPDS. However, in low-moderate risk women, there was a significantly greater mean change in the BDI-II scores from significant decrease in the BDI-II scores from T1 to T2 (4.92 vs 0.59, P = .018) and T1 to T3 (5.67 vs 1.51, P =04). Also, the cognitive-behavioral intervention significantly reduced EPDS scores for African American women at high risk (n = 43) from T1 to T2 (5.59 vs 2.18, P = .02) and from T1 to T3 (6.32 vs 3.14, P =04). Discussion: A cognitive-behavioral intervention integrated within prenatal clinics is feasible in this sample, although attrition rates were high. Compared to treatment as usual, the cognitive-behavioral intervention reduced depressive symptoms for African American women at high risk for antepartum depression and for the full sample of women at low-moderate risk for antepartum depression. These promising findings need to be replicated in a larger controlled clinical trial that incorporates methods to maintain greater participant engagement.",2015.0,,FTBR3AWX,0,behavior,776

Almost 50 \% of the participants reported suffering from pain, with more than one-third rating their pain intensity as moderate or high. Furthermore, nearly half of the study population stated their self-reported health as moderate or poor, and one-fifth reported symptoms of depressed mood. There were discrepancies between the reports of pain or depressed mood and the corresponding use of medication.

777,Predictors of psychological adjustment after bereavement,"Onrust, S.; Cuijpers, P.; Smit, F.; Bohlmeijer, E.","Background: The impact of spousal bereavement on mental health varies among the widowed. More information is needed on factors influencing bereavement outcome. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional study on a sample of 216 widowed individuals. Initial non-response was high, with only 8 \% of all approached persons participating in the study. The influence of demographic and psychosocial predictors on four general outcome measures (depression, anxiety, somatization, and quality of life) and one loss-related outcome (complicated grief) was studied by means of backward linear regression analysis. Further analyses were performed to explore the possibility of a buffer effect. Results: Depressive symptomatology was best predicted by: age, duration of widowhood, perceived non-supportiveness, physical disorders, and mastery. The other outcome measures were predicted by the same predictors supplemented by gender and education. Mastery interacted with the number of physical disorders while perceived social support interacted with duration of widowhood and age. Conclusions: Enhancement of mastery should probably be one of the components of effective support for widowed individuals most vulnerable to psychiatric complications. The widowed could furthermore benefit from social support. Obviously, these suggestions need to be further examined in longitudinal research with more representative samples. \textcopyright 2006 International Psychogeriatric Association.",2007.0,10.1017/S1041610206004248,8XDNCPDW,0,diathesis,778

Depression can precede, coexist or follow the episode of delirium. It was suggested that these two syndromes could share common pathophysiological mechanisms including monoamine transmission and inflammatory reaction. The link between delirium and depression can be seen only in certain populations such as postoperative patients. We aimed to determine association between pre-stroke depression symptoms and risk of post-stroke delirium. Methods: We recruited patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack admitted within 48 hours from symptoms onset. We assessed delirium on a daily basis during the first 7 days of hospitalization. Diagnosis of delirium was based on DSM-5 criteria. We assessed pre-stroke depression symptoms using depression item from Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Results: We included 606 patients (median age: 73, 53% female). We diagnosed delirium in 171 patients (28.2%). In logistic regression, we compared upper quartile of depression score to other quartiles. On univariate analysis, higher score of depression was associated with increased risk of delirium (OR 1.58, 95%CI: 1.04-2.40, P=0.03). However, after adjustment for possible confounders: age, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, stroke severity, prestroke cognitive decline, pre-stroke disability, pneumonia and urinary tract infection, this relation did not remain significant. Conclusion: Pre-stroke depression symptoms are not an independent predictor of delirium in the acute phase of stroke.",2017.0,10.1111/ene.13367,7C3UX9ZI,0,additional,779

C.","In a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we examined participants' engagement with INSPIRE, a personalized online program for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) survivors that focuses on cancer‐related distress, depression, fatigue, and health care needs. We approached all adult, 3‐ to 18‐year HCT survivors treated for hematologic malignancy without relapse or second cancer in the previous 2 years for participation in an RCT with either immediate or delayed access to INSPIRE. Participants with immediate access could view the online material at any time. Data included page view tracking, medical records, and patient‐reported outcomes, including the Short Form 36 and Cancer and Treatment Distress (CTXD) measures. Of 1322 eligible HCT survivors, 771 (58%) completed the baseline assessment, and 451 received immediate INSPIRE access and were included in analyses. The cohort was 56% male, with a mean age of 52 +/‐ 12.2 years, and 26% received an autologous transplant. Most (77%) logged into the INSPIRE site at least once, and 48% viewed >=8 pages. Survivors who viewed >=2 pages were more likely to be age >=40 years (relative risk [RR], 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10 to 1.80), to be female (RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.40), to have chronic graft‐versus‐host disease (RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.51), to be less than 10 years post‐HCT (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.39), and to have moderate CTXD distress (RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.57). Engagement did not differ by race, education, income, rural/urban residence, computer experience, donor type, or depression (all P >=.50).

E.; Rosen, M. P.; Cedars, M. I.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine psychological factors in relation to antral follicle count (AFC), a marker of ovarian reserve, in a multiethnic sample of 683 premenopausal women in the Ovarian Aging (OVA) Study. METHODS: In cross-sectional analyses, linear regression was performed to determine whether AFC decline across women varied over levels of depression as well as depression in combination with psychological stress. The total and subscale scores of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale were used to measure depression, and the Perceived Stress Scale was used to measure psychological stress. RESULTS: After covariate adjustment, the two-way interaction of age × positive affect and the three-way interaction of age × positive affect × stress were related to AFC (b = 0.047, P = 0.036; b = 0.012, P = 0.099, respectively). In stratified analyses, stress was related to AFC in women with low positive affect (b =-0.070, P = 0.021) but not in women with high positive affect (b = 0.018, P = 0.54). AFC decline across women was progressively higher in women with low positive affect who reported low (-0.747 follicles/year), mid (-0.920 follicles/year), and high (-1.112 follicles/year) levels of stress. Results examining the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale total and remaining subscale scores were all nonsignificant (P values \textgreater 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Cross-sectional evidence suggests that (1) women with low positive affect may experience accelerated AFC decline and (2) low positive affect may be a vulnerability factor, or, alternatively, high positive affect may be a protective factor, in moderating the negative effects of psychological stress on AFC decline.

These include: personal psychological history, interpersonal/marital correlates, stress-based correlates, and chronicity as a factor. The sample selection methods of previous research populations are critiqued. The preeminent risk factors previously established using research criteria to define the Postpartum Depression population were examined in a clinical sample of 19 outpatients diagnosed with clinical depression with postpartum onset and 18 normal postpartum subjects. Subjects completed a questionnaire that included demographic data, the Childcare Stress Scale (CSS), the Marital Adjustment Test (MAT), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and items concerning previous subclinical and clinical mental-health problems. None of the previously demonstrated predictors were significantly correlated with the clinical group except previously treated depression in the subject. An incidental finding was that clinically depressed subjects were more likely than normals to have planned to stay home for longer than four months following the baby's birth. The implications of these findings, both in regard to Postpartum Depression research and depression in general, are discussed.

783,Elevated C-reactive protein in depression: A predictor of good long-term outcome with antidepressants and poor outcome with psychotherapy.,"Harley, J.; Luty, S.; Carter, J.; Mulder, R.; Joyce, P.","Depression has been associated with elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). CRP is synthesized in and released from the liver in response to pro inflammatory cytokines, and the concentration of CRP is used as an index of inflammation. Using CRP levels, we compared the treatment outcomes of depressed patients who were defined as having inflammation with those who did not show evidence of acute inflammation. Treatment outcomes were examined in two consecutively recruited samples of depressed patients; one a randomized trial of nortriptyline and fluoxetine and the other a randomized trial of interpersonal psychotherapy. CRP results were available for 178 of the 195 patients in the antidepressant study and 168 of the 177 patients in the psychotherapy trial. The psychotherapy trial was structured to involve 8-19 sessions of either interpersonal psychotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapy over a 16-week period. We chose a comparable time, 20 weeks after initial randomization to antidepressants, for the other trial. The multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant interaction between CRP status and treatment received. In a second cohort of patients treated with psychotherapy, the outcome of patients with elevated CRP was poorer. We have identified elevated CRP as a candidate peripheral biomarker for good long-term outcome after treatment with antidepressants. In a second cohort of patients treated with psychotherapy, the outcome of patients with elevated CRP was poorer. This indicates the existence of a subgroup of depressed patients that antidepressant medication is preferable to psychotherapy. These patients could be identified using CRP concentrations, an assay that is cheap and is routinely performed by hospital and community health laboratories.

785,Seasonal severity of depressive symptoms as a predictor of health service use in a community-based sample.,"Vigod, Simone N.; Levitt, Anthony J.","OBJECTIVE: To determine whether severity of seasonal depressive symptoms is an independent predictor of depression-specific health service use. METHODS: Cross-sectional telephone survey evaluating mood-related symptom changes across seasons using a structured interview based on the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview, in a community sample representative of the province of Ontario, Canada (N = 1605). This study focuses on the 625 individuals (out of a total of 1605 interviewed) who screened positive for lifetime depressive symptoms. Severity of seasonal symptoms of depression (or seasonality ) was measured using the Seasonal Depression Severity (SDS) score (range 0-36). The primary outcome was lifetime depression-specific use of health services from a physician (family physician or psychiatrist). Lifetime psychotropic medication use, use of health services from a non-physician therapist, and psychiatric hospitalization were secondary outcomes. Other important variables that are known to predict depression-specific health service use were considered in multivariable analysis. RESULTS: In our sample of individuals with depressive symptoms, those who had used physician health services had higher SDS scores than non-users (11.5 (SD 7.2) vs. 9.7 (SD 6.4), t(616) = 3.182, P = 0.001). In multivariable analysis, SDS score was independently associated with depression-specific health service use by a physician (OR = 1.04, 95 \% CI 1.01-1.07, p = 0.004). The relationship between seasonality and use of psychotropic medication use was similar (OR = 1.04, 95 \% CI 1.01-1.07, p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Seasonality was independently associated with depression-specific health service use for individuals with depressive symptoms. The results imply that greater seasonality may independently reflect increased severity and need for treatment of depression.",2011.0,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2010.10.004,62XTB5E8,0,cognitive_additional,786

The mean daily dosage of thiothixene hydrochloride in the final week of the study was 8.7 mg, a lower dosage than is used in outpatient schizophrenics. Significant drug-placebo differences were found, regardless of diagnosis, on illusions, ideas of reference, psychoticism, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and phobic anxiety, but not on depression. Thiothixene seems to have more than an antipsychotic effect. Since response to treatment studies are a means for reformulating diagnostic concepts, we suggest a subdiagnosis defined by those symptoms that are drug-responsive, some of which are not included in current diagnostic criteria. Patients with borderline and schizotypal disorder without the foregoing symptoms probably would not profit from thiothixene and might needlessly be placed at risk for adverse drug effects.",1986.0,,HAIP6G4K,0,personality,788

790,A systematic review of the role of the brief behavioural intervention in the management of chronic pain,"Yashpal, N.; Harmon, D.","Introduction: As physicians, one of our biggest challenges is affecting long term change in patient behaviour. A brief behavioural intervention (BI) is designed to modify and affect a patient's actions with their own health in mind. This is different to the traditional model of change where a direct intervention, is provided to the patient. BI's have a proven role in behaviour change e.g. smoking cessation and their efficacy in the primary care setting is established through studies examining risk reduction for Cardiovascular Disease. This model of change may be applicable to chronic pain. Aim of investigation: We aim to assess the effect of the BI on patient behaviours and self reported pain scores. Methods: We performed an electronic search of PubMed, EBSCOhost, Cochrane Library and Ovid Online databases. Inclusion criteria: English language, randomized control trials, evaluation of chronic pain as an outcome. Exclusion criteria: none. Results: One trial met our criteria (n = 284), and compared the difference between a Multidisciplinary Approach Model and BI for self reported pain scores. Length of time for participants to return to work was their primary endpoint, and they found similar results in both trial arms. Conclusions: While the literature on BI in chronic pain is limited, there is evidence of its efficacy in domains outside of pain that involve endpoints in chronic pain co‐morbidities, including depression and post‐traumatic stress disorder. In this instance, there is evidence that BI is as effective as a multidisciplinary model. Further studies need to examine baseline patient characteristics (moderators) and during treatment factors (mediators), and their effects on efficacy of brief interventions in the chronic pain setting.",2017.0,10/ghbqdg,VUSK7JJL,0,additional,791
791,Trauma and the soul: A psycho-spiritual approach to human development and its interruption.,"Kalsched, Donald","In Trauma and the Soul, Donald Kalsched continues die exploration he began in his first book, The Inner World of Trauma (1996)-this time going further into the mystical or spiritual moments that often occur around the intimacies of psychoanalytic work. Through extended clinical vignettes, including therapeutic dialogue and dreams, he shows how depth psychotherapy with trauma's survivors can open both analytic partners to another world of non-ordinary reality in which daimonic powers reside, both light and dark. This mytho-poetic world, he suggests, is not simply a defensive product of our struggle with the harsh realties of living as Freud suggested, but is an everlasting fact of human experience-a mystery that is often at the very center of the healing process, and yet at other times, strangely resists it. With these two worlds in focus, Kalsched explores a variety of themes as he builds, chapter by chapter, an integrated psycho-spiritual approach to trauma and its treatment including: 1) Images of the lost soul-child in dreams and how this child represents an essential core of aliveness that is both protected and persecuted by the psyche's defenses; 2) Dante's guided descent into the Inferno of Hell as a paradigm for the psychotherapy process and its inevitable struggle with self-destructive energies; 3) Childhood innocence and its central role in a person's spiritual life, seen through the story of St. Exupery's The Little Prince; 4) How clinical attention to implicit processes in the relational field, as well as discoveries in body-based affective neuroscience are making trauma treatment more effective; 5) the life of C.G. Jung as it portrays his early trauma, his soul's retreat into an inner sanctuary, and his gradual recovery of wholeness through the integration of his divided self. This is a book that restores the mystery to psychoanalytic work. It tells stories of ordinary patients and ordinary psychotherapists who, through working together, glimpse the reality of the human soul and the depth of the spirit, and are changed by the experience. Trauma and the Soul will be of particular interest to practicing psychotherapists, psychoanalysts, analytical psychologists, and expressive arts therapists, including those with a spiritual orientation.

793,Maternal attachment: Associations with diabetes and psychosocial adjustment during adolescence.,"Korbel, Carolyn D.","The goal of this research was to understand how adolescent maternal attachment was associated with type 1 diabetes and psychosocial adjustment among 11- to 16-year-olds with diabetes. Understanding the factors that facilitate positive diabetes (i.e. adherence and metabolic control) and psychosocial adjustment (i.e. symptoms of depression) is critical as adherence and metabolic control typically deteriorate during adolescence. One hundred adolescents completed measures of attachment, adherence, depression, parental diabetes responsibility, and emotion regulation. Metabolic control data were gathered from medical records. Results indicated that maternal attachment was consistently associated with depression. Attachment security was associated with lower levels of depression, while both attachment anxiety and avoidance were associated with higher levels of depression. Attachment anxiety was associated with poorer metabolic control and marginally poorer levels of adherence. Attachment avoidance was marginally associated with poorer adherence, but an interaction with age revealed this occurred for younger participants. Mediation analyses were conducted to explore potential mechanisms for these associations. Although attachment representations were associated with parental diabetes responsibility such that mothers were more involved among those with greater attachment anxiety and less involved among those with greater attachment avoidance, diabetes responsibility did not mediate associations with adjustment. Attachment representations were also associated with expected patterns of emotion-regulation. Secure attachment was associated with lower autonomic reactivity, less suppression of emotions, and greater use of cognitive analysis and positive reframing for coping. Attachment anxiety was associated with greater autonomic reactivity and slower falling reactivity, without any evidence of heightened emotional or cognitive regulation tendencies to buffer such reactivity. Avoidant attachment was not significantly correlated with any emotion regulation strategy. Autonomic reactivity mediated associations between anxious attachment and depression, although no other emotion-regulation variable was found to mediate associations between attachment representations and adjustment. Findings support the importance of the mother-adolescent attachment relationship in type 1 diabetes management during adolescence.

794,"The relationship between interpersonal problems, therapeutic alliance, and outcomes following group and individual cognitive behaviour therapy","McEvoy, P. M.; Burgess, M. M.; Nathan, P.","Background Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is efficacious, but there remains individual variability in outcomes. Patient's interpersonal problems may affect treatment outcomes, either directly or through a relationship mediated by helping alliance. Interpersonal problems may affect alliance and outcomes differentially in individual and group (CBGT) treatments. The main aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between interpersonal problems, alliance, dropout and outcomes for a clinical sample receiving either individual or group CBT for anxiety or depression in a community clinic. Methods Patients receiving individual CBT (N=84) or CBGT (N=115) completed measures of interpersonal problems, alliance, and disorder specific symptoms at the commencement and completion of CBT. Results In CBGT higher pre-treatment interpersonal problems were associated with increased risk of dropout and poorer outcomes. This relationship was not mediated by alliance. In individual CBT those who reported higher alliance were more likely to complete treatment, although alliance was not associated with symptom change, and interpersonal problems were not related to attrition or outcome. Limitations Allocation to group and individual therapy was non-random, so selection bias may have influenced these results. Some analyses were only powered to detect large effects. Helping alliance ratings were high, so range restriction may have obscured the relationship between helping alliance, attrition and outcomes. Conclusions Pre-treatment interpersonal problems increase risk of dropout and predict poorer outcomes in CBGT, but not in individual CBT, and this relationship is not mediated by helping alliance. Stronger alliance is associated with treatment completion in individual, but not group CBT. \ \textcopyright \ 2014 Elsevier B.V.",2014.0,,MKS3CFKE,0,behavior,795

However, the effect of employment and marriage on psychosocial functioning has been studied predominantly in healthy subjects. We investigated whether work and marital status are associated with depressive symptoms, social support, and daily stress behavior in women with coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods: Data of 105 women with CAD and of working age were analyzed. General linear models were used to determine the association between work and marital status and depressive symptoms, social support, and daily stress behavior. Results: Women who were working at the time of measurement had lower levels of depressive symptoms (7.0 ± 1.2 vs. 12.1 ± 0.9, p \textless 0.01) and higher levels of social support (21.6 ± 1.0 vs. 18.9 ± 0.7, p = 0.03) than the nonworking women, whereas marital status was not related to any of the outcome variables. Results were similar after adjusting for potential confounders, that is, age, education, self-reported health, and risk factors for CAD. There was no significant interaction between marital status and working status on depressive symptoms, social support, or daily stress behavior. Conclusions: In women with CAD, all \textless 65 years of age, after a cardiac event, patients working had lower levels of depressive symptoms and a better social integration than those not working, regardless of reason for being nonemployed. Daily stress behavior, depression, and social support did not differ between cohabiting and not cohabiting women. Future interventions should take into consideration that women with CAD who are unemployed may have a higher risk for depression and social isolation and, therefore, poor clinical outcomes. \textcopyright 2007 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",2007.0,10.1089/jwh.2006.0191,2T9AGWZW,0,diathesis,796

Essau (see record 2009-08717-000). Depression in adolescents has often been overlooked by parents and mental health professionals alike, and identifying effective treatments for adolescent depression has been difficult. Essau's latest edited volume reviews treatments for adolescent depression and is likely to be welcomed by mental health practitioners who work with this population. The book is divided into five parts, covering such topics as epidemiological and diagnostic issues; cognitive-behavioral therapies and related approaches; and family interventions, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and pharmacotherapy. The book concludes with a discussion of progress and unresolved issues in the treatment of adolescent depression. Overall, this volume is quite satisfying, and psychologists are likely to find much to like. However, there are some weaknesses. For example, while some treatment approaches are explained in much detail, others are covered in only a brief overview. In addition, the book appears to focus on treatments mostly applicable to mild-to-moderate levels of depression. On balance, however, Treatments for adolescent depression works well and is likely to be a welcome addition to the library of any psychologist who works with teenagers.

There is little research into post, exile factors that may be amenable to change, and therefore reduce morbidity. We examined the importance of social factors in exile and of trauma factors in producing the different elements of psychological sequelae of severe trauma. Method: Eighty-four male Iraqi refugees were interviewed. Adverse events and level of social support were measured. Various measures of psychological morbidity were applied, all of which have been used in previous trauma research. Results: Social factors in exile, particularly the level of 'affective' social support, proved important in determining the severity of both post-traumatic stress disorder and depressive reactions, particularly when combined with a severe level of trauma/torture.

800,Effect of gender on suicide attempters versus nonattempters in an adolescent inpatient unit.,"Fennig, Silvana; Geva, Keren; Zalzman, Gil; Weitzman, Abraham; Fennig, Shmuel; Apter, Alan","Background: Although gender differences have been noted in the risk factors for suicide and attempted suicide, comparative studies to date have used only 2 groups and a limited number of measures. The present study compared the effect of gender on suicide among 4 groups of psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents using a cross-sectional design. Methods: The study sample consisted of 404 patients, aged between 12 and 21, who were divided into 4 groups: 76 male suicide attempters, 103 male nonattempters, 143 female suicide attempters, and 82 female nonattempters. Patients were tested for life events, affective disorders, aggression, impulsivity, ego defense mechanisms, and death perception with the Child Suicide Potential Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Overt Aggression Scale, Multidimensional Anger Inventory, Impulsivity Control Scale, and Life Style Index. Findings were analyzed by multivariate regression with stepwise logistic models. Results: Depression and anxiety were more prevalent in female nonattempters than in male nonattempters; there were no such gender differences among the attempters. Antisocial behavior was more prevalent in male attempters than in female attempters; there were no gender differences on this aspect among the nonattempters. There were gender differences for defense mechanisms in the attempters. Logistic regression models for men and women separately revealed that antisocial behavior and anxiety were common predictors of suicide attempt, that destructiveness was a predictor in women only, and that depression was associated with suicide attempt in men only. Conclusions: Suicide-prone female and male adolescent inpatients show distinct differences in psychopathology, ego defense mechanisms, and life events compared to psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents without any history of suicide attempt. Any deviation from a gender-specific behavior must raise suspicion of a risk of attempted suicide. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",,,Z4VU5X48,0,cognitive,801
801,Sociotropy-autonomy and interpersonal problems.,"Sato, Toru; McCann, Doug","Sociotropy and autonomy are conceptualized as two personality dimensions that relate to an individual's vulnerability to depression. Sociotropy is characterized as an excessive investment in interpersonal relationships, and autonomy is characterized as an excessive concern with personal achievement and control. This study examined the relationships between sociotropy and autonomy, and a variety of interpersonal problems with close and nonclose others. Results suggested that sociotropic individuals are overly nurturant to nonclose others but vindictive to individuals who are close to them. In contrast, autonomous individuals were found to be domineering to nonclose others but socially avoidant toward people close to them. These findings are discussed in the context of recent research regarding the interpersonal patterns associated with sociotropy and autonomy.",2007.0,10.1002/da.20230,IX36P2ME,0,personality,802
802,Functioning before and after a major depressive episode: pre-existing vulnerability or scar? A prospective three-wave population-based study,"Bos, E. H.; Ten Have, M.; van Dorsselaer, S.; Jeronimus, B. F.; de Graaf, R.; de Jonge, P.","BACKGROUND: The vulnerability hypothesis suggests that impairments after remission of depressive episodes reflect a pre-existing vulnerability, while the scar hypothesis proposes that depression leaves residual impairments that confer risk of subsequent episodes. We prospectively examined vulnerability and scar effects in mental and physical functioning in a representative Dutch population sample. METHODS: Three waves were used from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2, a population-based study with a 6-years follow-up. Mental and physical functioning were assessed with the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-36). Major depressive disorder (MDD) was assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0. Vulnerability effects were examined by comparing healthy controls (n = 2826) with individuals who developed a first-onset depressive episode during first follow-up but did not have a lifetime diagnosis of MDD at baseline (n = 181). Scarring effects were examined by comparing pre- and post-morbid functioning in individuals who developed a depressive episode after baseline that was remitted at the third wave (n = 108). RESULTS: Both mental (B = -5.4, s.e. = 0.9, p < 0.001) and physical functioning (B = -8.2, s.e. = 1.1, p < 0.001) at baseline were lower in individuals who developed a first depressive episode after baseline compared with healthy controls. This effect was most pronounced in people who developed a severe episode. No firm evidence of scarring in mental or physical functioning was found. In unadjusted analyses, physical functioning was still lowered post-morbidly (B = -5.1, s.e. = 2.1, p = 0.014), but this effect disappeared in adjusted analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Functional impairments after remission of depression seem to reflect a pre-existing vulnerability rather than a scar.",2018.0,10.1017/s0033291717003798,WR9F6T9C,0,additional,803
803,Managing inadequate antidepressant response in depressive illness.,"Haddad, Peter M.; Talbot, Peter S.; Anderson, Ian M.; McAllister-Williams, R. Hamish","INTRODUCTION OR BACKGROUND: Depression frequently fails to respond to initial treatment. SOURCES OF DATA: Predominantly meta-analyses and RCTs but supplemented where necessary by additional data and the authors' clinical experience. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: A systematic assessment to identify remedial causes of poor response should be followed by planned sequential treatment trials. Joint decision making by the patient and clinician is essential. Strategies with the strongest support are antidepressant augmentation with lithium or second generation antipsychotics and adding cognitive behavioural treatment. Electroconvulsive therapy is highly effective in resistant depression but there is a high relapse rate when treatment ends. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Some pharmacological strategies have inconsistent data (e.g. antidepressant combinations, T3 augmentation) or limited preliminary data (e.g. ketamine, antidepressant augmentation with pramipexole). The efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation, deep brain stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is unclear. GROWING POINTS: A greater understanding of the causes of depression may assist the development of more effective treatments. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Role of glutamate antagonists and psychological treatments, other than cognitive behavioural therapy, as adjunctive treatments.",2015.0,10.1093/bmb/ldv034,9UJCNWN5,0,cognitive,804

Following a baseline EEG recording, participants were asked to continuously rate their discomfort while looking at affective pictures, as well as for a period of time after exposure. Greater spontaneous beta band power in parietal locations, lower frontal and parietal delta/beta ratios, and lower parietal theta/beta ratio were associated with lower ratings of discomfort after the offset of unpleasant pictures. Moreover, lower parietal delta/beta ratio was also related to less time needed to recover from discomfort after exposure to aversive pictures, while only a greater frontal and parietal alpha band power appeared to be associated with faster recovery from discomfort induced by normative-neutral pictures. However, parietal delta/beta ratio was the only predictor of both minimum discomfort ratings and time needed to downregulate following exposure to unpleasant pictures, and frontal alpha band power the only spontaneous EEG index that predicted variability in spontaneous down-regulation after the exposure to normative-neutral pictures. Results are discussed focusing on the utility of diverse spontaneous EEG measures in several cortical regions when capturing trait-like individual differences in emotion regulation capabilities and processes.",2014.0,10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2014.09.003,IDDPT49A,0,cognitive_additional,806
806,Maternal prenatal anxiety and downregulation of placental 11$\beta$-HSD2,"O'Donnell, K. J. and","Background: Raised maternal anxiety during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes for her child. The mechanisms underlying this are not known but animal studies suggest prenatal stress may alter the function of the placenta. Here we determined whether maternal prenatal anxiety was associated with a downregulation of placental 11$\beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11$\beta$-HSD2), the enzyme which metabolises cortisol. Methods: We recruited mothers the day before delivery by elective caesarean, and gave them the Spielberger Trait and State anxiety and Edinburgh Depression self-rating scales. Placentae were collected and aliquots stored for later analysis. Results: Prenatal Trait anxiety was negatively correlated with placental 11$\beta$-HSD2 mRNA expression (r= -0.40, p \textless 0.01, n= 56). Results were similar with male and female fetuses (r= -0.39, p= 0.04, n= 28; r= -0.40, p= 0.03, n= 28) respectively. Results were also significant with State anxiety (r= -0.27, p= 0.05, n= 56) but somewhat weaker for depression (r= -0.20, p= 0.13, n= 56). Preliminary analyses on a subset of cases (n= 25) suggested parallel results for enzyme activity. Conclusions: These findings provide evidence for an association between prenatal maternal mood and downregulation of placental 11$\beta$-HSD2. Results are consistent with raised maternal anxiety being associated with increased fetal exposure to maternal cortisol, and support the hypothesis that this may be one mechanism underlying fetal programming by prenatal stress. \textcopyright 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",2012.0,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2011.09.014,R9MIDA72,0,diathesis,807

808,Impact of an electronic cigarette on smoking reduction and cessation in schizophrenic smokers: a prospective 12-month pilot study.,"Caponnetto, P.; Auditore, R.; Russo, C.; Cappello, G. C.; Polosa, R.; P, Caponnetto; R, Auditore; C, Russo; Gc, Cappello; R, Polosa","Background: Cigarette smoking is a tough addiction to break. This dependence is the most common dual diagnosis for individuals with schizophrenia. Currently three effective drugs are approved for smoking cessation: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline and bupropion. However, some serious side effects of varenicline have been reported, including depression, suicidal thoughts, and suicide. The use of bupropion also has side effects. It should not be used by people who have epilepsy or any condition that lowers the seizure threshold, nor by people who take a specific class of drugs called monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Hence, there are pharmacodynamic reason to believe they could precipitate or exacerbate psychosis. For its capacity to deliver nicotine and provide a coping mechanism for conditioned smoking cues by replacing some of the rituals associated with smoking gestures, electronic-cigarettes may reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms without serious side effects. Our recent work with ECs in healthy smokers not intending to quit consistently show surprisingly high success rates. We hypothesised that these positive findings could be replicated in difficult patients with schizophrenia This tool may help smokers with schizophrenia remain abstinent during their quitting attempts or to reduce cigarette consumption. Efficacy and safety of these devices in long-term smoking cessation and/or smoking reduction studies have never been investigated for this special population. Methods: In this study we monitored possible modifications in smoking habits of smokers (not intending to quit) with schizophrenia experimenting with the Categoria e-Cigarette with a focus on smoking reduction and smoking abstinence. Study participants were invited to attend six study visits: at baseline, week-4, week-8, week-12 week-24 and week 52. Product use, number of cigarettes smoked, carbon monoxide in exhaled breath (eCO) and positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia levels were measured at each visit. Smoking reduction and abstinence rates were calculated. Adverse events were also reviewed. Results: Sustained 50 \% reduction in the number of cig/day at week-52 was shown in 7/14 (50 \% ) participants; their median of 30 cig/day decreasing significantly to cig/day (p = 0.018). Sustained smoking abstinence at week-52 was observed in 2/14 (14.3 \% ) participants. Combined sustained 50 \% reduction and smoking abstinence was shown in 9/14 (64.3 \% ) participants. Nausea was observed in 2/14 (14.4 \% ) of participants, throat irritation in 2/14 (14.4 \% ) of participants, headache in 2/14 (14.4 \% ) of participants, and dry cough in 4/14 (28.6 \% ) of participants. However, these adverse events diminished substantially by week-24. Overall, one to two cartridges/day were used throughout the study. Positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia are not increased after smoking reduction/cessation in patients using e-cigarettes. Conclusions: We have shown for the first time that the use of e-cigarette substantially decreased cigarette consumption without causing significant side effects in chronic schizophrenic patients who smoke not intending to quit. This was achieved without negative impacts on the symptoms of schizophrenia as assessed by SAPS and SANS symptoms scales. \textcopyright 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2013.0,10.3390/ijerph10020446,84KSN95N,0,diathesis,809
809,Patterns in contextual risk factors for parent problem solving and child behavior: A test of a mediational model for the relation between parent risk factors and child behavior.,"McElroy, Heather Kayle","Social-cognitive problem solving deficits are associated with numerous parent risk factors that are also directly related to child behavior problems such as parent depressive symptoms, life stress, and socioeconomic status. There is also evidence to suggest that parent problem solving in interactions with other adults is related to childhood aggression and behavior problems. The purpose of this study was to examine the possible mediation of parent problem solving in the relation between parent contextual risk factors and teacher rated child behavior problems. Measures of social cognitive problem solving (Means End Problem Solving), depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory), life stress (Life Events), socioeconomic status (Hollingshead Index), and behavior problems (BASC, TOCA, Proactive Reactive Aggression) were collected from a sample of 240 4 th grade male and female parent-child dyads weighted for aggressive behavior. The study hypothesized that parent functioning and contextual risk factors (depressive symptoms, life stress, and socioeconomic status) would significantly correlate with one another and predict both child conduct problems and aggressive behavior. In addition, parent problem solving would partially mediate the relation between parent functioning and contextual factors and child behavior. Results from correlation and regression analyses indicate that the parent risk factors examined are interrelated. Parent depressive symptoms did not relate to aggressive behavior, but were significantly related to child conduct problems. However, when included together in a regression model, socioeconomic status emerged as the most significant predictor of externalizing problems. Although parent problem solving was not related to the risk factors, problem solving predicted aggressive behavior and remained a significant predictor of teacher-rated aggression even when included in a model with the other examined risk factor. Parent problem solving did not serve as a mediator in this study; however, this study adds significantly to the problem solving and aggression literature by suggesting that parent problem solving may be an additional risk factor in child aggressive behavior. Clinically, intervention and prevention programs may consider the inclusion of problem solving training in parent therapy.

810,Getting a knack for nac: N-acetyl-cysteine,"Sansone, R. A.; Sansone, L. A.","N-acetyl-cysteine, Nacetylcysteine, N-acetyl cysteine, and N-acetyl-L-cysteine are all designations for the same compound, which is abbreviated as NAC. NAC is a precursor to the amino acid cysteine, which ultimately plays two key metabolic roles. Through its metabolic contribution to glutathione production, cysteine participates in the general antioxidant activities of the body. Through its role as a modulator of the glutamatergic system, cysteine influences the reward-reinforcement pathway. Because of these functions, NAC may exert a therapeutic effect on psychiatric disorders allegedly related to oxidative stress (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) as well as psychiatric syndromes characterized by impulsive/compulsive symptoms (e.g., trichotillomania, pathological nail biting, gambling, substance misuse). While the dosages, pharmacological strategies (monotherapy versus augmentation), and long-term risks are not fully evident, NAC appears to be a promising, relatively low-risk intervention. If so, NAC might be an ideal treatment strategy for a variety of psychiatric conditions in both psychiatric and primary care settings.",2011.0,,HUNI6GAP,0,behavior,811

In Studies 1 and 2, women low in anxiety sensitivity used more acceptance coping strategies and women high in anxiety sensitivity reported using more maladaptive coping strategies. In Study 2, women with medium anxiety sensitivity reported similar coping strategies to women low in anxiety. Menstrual cycle phase did not differentially affect coping strategy use in women varying in anxiety sensitivity levels in Studies 1 and 2. In addition to depressed mood emerging as a significant predictor of premenstrual distress in these two studies for all participants, avoidance coping for women high in anxiety sensitivity and problem-focused coping for women low in anxiety sensitivity were also significant predictors of premenstrual distress. In Study 3, during the premenstrual phase, women with panic disorder, compared to controls, reported using more avoidance coping whereas controls reported used more active coping and seeking social support for emotional and instrumental reasons. Results are discussed within a continuity model from high anxiety sensitivity to anxiety disorder for maladaptive coping and menstrual distress.",2004.0,10.1016/S0887-6185(02)00243-8,RFTIK9XC,0,cognitive_additional,812
812,Antidepressant discontinuation associated with cognitive decline in older adult residents of long-term care facilities,"Streim, J. E.; Filippo, S.; Have, T.; Mavandadi, S.; Weintraub, D.; Oslin, D.","Introduction: More than one third of older adults residing in long term care facilities take antidepressants, the majority of whom are receiving maintenance treatment for a single episode of late-life depression. However, there is a lack of evidence to support this practice, and mounting evidence for adverse effects, especially falls and cognitive decline, with antidepressant treatment in the elderly. This study examined potential benefits and adverse effects of antidepressant drug continuation versus discontinuation in this population. Methods: Partially randomized, open-label, 12-month prospective study of elderly long-term care residents who were randomly assigned or chose to continue versus discontinue antidepressant medication. Subjects were recruited from nursing homes and assisted living facilities within a 30-mile radius of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Sample consisted of 94 adults, 60-95 years of age, ambulatory, cognitively intact or with mild-moderate impairment but capable of self-report of depression symptoms, receiving antidepressant treatment for a single episode of depression, and in full remission for at least six months. Primary outcomes were change in depression and cognition measured by Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) score and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, respectively; and number of falls per week. Longitudinal, generalized estimating equations were used to assess trajectories of change across groups. Results: In both the randomized and preference samples, as well as the combined sample, the longitudinal analyses did not show any significant between-group (antidepressant continuation vs. discontinuation) 12-month differences in GDS score or number of falls, though patterns of change varied in direction and magnitude between groups. However, the discontinuation group showed a greater decrease in cognitive function than the continuation group in the preference and combined samples. In the preference sample, the discontinuation group showed a significant overall decline of -0.27 MMSE units per week (95 \% CI= (-0.48, -0.06); SE=0.11; df=441 t=-2.55; p=0.01), whereas the continuation group was associated with a non-significant decline of -0.10 MMSE units per week (95 \% CI=(-0.45, 0.26); SE=0.18; df=441; t=- 0.54; p=0.60). In the combined sample, the results paralleled the preference sample with a significant decreasing slope of -0.26 MMSE units per week (95 \% CI=(-0.47, -0.04); SE=0.11; df=719; t=-2.33; p=0.02) in the discontinuation group compared with a non-significant decline of -0.12 (95 \% CI=-0.33,0.10); SE=0.11; df=719; t=-1.06; p=0.29) in the continuation group. Differences between the continuation and discontinuation slopes were not significant in any of the samples for MMSE. Conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the overall risks and benefits of maintenance antidepressant therapy for single-episode late-life depression, but preliminary results suggest an association between antidepressant discontinuation and decline in cognitive function among elderly residents of long-term care facilities.",2012.0,10.1097/01.JGP.0000413064.91948.aa,M3B7UQ6X,0,cognitive,813
813,Experiencing a dilemma--accounts of working with PND.,"McConnell, J.; Baker, M.; Marks, L.","Various ways of thinking about postnatal depression (PND) are evident from the literature. From the clinical-medical perspective, it is an illness of the individual mother. The social approach locates its cause in the environment Feminists/social constructionists have critiqued such models as problematising women--they see them as pressured by oppressive forces such as society's stereotype of 'the joy of motherhood'. From the psychoanalytic perspective it arises from unrecognised conflict and ambivalence, related to the re-emergence of conflict between the mother and her own parents. Health visitors working with PND--the frontline of health professionals in this aspect of maternal mental health--stand between the professional/academic accounts on the one hand, and the lay accounts of their clients on the other. The aim of this study was to examine how health visitors understand and make sense of PND. We adopted qualitative research methodology to analyse transcripts from interviews with eight health visitors about their work with PND. The findings demonstrate the diverse roles they have to adopt, and the complexity and lack of clarity of the very concept of PND itself. There were clearly ambiguities and dilemmas of thinking involved--not apparent from the literature, tensions with which the participants struggled.

This paper reviews the findings from two 2016 surveys conducted through the American Psychiatric Association publication the Psychiatric Times and via a member survey by the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry (AAGP). METHODS: We present the results of the two surveys in terms of descriptive frequencies and percentages and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches to late-life TRD. RESULTS: The Psychiatric Times survey received 468 responses, and the AAGP survey received 117 responses, giving an overall sample of 585 responses. The majority (76.3%) of respondents from both groups believed that a large randomized study comparing the risks and benefits of augmentation and switching strategies for TRD in patients aged 60 years and older would be helpful, and 80% of clinicians believed their practice would benefit from the findings of such a study. Of the treatment strategies that need evidence of efficacy, the most popular options were augmentation/combination strategies, particularly augmentation with aripiprazole (58.7%), bupropion (55.0%), and lithium (50.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Late-life TRD constitutes a large proportion of clinical practices, particularly of geriatric psychiatry, with lacking evidence of efficacy of most treatment strategies. These surveys indicate a clear need for a large randomized study that compares risks and benefits of augmentation and switching strategies.",2017.0,10.1016/j.jagp.2016.05.010,4KD6QPT6,0,diathesis,816

K.; Stockdale, S.; Ramos, E.; Belin, T. R.; Miranda, J.","BACKGROUND: Depression contributes to disability and there are ethnic/racial disparities in access and outcomes of care. Quality improvement (QI) programs for depression in primary care improve outcomes relative to usual care, but health, social and other community-based service sectors also support clients in under-resourced communities. Little is known about effects on client outcomes of strategies to implement depression QI across diverse sectors. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of Community Engagement and Planning (CEP) and Resources for Services (RS) to implement depression QI on clients' mental health-related quality of life (HRQL) and services use. DESIGN: Matched programs from health, social and other service sectors were randomized to community engagement and planning (promoting inter-agency collaboration) or resources for services (individual program technical assistance plus outreach) to implement depression QI toolkits in Hollywood-Metro and South Los Angeles. PARTICIPANTS: From 93 randomized programs, 4,440 clients were screened and of 1,322 depressed by the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) and providing contact information, 1,246 enrolled and 1,018 in 90 programs completed baseline or 6-month follow-up. MEASURES: Self-reported mental HRQL and probable depression (primary), physical activity, employment, homelessness risk factors (secondary) and services use. RESULTS: CEP was more effective than RS at improving mental HRQL, increasing physical activity and reducing homelessness risk factors, rate of behavioral health hospitalization and medication visits among specialty care users (i.e. psychiatrists, mental health providers) while increasing depression visits among users of primary care/public health for depression and users of faith-based and park programs (each p \ \textless \ 0.05). Employment, use of antidepressants, and total contacts were not significantly affected (each p \ \textgreater \ 0.05). CONCLUSION: Community engagement to build a collaborative approach to implementing depression QI across diverse programs was more effective than resources for services for individual programs in improving mental HRQL, physical activity and homelessness risk factors, and shifted utilization away from hospitalizations and specialty medication visits toward primary care and other sectors, offering an expanded health-home model to address multiple disparities for depressed safety-net clients.",2013.0,10.1007/s11606-013-2484-3,WIJPQF62,0,behavior,817

C.","Objective: To characterize neurobehavioral and substance abuse problems distinguishing between employed and unemployed persons with brain injury and to propose relevant vocational rehabilitation interventions. Design: A quasi-experimental, fixed effects factorial design was used. T-tests were used to compare employed and unemployed persons regarding neurobehavioral factor scale scores. Chi-square analyses were used to compare alcohol use and rate of mental health treatment for the two groups. Fisher's Exact Test was used to compare drug use for the two groups. Setting: Outpatient rehabilitation clinic at a large urban medical center. Participants: Patients with traumatic brain injury who received acute medical care and inpatient rehabilitation at a level I trauma center. Patients were evaluated an average of 16 months after injury. The employed (33 \ \% \ ) and unemployed (67 \ \% \ ) groups were similar regarding age and chronicity, but unemployed persons had more severe injuries. Main Outcome Measures: Neurobehavioral Functioning Inventory (NFI), Quantity Frequency Variability Index (QFVI), General Health and History Questionnaire. Results: Unemployed persons reported a greater frequency of difficulties on the NFl Depression, Attention/Memory, Aggression, Communication, and Motor scales. The most common difficulties among unemployed persons related to mood, personality, and slowness. Also, more unemployed persons had received mental health services. A substantially higher proportion of employed persons were classified as moderate or heavy drinkers, whereas there were more abstainers among the unemployed group. A low rate of drug use was reported and differences between groups were not observed. Conclusions: The unique neurobehavioral difficulties of unemployed persons should be carefully considered when developing empirically based preplacement training, job matching, and postplacement interventions. The high rate of alcohol use among employed persons indicates the need for follow-along that emphasizes education and prevention.",1997.0,,VJTUWLHL,0,personality,818
818,Inappropriate use of urinary catheters among hospitalized elderly patients,"Hu, F.; Tsai, C.; Chen, C.; Chang, C.","Hypothesis/aims of study Prolong urinary catheter use may lead to substantial complications and are often prescribe in hospitals without defined indications. Unfortunately, elderly patients were at greater risks of inappropriate use of urinary catheters. Studies of factors and clinical outcomes associated with inappropriate use of urinary catheters in the elderly population are rare. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the incidence, rationales, related factors and clinical outcomes for inappropriate use of urinary catheters among hospitalized elderly patients. Study design, materials and methods A longitudinal study enrolled patients aged 65 years and older with urinary catheter placed within 24 hours of hospitalization were conducted. Sample size was estimated by using G power 3.1.7. Based on previous study, the lowest parameter of relationship between inappropriate urinary catheter-days and CAUTIs was used for estimation (Odds ratio: 1.39). Other estimating parameters included the probability of Type-error 0.05 and power 0.8. It was estimated that as least 351 patients were required for this research. Criteria for urinary catheter use were developed to identify inappropriate catheter use. Characteristics of patients and catheter use, voiding function history, health conditions, care conditions of catheter placement, conditions of urinary catheter reinsertion, and subjective perception of urinary catheter use were collected through reviewing of medical records, interviewing patients or their primary caregivers. Mortality, length of hospital stay, time to first removal of catheter, catheter remaining in place at discharge, catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), catheter-related complications, change of activities of daily living (ADLs), and new admission to nursing home after discharge determined as clinical outcomes. Results A total of 327 patients were observed; 6 patients admitted to intensive care units were excluded from the study, leaving 321 patients for evaluation. The incidence of initial inappropriate placement of urinary catheters (IIPC) in hospitalized elderly patients was 38.3 \% . The main reason for IIPC was “convenience of care”. Factors associated with IIPC were chronic constipation, urinary tract infection history, medical treatment diagnosis, cognitive impairment, depressive symptoms, independence in ADLs, insertion of catheter during evening and night shifts, and lack of nursing documentation of the rationale for catheterization. Patients with IIPC showed greater decline in ADLs. Among 321 patients, a total of 1958 urinary catheter-days were observed, 1035 (52.8 \% ) urinary catheter-days were inappropriate. Inappropriate use of urinary catheters occurred mostly in females and surgical patients, and was associated with IIPC and lack of medical documentation. “Convenience of care” was the most common rationale for inappropriate use. Increasing inappropriate catheter-days was a significant predictor for longer hospital stay, delayed time to removal of catheters, increased rate of urinary catheterization at discharge, development of CAUTIs and catheter-related complications, and decline in ADLs. The incidence of catheter re-insertion was 20.6 \% , of which 49.5 \% of them were improperly re-inserted. The most common rationale for inappropriate urinary catheter re-insertion (IUCR) was “uncompleted documentation”. Patients with IUCR had more inappropriate urinary catheter-days before re-insertion. However, IUCR did not show significant association with clinical outcome. Interpretation of results Avoiding IIPC is vital. Elderly patients with many physical and psychological deficits may become the victims of IIPC. Vulnerable elders need more toileting assistance, which result in nurses may request a physician order for a urinary catheter to reduce workload. Nurses' awareness of indications for urinary catheters may prevent IIPC. Continuing education may be needed to enhance nurses' knowledge and appropriate attitude related to the urinary catheter pla",2016.0,,KCJD887R,0,cognitive,819

820,Patient perspectives on once-weekly fluoxetine.,"Judge, R.","BACKGROUND: Continuation therapy is recommended for 4 to 9 months following remission of symptoms of major depressive disorder. Long-term maintenance therapy is recommended for patients with severe, recurrent symptoms. However, most patients do not complete an adequate course of therapy. We investigated patient perceptions of antidepressant dosing to determine whether weekly dosing could provide an additional tool to help more patients remain compliant with antidepressant treatment. METHOD: Physicians were asked to complete an anonymous patient profile for 7 patients currently receiving antidepressant treatment and to give those patients a questionnaire that the patients could submit anonymously. In addition, clinically depressed patients in the United States and in France were surveyed by telephone. RESULTS: Patients surveyed by questionnaire agreed most strongly with statements indicating that they would like their doctor to involve them in the choice of antidepressant medication, that they did not want others to know they were taking antidepressant medication, and that they disliked the idea of taking daily medication. Patients in the telephone survey agreed most strongly with statements indicating that they considered once-weekly dosing more convenient than daily dosing, that they believed taking 1 pill a week would make them feel less dependent on pills, and that they perceived more advantages than disadvantages in taking 1 pill a week. CONCLUSION: Weekly antidepressant treatment may provide an effective tool in helping patients with depression. Positive patient perceptions of weekly dosing suggest that some patients may remain on continuation or maintenance therapy longer when they have the option of weekly dosing.",2001.0,,KT6DJ4ID,0,cognitive,821
821,Does the Use of Electroencephalographic Bispectral Index or Auditory Evoked Potential Index Monitoring Facilitate Recovery after Desflurane Anesthesia in the Ambulatory Setting?,"White, P. F.; Ma, H.; Tang, J.; Wender, R. H.; Sloninsky, A.; Kariger, R.","Background: Analogous to the Bispectral Index \ \textregistered \ (BIS \ \textregistered \ ) monitor, the auditory evoked potential monitor provides an electroencephalographic-derived index (AAI), which is alleged to correlate with the central nervous system depressant effects of anesthetic drugs. This clinical study was designed to test the hypothesis that intraoperative cerebral monitoring guided by either the BIS or the AAI value would facilitate recovery from general anesthesia compared with standard clinical monitoring practices alone in the ambulatory setting. Methods: Sixty consenting outpatients undergoing gynecologic laparoscopic surgery were randomly assigned to one of three study groups: (1) control (standard practice), (2) BIS guided, or (3) AAI guided. Anesthesia was induced with 1.5-2.5 mg/kg propofol and 1-1.5 \$ \mu \$ g/kg fentanyl given intravenously. Desflurane, 3 \ \% \ , in combination with 60 \ \% \ nitrous oxide in oxygen was administered for maintenance of general anesthesia. In the control group, the inspired desflurane concentration was varied based on standard clinical signs. In the BIS- and AAI-guided groups, the inspired desflurane concentrations were titrated to maintain BIS and AAI values in targeted ranges of 50-60 and 15-25, respectively. BIS and AAI values, hemodynamic variables, and the end-tidal desflurane concentration were recorded at 5-min intervals during the maintenance period. The emergence times and recovery times to achieve specific clinical endpoints were recorded at 1- to 10-min intervals. The White fast-track and modified Aldrete recovery scores were assessed on arrival in the PACU, and the quality of recovery score was evaluated at the time of discharge home. Results: A positive correlation was found between the AAI and BIS values during the maintenance period. The average BIS and AAI values (mean ± SD) during the maintenance period were significantly lower in the control group (BIS, 41 ± 10; AAI, 11 ± 6) compared with the BIS-guided (BIS, 57 ± 14; AAI, 18 ± 11) and AAI-guided (BIS, 55 ± 12; AAI, 20 ± 10) groups. The endtidal desflurane concentration was significantly reduced in the BIS-guided (2.7 ± 0.9 \ \% \ ) and AAI-guided (2.6 ± 0.9 \ \% \ ) groups compared with the control group (3.6 ± 1.5 \ \% \ ). The awakening (eye-opening) and discharge times were significantly shorter in the BIS-guided (7 ± 3 and 132 ± 39 min, respectively) and AAI-guided (6 ± 2 and 128 ± 39 min, respectively) groups compared with the control group (9 ± 4 and 195 ± 57 min, respectively). More importantly, the median [range] quality of recovery scores was significantly higher in the BIS-guided (18 [17-18]) and AAI-guided (18 [17-18]) groups when compared with the control group (16 [10-18]). Conclusion: Compared with standard anesthesia monitoring practice, adjunctive use of auditory evoked potential and BIS monitoring can improve titration of desflurane during general anesthesia, leading to an improved recovery profile after ambulatory surgery.",2004.0,,RAM9F35L,0,personality,822

Participants (N=60) were randomly assigned to either the group treatment or a wait-list control condition. Treatment significantly improved depressed mood, rumination, perceived control over rumination and dysfunctional metacognitive beliefs compared with the wait condition. Treatment gains were maintained over the follow-up period of 1 year. Attrition was low and treatment satisfaction was high. Eight individuals suffered from a depressive relapse/recurrence in the year following treatment.

823,Validity of imipramine platelet binding sites as a biological marker of endogenous depression: A world health organization collaborative study,"Mellerup, E.; Langer, S. Z.","Any dysfunction in the serotonergic system is considered to be of potential importance with respect to the biology of affective disorders. The imipramine binding site which is located on the serotonin transporter in membranes from platelets and serotonergic neurones (Raisman et al., 1979; Briley et al., 1979; Langer et al., 1980; Fuxe et al., 1983) may be a genetically (Friedl and Propping, 1984) determined factor related to the transport of serotonin, and thus a possible biological marker for susceptibility to depressive illness. This possibility was emphasized when it was reported that platelets isolated from depressed patients contained smaller amounts of imipramine binding sites than platelets from control persons (Briley et al., 1980). The first clinical investigation was followed by numerous others and so far about forty studies have analysed platelet imipramine binding in depressed patients and healthy controls. For review see Langer and Schoemaker (1988) and Mellerup and Plenge (1988). Around two thirds of the reports showed decreased platelet imipramine binding in depressed patients, whereas one third found no differences between depressed patients and controls. Some years ago it was decided that the WHO collaborating centres for research and training in biological psychiatry should organize a multicentre study of platelet imipramine binding. The aim of the study was partly to repeat previous studies, though with a larger number of depressed patients and controls, and partly to investigate whether the conflicting results in the literature might reflect transcultural differences in density of imipramine binding sites. The centres in Athens, Basle, Brussels, Copenhagen, Irvine, Milan/Naples, Moscow, Munich and Tokyo participated in the study. All the centres agreed to follow a common protocol which was prepared by the centres in Moscow, Paris and Copenhagen (Morozov, 1985). The centres in Basle, Brussels and Irvine analysed the imipramine binding in their own samples. In all the other centres the isolated platelets were sent to Copenhagen for the imipramine binding analysis. Some duplicate samples from Basle and Brussels were sent to Copenhagen in order to test the reliability between the procedures in the three centres.",1990.0,,NMB7PHAS,0,cognitive_additional,824
824,Gender and coping: Use of distinct strategies and associations with stress and depression.,"Felsten, Gary","Evaluated gender differences in the use of 3 distinct coping strategies, and in associations between those strategies, stress, and symptoms of depression in 233 college students. Women used slightly more social support seeking than men, but men and women did not differ in the use of problem-solving or avoidance. There were no gender differences in associations between stress, coping, and depression for problem-solving or social support seeking. Problem-solving was a weak predictor of depression, and surprisingly, the stress-depression relationship was slightly stronger in participants who used more problem-solving. Social support seeking moderated the stress-depression relationship equally in men and women. Avoidance coping was a powerful predictor of depression in men and women; however, it exacerbated the negative effect of stress only in men.

826,The efficacy of a combined cognitive-behavioural and interpersonal therapy approach to the treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome: A randomized controlled trial.,"Langford, Melanie Marie","The purpose of the current study was to develop a manualized treatment for fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) and to examine the efficacy of the treatment in a randomized controlled clinical trial. FM is a chronic musculoskeletal pain disorder characterized by tender points and generalized pain. Depression, chronic fatigue, and sleep disturbance are common. A biopsychosocial model served as a framework for understanding FM by integrating psychological, social, and physical factors. Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), an empirically validated treatment for arthritis, has also been used with FM patients in an attempt to improve pain control, reduce disability, and increase self-efficacy. Overall, the attention/placebo controlled studies employing CBT as a treatment for FM show that it is not superior to a credible attention placebo. The current study attempted to combine the necessary components of CBT with interpersonal therapy to address relational patterns and personality characteristics that can affect ability to cope with chronic pain. One hundred and five women diagnosed with FM by a rheumatologist were randomly assigned to the CBT-interpersonal treatment condition or an attention-control condition. There were 8 treatment groups with a mean of6-7 participants in each. The treatment consisted of weekly 2-hour sessions over 8 consecutive weeks. Outcome measures included: FM impact, pain, health care utilization, depression, coping, and self-efficacy. An intention-to-treat analysis was conducted. Results showed that the impact of FM symptoms was reduced following treatment compared to the control group and this was statistically and clinically significant, but was not maintained at 3-month follow-up. Significant improvements were also observed in coping strategies, some of which were maintained at follow-up. Importantly, self-efficacy improved significantly following treatment compared to the control group. Self-efficacy beliefs have been related to pain, coping efforts, disability, and psychological functioning. Directions for future research may include a focus on long-term maintenance of treatment gains that may be mediated by improvements in self-efficacy. There is strong evidence that changes in self-efficacy are enduring and affect changes in health behaviours and health status.

Three hundred and fifty six kindergarten children (182 boys) and their mothers participated in the study. During kindergarten, mothers reported their level of depressive symptomatology. In first grade, teachers rated children's emotion regulation at school and observers rated the affective quality of mother-child interactions. During second grade, children's social preference was assessed by peer nomination. Results indicated that mothers' level of depressive symptomatology negatively predicted their child's social preference 2 years later, controlling for the family SES and teacher-rated social preference during kindergarten. Among European American families, the association between maternal depressive symptoms and social preference was partially mediated by maternal warmth and the child's emotion regulation. Although the relation between maternal depressive symptoms and children peer preference was stronger among African American families than Europrean American families, its mediation by the maternal warmth and child's emotion regulation was not found in African American families.",2011.0,10.1007/s10802-010-9468-0,B4J5286S,0,cognitive_additional,828
828,"Adolescent parental loss, meaning, and self: An existential and psychodynamic exploration.","Skillestad, Katherine","This research study examined how parental loss through death and divorce and attributional style relate to an adolescent's developing self. Self was thought of as a multidimensional system and was measured via the Piers-Harris Self-Concept Scale, Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Early Memories Test, and the Child and Adolescent Adjustment Profile. Attributional style was measured via the Children's Attributional Style Questionnaire. These instruments provided a system to measure the functions of a healthy and integrated self. One hundred and three Caucasian adolescents between the ages of 13 and 15-years-old participated in the study. Specifically, 60 females and 43 males were statistically studied. Gender differences were not found between females and males on dependent variables. This study was a retrospective design with static subjects. Two-way ANOVAs along with independent t-tests were primary means of evaluating the hypotheses. The results of this study suggested that adolescents who come from intact families had a healthy sense of self despite a negative attributional style. Further, adolescents who had lost a parent from death and divorce, and had a negative attributional style experienced deficits in self-concept, self-esteem, and were depressed as compared to bereaved adolescents who had a positive attributional style. The results of this study were discussed in the context of self psychology theory and existential philosophy.

Insomniacs were significantly more depressed than normals on Zung's Self-Rating Depression Scale and the MMPI D scale. Insomniacs showed more anxious worrying behavior (high on the MMPI Pt, Hy, Hs, Taylor Manifest Anxiety scale, and Eysenck's Neuroticism scale, toward the sensitization end on Byrne's Repression-Sensitization scale, and overly concerned about the past and future on the Time Competence scale). Insomniacs also appeared to be sensory reducers, as evidenced by lower evoked potential responses to sound and by low scores on Zuckerman's Sensation-Seeking Scale. They were also less proficient in perceptual-motor skills on the WAIS. A stepwise regression analysis showed that the sensation-avoiding dimension accounted for the most variance in predicting an EEG sleep-efficiency criterion.

830,"Cognitive biases predict symptoms of depression, anxiety and wellbeing above and beyond neuroticism in adolescence","Smith, E. M.; Reynolds, S.; Orchard, F.; Whalley, H. C.; Chan, S. W.","BACKGROUND: Adolescence represents a period of vulnerability to affective disorders. Neuroticism is considered a heritable risk factor for depression, but is not directly amenable to intervention. Therefore, it is important to identify the contributions of modifiable risk factors. Negative cognitive biases are implicated in the onset and maintenance of affective disorders in adults, and may represent modifiable risk factors in adolescence. AIM(S): This study sought to assess to what extent cognitive biases are able to predict depression, anxiety and wellbeing beyond that of neuroticism in adolescents. METHODS: Adolescents (N=99), recruited from Scottish secondary schools (54.5% female; mean age=14.7), ensured a sample representing the breadth of the mental health spectrum. In line with prevalence estimates, 18% of this sample demonstrated clinical levels of depression symptoms. Cognitive biases of autobiographical memory, self-referential memory, ambiguous scenarios interpretation, facial expression recognition, rumination and dysfunctional attitudes were assessed. Depression, anxiety, and wellbeing were indexed using the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, Spence Children's Anxiety Scale and the BBC Subjective Wellbeing Scale. RESULTS: Regression analyses demonstrated neuroticism to significantly predict depression, anxiety and wellbeing. The addition of cognitive biases resulted in a significant increase of explained variance with final models explaining just over 50% of variances of depression, anxiety and wellbeing. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that cognitive biases explain mental health symptoms over and above that of neuroticism. Depressive symptomology was particularly related to self-referential memory bias, while anxiety was predicted by interpretive bias. The key clinical implication is that targeting specific biases based on diagnostic features may be of particular benefit in alleviating distress and promoting wellbeing.",2018.0,10.1016/j.jad.2018.08.051,5NVIQGUD,0,additional,831

In major depressives, the presence of psychomotor retardation and melancholia during the index episode was associated with a favorable response to treatment, whereas the presence of mood-incongruent psychotic features during the same episode, a high score on the anxiety and phobic subscales of the Middlesex Hospital Questionnaire and a high score on the neuroticism subscale of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire were related to a poor response. These findings are discussed in the light of the heterogeneity of DSM III major depression and of the reported common occurrence of an anxiety-phobic personality profile in unipolar depressives. In bipolar patients, a family history of bipolar affective illness and a high lithium ratio were associated with a good response to treatment, and the presence of the HLA-A3 antigen with an unfavorable response. These findings seem to support a role of pharmacogenetic factors in conditioning response to lithium prophylaxis.",1985.0,10.1055/s-2007-1017387,EXP49WVT,0,behavior,832

The mentation in this period is filled with a lot of special psychological contradictions and conflicts. Long-term psychological worry will affect the formation of perfect personality. Objective: To understand the psychological health status in the middle-school students of Zhuang nationality and the main factors of influence. Design: Randomized cluster sampling and questionnaire investigation based on middle-school students. Setting: Department of Preventive Medicine, Youjiang Medical College of Nationalities. Participants: 2 000 middle-school students of 34 classes from 3 middle schools in Baise City and Longlin County were selected to attend the investigation with randomized cluster sampling method in November 2003. Methods: The psychological health statuses of middle-school students we re evaluated with symptom checklist (SCL). The list contained 90 items, including 9 factors of psychological symptom such as somatization, compulsion, sensitivity to human relations, anxiety, depression, hostility, dread, paranoia and psychosis. The grading system from 1 to 5 grades was used and the standard of the adult norm of the whole country was refered to: Factor score \ \textless \ 1.8 was normal; Factor score from 1.8 to 2.0 was mild abnormality; Factor score from 2.1 to 3.0 was moderate abnormality; Factor score \ \textgreater \ 3.0 was severe abnormality.

METHOD: Blind family history interviews were conducted with family informants to assess the extent to which first-degree relatives of 29 probands with borderline personality disorder, 22 probands with other personality disorders who met three or fewer of the criteria for borderline personality disorder, and 43 probands with schizophrenia fulfilled operationalized criteria for the two kinds of personality disorder traits and for other diagnostic categories. The crude proportions of adult relatives with each diagnosis, as well as the age-adjusted morbid risks, were assessed in the three groups of relatives. RESULTS: The risks for affective and impulsive personality disorder traits were independently greater in the 129 relatives of the borderline probands than in the 105 relatives of the probands with other personality disorders and the 218 relatives of the schizophrenic probands. There was no similarly greater risk for any other psychiatric disorder assessed, including major affective disorder. In addition, the relatives of borderline probands with current or past major depressive disorder showed a greater risk for major affective disorders than the relatives of never-depressed probands with other personality disorders but not the relatives of never-depressed borderline probands.

Depression now becomes a very individual and uniquely human matter. Broadly speaking, the subjective experience of depression can be broken down into aspects of sadness, anger, guilt, despair, and diminished self-esteem. Psychotherapy becomes highly relevant, fundamental to effective patient care and treatment. It pays a crucial role in the treatment of depression. Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) focuses particularly on the patient's relationships and roles in regard to others. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) seeks out underlying automatic thoughts and schemata that stimulate the painful affective state of depression, while teaching active behavioral techniques to manage anxiety and dysphoria. Psychodynamic psychotherapy focuses more broadly on the person as a whole and has a long-established experience base.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of a Czech version of the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) scale assessing the levels of self-stigma in individuals with mental disorders. METHODS: It consists of 29 items classified into 5 subscales, namely alienation, stereotype endorsement, perceived discrimination, social withdrawal and stigma resistance.

However, ADT comes with a host of its own serious side effects. There is considerable evidence of the adverse cardiovascular, metabolic, and musculoskeletal effects of ADT. Far less has been written about the psychological effects of ADT. This review highlights several adverse psychological effects of ADT. The authors provide evidence for the effect of ADT on men's sexual function, their partner, and their sexual relationship. Evidence of increased emotional lability and depressed mood in men who receive ADT is also presented, and the risk of depression in the patient's partner is discussed. The evidence for adverse cognitive effects with ADT is still emerging but suggests that ADT is associated with impairment in multiple cognitive domains. Finally, the available literature is reviewed on interventions to mitigate the psychological effects of ADT. Across the array of adverse effects, physical exercise appears to have the greatest potential to address the psychological effects of ADT both in men who are receiving ADT and in their partners.

A master regulator in central and peripheral stress responses.,"Mustafa, T.","The neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a master regulator of central and peripheral stress responses required to restore and maintain homeostasis. PACAP modulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in response to acute psychogenic but not systemic stressors, through activation of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) release to drive adrenal corticosterone (CORT) output. During direct high-frequency stimulation of the splanchnic nerve that is designed to mimic stress, PACAP regulates adrenomedullary catecholamine secretion. In addition to transmission, PACAP simultaneously facilitates the biosynthesis of adrenomedullary catecholamines through stimulus-secretion-synthesis coupling. During periods of chronic psychogenic stress, PACAP-mediated CORT elevation fails to desensitize and contributes to the development of maladaptive behaviors such as anxiety and depression. Based on these findings, PACAP regulates not only adaptive responses to stress but also maladaptive responses to sustained psychological stress. PACAP receptor antagonists could have therapeutic relevance in preventing hyperactivity of the HPA axis and offering protection against chronic stress-associated anxiety and depression. \textcopyright 2013 Elsevier Inc.",2013.0,10.1016/B978-0-12-411512-5.00021-X,ZKQQJLAH,0,diathesis,840
840,The psychoanalytic contribution.,"Sehl, Mark","This chapter explores the contribution that the psychoanalytic tradition has made to harm reduction psychotherapy, particularly in its emphasis on the importance of the multiple meanings of drug use and the centrality of the therapeutic relationship in effective psychotherapy. An accompanying story presents the case of a depressed, socially isolated elderly woman with severe alcohol dependency who was helped by a harm reduction approach to achieve abstinence from alcohol in the course of addressing her emotional difficulties. The story shows how a harm reduction approach is consistent with a psychoanalytic understanding of the S's drinking. It also challenges prevailing misconceptions about psychoanalytic treatment in describing an analytic psychotherapy that was very different from the classical approach yet remained true to analytic principles.

843,"Socio-demographic, health-related and psychosocial correlates of fear of falling and avoidance of activity in community-living older persons who avoid activity due to fear of falling","Kempen, G. I. and","Background. Fear of falling and avoidance of activity are common in old age and are suggested to be (public) health problems of equal importance to falls. Earlier studies of correlates of fear of falling and avoidance of activity did hardly differentiate between severe and mild levels of fear of falling and avoidance of activity which may be relevant from clinical point of view. Furthermore, most studies focused only on socio-demographics and/or health-related variables and hardly incorporated an extensive range of potential correlates of fear of falling including psychosocial variables. This study analyzes the univariate and multivariate associations between five socio-demographic, seven health-related and six psychosocial variables and levels of fear of falling and avoidance of activity in older persons who avoid activity due to fear of falling. Methods. Cross-sectional study in 540 community-living older people aged 70 years with at least mild fear of falling and avoidance of activity. Chi-squares, t-tests and logistics regression analyses were performed to study the associations between the selected correlates and both outcomes. Results. Old age, female sex, limitations in activity of daily living, impaired vision, poor perceived health, chronic morbidity, falls, low general self-efficacy, low mastery, loneliness, feelings of anxiety and symptoms of depression were identified as univariate correlates of severe fear of falling and avoidance of activity. Female sex, limitations in activity of daily living and one or more falls in the previous six months correlated independently with severe fear of falling. Higher age and limitations in activity of daily living correlated independently with severe avoidance of activity. Conclusion. Psychosocial variables did not contribute independently to the difference between mild and severe fear of falling and to the difference between mild and severe avoidance of activity due to fear of falling. Although knowledge about the unique associations of specific variables with levels of severe fear of falling and avoidance of activity is of interest for theoretical reasons, knowledge of univariate association may also help to specify the concepts for developing interventions and programmes to reduce fear of falling and avoidance of activity in old age, particularly in their early stages of development. \textcopyright 2009 Kempen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2009.0,,C7INZVE6,0,behavior,844
844,Risky feelings: why a 6 \% risk of cancer does not always feel like 6 \% .,"Zikmund-Fisher, Brian J.; Fagerlin, Angela; Ubel, Peter A.","OBJECTIVE: Emotion plays a strong role in the perception of risk information but is frequently underemphasized in the decision-making and communication literature. We sought to discuss and put into context several lines of research that have explored the links between emotion and risk perceptions. METHODS: In this article, we provide a focused, state of the science review of research revealing the ways that emotion, or affect, influences people's cancer-related decisions. We identify illustrative experimental research studies that demonstrate the role of affect in people's estimates of cancer risk, their decisions between different cancer treatments, their perceptions of the chance of cancer recurrence, and their reactions to different methods of presenting risk information. RESULTS: These studies show that people have strong affective reactions to cancer risk information and that the way risk information is presented often determines the emotional gist people take away from such communications. CONCLUSION: Cancer researchers, educators and oncologists need to be aware that emotions are often more influential in decision making about cancer treatments and prevention behaviors than factual knowledge is.

846,"Design paper: The DEMO trial: A randomized, parallel-group, observer-blinded clinical trial of aerobic versus non-aerobic versus relaxation training for patients with light to moderate depression","Krogh, Jesper; Petersen, Lone; Timmermann, Michael; Saltin, Bengt; Nordentoft, Merete","Background: In western countries, the yearly incidence of depression is estimated to be 3-5 \% and the lifetime prevalence is 17 \% . In patient populations with chronic diseases the point prevalence may be 20 \% . Depression is associated with increased risk for various conditions such as osteoporoses, cardiovascular diseases, and dementia. WHO stated in 2000 that depression was the fourth leading cause of disease burden in terms of disability. In 2000 the cost of depression in the US was estimated to 83 billion dollars. A predominance of trials suggests that physical exercise has a positive effect on depressive symptoms. However, a meta-analysis from 2001 stated: The effectiveness of exercise in reducing symptoms of depression cannot be determined because of a lack of good quality research on clinical populations with adequate follow-up. . Objectives: The major objective for this randomized trial is to compare the effect of non-aerobic, aerobic, and relaxation training on depressive symptoms using the blindly assessed Hamilton depression scale (HAM-D17) as primary outcome. The secondary outcome is the effect of the intervention on working status (i.e., lost days from work, employed/unemployed) and the tertiary outcomes consist of biological responses. Design: The trial is designed as a randomized, parallel-group, observer-blinded clinical trial. Patients are recruited through general practitioners and psychiatrist and randomized to three different interventions: 1) non-aerobic, - progressive resistance training, 2) aerobic training, - cardio respiratory fitness, and 3) relaxation training with minimal impact on strength or cardio respiratory fitness. Training for all three groups takes place twice a week for 4 months. Evaluation of patients' symptoms takes place four and 12 months after inclusion. The trial is designed to include 45 patients in each group. Statistical analysis will be done as intention to treat (all randomized patients). Results from the DEMO trial will be reported according to the CONSORT guidelines in 2008-2009. \textcopyright 2006 Elsevier Inc.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The evaluation took place from January 2011 to December 2013 in the Psycho-social Assistance Office of the Sfanta Parascheva Infectious Diseases Hospital in Iasi. We evaluated 146 patients newly diagnosed with HIV infection, both in terms of immunological and virusological and from a psychological perspective, using the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI) and the clinical interview. RESULTS: In a period of 3 years (January 2011 - December 2013) we registered in the HIV/AIDS Regional Center in Iasi, 146 new cases of HIV infection in adults, with distribution by years as follows: 46 in 2011, 45 in 2012, 55 in 2013; 39 cases were in Iasi, 39 in Suceava, 26 in Botosani, 18 in Neamt 18, 16 in Bacau and 6 in Vaslui. Of these, 51 were women and 95 men, aged between 24 and 46 years. From the immunological point of view, 11 \% of patients had values of CD4 \textgreater 500 (16 patients), 47 \% between 500 and 100 (69 patients) and 42 \% \textless 100 (61 patients). From a psychological perspective, the clinical interview revealed a state of fear in 68.5 \% of cases (fear of death, fear of complications, fear of other people's reaction to the diagnosis), confusion in 62 \% of cases (in terms of diagnosis, the mode of infection, the future), anger in 27 \% of cases (against the source of infection, against themselves, against God or divinity), guilt and self-blame in 7 \% of cases. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) revealed moderate depression in 14 \% of patients; mild depression in 27 \% of patients and 58 \% of patients presented no symptoms of depression. Regarding the anxiety scale HAMA, in 54 \% of cases it showed mild anxiety, average anxiety in 28 \% of cases, 14 \% severe anxiety and 3 \% (4 cases) very severe anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Patients newly diagnosed with HIV are a vulnerable population with a specific psycho-emotional profile.

C.; Eutrope, J.; Thierry, A.; Bednarek, N.; Aupetit, L.; Saad, S.; Vulliez, L.; Sibertin-Blanc, D.; Nezelof, S.; Rolland, A. C.","Objectives: Very preterm infants are known to be at risk of developmental disabilities and behavioural disorders. This condition is supposed to alter mother-infant interactions. Here we hypothesize that the parental coping with the very preterm birth may greatly influence mother-infant interactions. Methods: 100 dyads were included in 3 university hospitals in France. Preterm babies at higher risk of neurodevelopmental sequelae (PRI \textgreater 10) were excluded to target the maternal determinants of mother-infant interaction. We report the follow-up of this cohort during 1 year after very preterm birth, with regular assessment of infant somatic state, mother psychological state and the assessment of mother-infant interaction at 12 months by validated scales (mPPQ, HADS, EPDS, PRI, DDST and PIPE). Results: We show that the intensity of post-traumatic reaction of the mother 6 months after birth is negatively correlated with the quality of mother-infant interaction at 12 months. Moreover, the anxious and depressive symptoms of the mother 6 and 12 months after birth are also correlated with the quality of mother-infant interaction at 12 months. By contrast, this interaction is not influenced by the initial affective state of the mother in the 2 weeks following birth. In this particular population of infants at low risk of sequelae, we also show that the quality of mother-infant interaction is not correlated with the assessment of the infant in the neonatal period but is correlated with the fine motor skills of the baby 12 months after birth. Conclusions: This study suggests that mothers' psychological condition has to be monitored during the first year of very preterm infants' follow-up. It also suggests that parental interventions have to be proposed when a post-traumatic, anxious or depressive reaction is suspected.",2016.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0151091,I2PEXESD,0,diathesis,850

BPs do not believe that the analyst intends to listen to them, and words are used as weapons to attack the analyst or to avoid self-revelation. Clinical evidence suggests a disturbance in the wish to communicate at the oral and anal stages of development.

METHODS: CFF-CBT group treatment was provided to twenty six families who had children with a diagnosis of PBD ranging between six- and twelve-years-old. RESULTS: Results indicated that CFF-CBT was feasible and acceptable to families. CFF-CBT resulted in significant improvement in manic, but not depressive, symptoms and in children's psychosocial functioning post-treatment. In addition, although not statistically significant, parents reported an increased ability to cope with their child's illness. Results of this study suggest that group psychosocial treatment provided alongside pharmacotherapy may help attain remission of symptoms, as well as increase overall psychosocial coping and well-being in both children and parents.

Further, stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system by elevating plasma cortisol levels. However, little is known about the related downstream molecular pathway. In this study, by using repeated water-immersion and restraint stress (WIRS) as a stressor for mice, we attempted to elucidate the molecular pathway induced by elevated plasma corticosterone levels. We observed the following effects both, in vivo and in vitro: (1) repeated exposure to WIRS activates the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase (PDK1)-serum glucocorticoid regulated kinase (SGK1)-N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1)-adhesion molecule (i.e., N-cadherin, $\alpha$-catenin, and $\beta$-catenin) stabilization pathway via an increase in plasma corticosterone levels; (2) the activation of this signaling pathway induces morphological changes in oligodendrocytes; and (3) after recovery from chronic stress, the abnormal arborization of oligodendrocytes and depression-like symptoms return to the control levels. Our data strongly suggest that these abnornalities of oligodendrocytes are possibly related to depression-like symptoms. \textcopyright 2011 Miyata et al.",2011.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0019859,G64JLNZ9,0,diathesis,854

DESIGN: Pretest and post-test quasiexperimental. SETTING: Outpatient oncology rehabilitation center. SAMPLE: 96 breast cancer survivors undergoing various clinical treatments. METHODS: Subjects were divided into four groups based on the specific type of clinical treatment: surgery alone (n = 22); surgery and chemotherapy (n = 30); surgery and radiation (n = 17); and surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation (n = 27). Following a comprehensive screening and medical examination, cardiovascular endurance, pulmonary function, and fatigue were assessed, leading to the development of an individualized exercise prescription and a six-month exercise intervention. Repeated-measures analysis of variance and covariance were used to compare the effectiveness of the intervention and differences among treatment groups. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, resting heart rate, forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume, predicted oxygen consumption, time on treadmill, and fatigue. FINDINGS: Cardiopulmonary function (predicted maximal oxygen consumption and time on treadmill) significantly increased in all groups after exercise training. In addition, resting heart rate and forced vital capacity significantly improved in those receiving surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Psychologically, the exercise intervention resulted in significant reductions in behavioral, affective, sensory, cognitive and mood, and total fatigue scale scores in all three groups who received treatment with surgery. The breast cancer survivors in the surgery-alone group showed significant reductions in behavioral, affective, and total fatigue scale scores but not in sensory and cognitive and mood fatigue scale scores. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that moderate intensity, individualized, prescriptive exercise maintains or improves cardiopulmonary function with concomitant reductions in fatigue regardless of treatment type. Moreover, cancer survivors receiving combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy following surgery appear to benefit to a greater extent as a result of an individualized exercise intervention. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Clinicians need to be aware of adjuvant therapies such as moderate exercise that attenuate negative side effects of cancer treatments. Symptom management recommendations should be given to cancer survivors concerning the effectiveness of exercise throughout the cancer continuum and the importance of participating in a cancer rehabilitation exercise program.",2008.0,10.1188/08.ONF.909-915,KZ5MEIZ2,0,cognitive,855

No biological or clinical marker has demonstrated sufficient ability to match individuals to efficacious treatment. Biosignatures developed from the systematic exploration of multiple biological markers, which optimize treatment selection for individuals (moderators) and provide early indication of ultimate treatment response (mediators) are needed. The rationale and design of a multi-site, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of sertraline examining moderators and mediators of treatment response is described. The target sample is 300 participants with early onset (</=30 years) recurrent MDD. Non-responders to an 8-week trial are switched double blind to either bupropion (for sertraline non-responders) or sertraline (for placebo non-responders) for an additional 8 weeks. Clinical moderators include anxious depression, early trauma, gender, melancholic and atypical depression, anger attacks, Axis II disorder, hypersomnia/fatigue, and chronicity of depression. Biological moderator and mediators include cerebral cortical thickness, task-based fMRI (reward and emotion conflict), resting connectivity, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), arterial spin labeling (ASL), electroencephalograpy (EEG), cortical evoked potentials, and behavioral/cognitive tasks evaluated at baseline and week 1, except DTI, assessed only at baseline.

A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to determine whether antidepressants are more effective than placebo in the treatment of depression in neurological disorders, and whether any benefit is associated with improvement in function. METHODS: Embase, Pubmed, Psycinfo and Cochrane trial registers were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of antidepressant and placebo in the treatment of depression in adults with a neurological disorder. FINDINGS: 20 RCTs were included in the review, including patients with Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, brain injury, epilepsy and stroke. Outcomes were analysed at four time points: 4-5 weeks, 6-8 weeks, 9-18 weeks and \textgreater 18 weeks. The primary outcome was response to treatment at 6-8 weeks. The evidence favoured the use of antidepressants over placebo at all time points although pooled results were not statistically significant at all time points. At 6-8 weeks, antidepressant treatment was associated with a greater than twofold odds of remission (OR 2.23; 95 \% CI 1.54 to 3.23; number needed to treat=7). Fewer data were available for quality of life, and functional and cognitive outcomes, and there was little evidence of improvement with antidepressant treatment. INTERPRETATION: Antidepressants are effective for the treatment of depression in patients with neurological disorders but the evidence for the efficacy of antidepressants in improving quality of life, and functional and cognitive outcomes is inconclusive.",2011.0,10.1136/jnnp.2010.230862,EW8KY8GQ,0,cognitive,859
859,Container-contained: Psychoanalytically informed work in a social services unit for disturbed adolescent boys,"James, A.","It is argued that psychoanalytic concepts are particularly relevant to the residential care of severely disturbed adolescents. When working with adolescents who have fragmented, partially projected object relations, Bion's ideas on emotional containment are an essential framework. Within an institution, the gathering up and working with split transferences can be seen as a first step in the process of correcting what Rousillon (1998) termed the defective process of symbolisation. In most cases of severe delinquency there is an initial emotional disturbance where the fundamental disturbance or fault lies in the relationships formed within the paranoid-schizoid and depressive positions. As a result of a faulty container-contained stage of development, there is an enduring tendency to delinquent acting out, reflecting a lack of containment. From a psychoanalytic perspective, the inability to tolerate frustration, the propensity to action and the disturbance of thinking, are important areas for therapeutic work. It is argued that psychoanalytically informed work can help make sense of what is often seen as wanton destructiveness, and help maintain a therapeutic focus using the relationships formed with staff as a primary agent of therapeutic change.",2002.0,,CVMKRPJV,0,psychodynamic,860

Of 195 depressed outpatients in a randomized treatment trial of fluoxetine or nortriptyline, 16 met DSA-IV criteria for atypical depression. We compared the personality traits and disorders in those with and without atypical depression. In atypical depression, fluoxetine was superior to nortriptyline. On the Temperament and Character Inventory, those with atypical depression had high attachment, low persistence, and high anticipatory anxiety. A temperament construct of these dimensions was associated with a differential antidepressant response, regardless of other atypical features. A temperament derived measure of 'rejection sensitivity' defines a group of depressed patients with a differential antidepressant response, regardless of reversed vegetative symptoms.",2004.0,,Q6J3Q57Q,0,personality,861
861,Continuation/maintenance treatment with nortriptyline versus combined nortriptyline and ECT in late-life psychotic depression: a two-year randomized study,"Navarro, V.; Gast","OBJECTIVE: The identification of effective continuation and maintenance strategies for elderly patients with psychotic depression is a critical issue that has not been fully explored. The aim of this study was to assess the tolerability and efficacy of continuation/maintenance electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in elderly patients with psychotic depression after acute ECT remission. METHODS: The authors used a longitudinal, randomized, single-blind design to compare by survival analysis the 2-year outcome of two subgroups of elderly patients with psychotic unipolar depression who were ECT (plus nortriptyline) remitters. One group was treated with a continuation/maintenance nortriptyline regimen (N = 17) and the other with combined continuation/maintenance ECT plus nortriptyline (N = 16). RESULTS: Over 2 years of treatment in elderly, psychotic, unipolar depressed ECT (plus nortriptyline) remitters, the mean survival time was significantly longer in the combined ECT plus nortriptyline subgroup than in the nortriptyline subgroup. No differences were observed between treatments with regard to tolerability. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the judicious use of combined continuation/maintenance ECT and antidepressant treatment in elderly patients with psychotic unipolar depression who are ECT remitters.",2008.0,10.1097/JGP.0b013e318170a6fa,EGXC95RB,0,personality,862
862,"Adolescent acceptance of pain: Confirmatory factor analysis and further validation of the chronic pain acceptance questionnaire, adolescent version.","Wallace, Dustin P.; Harbeck-Weber, Cynthia; Whiteside, Stephen P. H.; Harrison, Tracy E.","Preliminary reports suggest that acceptance of pain is an important construct when assessing and treating adolescents with chronic pain. Although the Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire, Adolescent version (CPAQ-A) appears to be a promising tool, it has been evaluated in only 1 study. The current results present a confirmatory analysis of the CPAQ-A and validity data collected independently from the developers of the scale. A sample of 109 adolescents with chronic pain completed the CPAQ-A, as well as measures of pain characteristics, functional impairment, depression, anxiety, and pain self-efficacy. Results of the confirmatory factor analysis indicate the previously reported 2-factor solution provides a good fit to the data, and has acceptable internal consistency. The CPAQ-A correlated strongly with disability, depression, anxiety, and self-efficacy. It correlated only moderately with pain intensity and was not correlated with pain frequency or duration of pain. When entered last into a hierarchical regression model predicting disability, acceptance accounted for more variance than pain intensity, depression, anxiety, and self-efficacy. Results supported the internal consistency and validity of the CPAQ-A as a measure of pain acceptance in this sample of adolescents with chronic pain. Use of the CPAQ-A may provide valuable insight into the manner in which adolescents adapt to chronic pain and can guide acceptance-based treatment. Perspective: This article strengthens the psychometric support for a measure of chronic pain acceptance in adolescents. Acceptance-based treatment has been shown to reduce disability in preliminary research targeting adolescents with chronic pain; the CPAQ-A may be useful for assessing the degree to which acceptance-based approaches may be indicated for a given patient.

864,Appearance concerns and psychosocial adjustment following head and neck cancer: A cross-sectional study and nine-month follow-up.,"Clarke, Sally-Ann; Newell, Robert; Thompson, Andrew; Harcourt, Diana; Lindenmeyer, Antje","Psychosocial difficulties have been reported in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients, yet only few studies have assessed the impact of altered appearance following HNC treatment using theoretically selected measures of appearance-related distress. This study investigated appearance-related adjustment following HNC, and demographic and socio-cognitive predictors of adjustment. HNC patients (n=49) completed baseline questionnaires and a nine-month postal follow-up (n=20). Participants showed considerable variation in appearance-related adjustment, with females reporting higher levels of appearance-related distress (derriford appearance scale [DAS-24]) than females in the general population and male HNC survivors. Depression scores on the hospital anxiety and depression scale were higher than UK norms whilst anxiety was similar to UK norms. There were no significant differences between baseline and follow-up data. Fear of negative evaluation (a central feature of social anxiety) was a significant predictor of appearance-related adjustment at baseline, whilst dispositional optimism was a significant predictor of appearance-related adjustment at baseline and follow-up. Qualitative responses showed themes of appearance and disability, and coping strategies. Findings suggest that appearance-related adjustment post-HNC varies considerably and psychosocial services working with HNC patients should consider this broad pattern of response. Future research to examine the role of socio-cognitive predictors of appearance-related adjustment could progress development of effective psychological interventions.",2014.0,10.1080/13548506.2013.855319,BVHPNVUC,0,cognitive,865

K.; Wolynczyk-Gmaj, D.; Sedek, G.","Cognitive deficits in depression are mostly apparent in executive functions, especially when integration of information and reasoning is required. In parallel, there are also numerous studies pointing to the frontal alpha band asymmetry as a psychophysiological marker of depression. In this study, we explored the role of frontal alpha asymmetry as a potential factor explaining the cognitive problems accompanying depression. Twenty-six depressed and 26 control participants completed a reasoning task and underwent 5 minutes of electroencephalography recording. In line with the previous studies, depressed people showed difficulties with reasoning but we did not observe the relationship between frontal asymmetry in the alpha band and depression. However, we found that in the depressed group the frontal alpha asymmetry index was characterised by larger variance than in the control group, and it was also a strong predictor of cognitive functioning exclusively in the depressed group. Our results point to the disruption of a psychophysiological balance, reflected in changed frontal alpha asymmetry (into more left-sided frontal asymmetry in the alpha band, reflecting more right-sided cortical activity) as a possible brain correlate of cognitive disturbances present in depressive disorders.",2017.0,10.1080/02699931.2016.1170669,R3KBJ6C8,0,additional,866
866,Clinical treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder.,"Pittenger, Christopher; Kelmendi, Ben; Bloch, Michael; Krystal, John H.; Coric, Vladimir","Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) was once thought to be extremely rare, but recent epidemiological studies have shown it to be the fourth most common psychiatric disorder (after substance abuse, specific phobias, and major depression). OCD is often a chronic disorder that produces significant morbidity when not properly diagnosed and treated. The mainstay of treatment includes cognitive behavioral therapy and medication management. The use of clomipramine in the 1960s and then the introduction of serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the 1980s represented important advances in the pharmacologic treatment of OCD. Despite effective treatment modalities, many patients demonstrate only a partial response or are resistant to available medications. SRI-resistant OCD is one of the few diagnoses in modern psychiatry for which invasive neurosurgical procedures remain part of the established treatment armamentarium. We review current treatment strategies used in the management of OCD symptoms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",,,5DPWGBR6,0,behavior,867

This study aims to investigate the inter-relationships between depressive symptoms, cognition and cerebrovascular disease using a well-characterised prospective cohort. METHOD: Data came from waves 1 (2005-2007) and 2 (2007-2009) of the Sydney Memory and Ageing Study (n = 462; mean age = 78.3 years). RESULTS: At wave 1, there was an association between depressive symptoms and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume [b = 0.016, t(414) = 2.34, p = 0.020]. Both depressive symptoms [b = -0.058, t(413) = -2.64, p = 0.009] and WMH volume [b = -0.011, t(413) = -3.77, p < 0.001], but not stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA) [b = -0.328, t(413) = -1.90, p = 0.058], were independently associated with lower cognition. Prospectively, cerebrovascular disease was not found to predict increasing depressive symptoms [stroke/TIA: b = -0.349, t(374.7) = -0.76, p = 0.448; WMH volume: b = 0.007, t(376.3) = 0.875, p = 0.382]. Depressive symptoms predicted increasing WMH severity [b = 0.012, t(265.9) = -3.291, p = 0.001], but not incident stroke/TIA (odds ratio = 0.995; CI 0.949-1.043; p = 0.820). When examined in separate models, depressive symptoms [b = -0.027, t(373.5) = -2.16, p = 0.032] and a history of stroke/TIA [b = -0.460, t(361.2) = -4.45, p < 0.001], but not WMH volume [b = 0.001, t(362.3) = -0.520, p = 0.603], predicted declines in cognition. When investigated in a combined model, a history of stroke/TIA remained a predictor of cognitive decline [b = -0.443, t(360.6) = -4.28, p < 0.001], whilst depressive symptoms did not [b = -0.012, t(359.7) = -0.96, p = 0.336]. CONCLUSIONS: This study is contrasted with previous prospective studies which indicate that depressive symptoms predict cognitive decline independently of vascular disease.

J.; Goodrich, S.; Ogata, S.","OBJECTIVE: This study analyzed psychological representations in 58 subjects in order to achieve a better understanding of the relation between adult borderline personality disorder and reported histories of childhood sexual and physical abuse. METHOD: The subjects were 29 inpatients with borderline personality disorder diagnosed according to the Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines, 14 nonborderline inpatients with major depressive disorder according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria, and 15 normal comparison subjects recruited from the community and screened for the absence of psychopathology. Earliest memories were used as the source of mental representations in all subjects. The memories were reliably coded for malevolent affect tone, presence of deliberate injury, and effectiveness of helpers. Family histories of childhood sexual and physical abuse were obtained with the Familial Experiences Interview, a structured interview. Abuse histories for a subset of the subjects were corroborated by interviews with family members. RESULTS: A reported history of sexual abuse, but not a reported history of physical abuse, predicted the presence of extremely malevolent representations in these earliest memories as well as representations involving deliberate injury. These two kinds of representations also discriminated borderline patients who reported histories of sexual abuse from borderline patients who did not report sexual abuse. Mean affect tone (from malevolent to benevolent) did not, however, discriminate sexually abused or physically abused subjects. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that malevolent representations associated with the borderline diagnosis in previous research may be partially related to a history of childhood sexual abuse.

C.; Gomez-Beldarrain, Marian; Carrasco, Maria; Bilbao, Amaia; Garcia-Monco, Juan C.","Chronic migraine patients are at risk of developing a medication overuse. Brain functional studies in these patients have demonstrated an orbitofrontal hypometabolism, persistent after overuse cessation. Orbitofrontal dysfunction is also present in addiction and thus could predispose migraineurs to medication overuse. The aim of this study was to investigate if orbitofrontal dysfunction can be demonstrated in patients with chronic migraine and medication overuse by performing a systematic neuropsychological evaluation focused on tests that assess frontal lobe function. Second, to establish whether it is related to the outcome of these patients. We prospectively studied 42 chronic migraine patients with medication overuse, 42 episodic migraineurs and 41 controls on a battery of neuropsychological tasks evaluating the orbitofrontal and dorsolateral functioning. Depression, anxiety, and personality traits were also assessed. Chronic migraineurs with medication overuse showed a significant impairment in orbitofrontal task performance and higher depression scores as compared to episodic migraineurs and controls. Dorsolateral dysfunction was present in both groups of migraneurs, who also had higher rates of anxiety as compared to controls. After 1 year of follow-up, migraine patient's outcome was classified according to their medication overuse status. A negative outcome that included persistent or new-onset medication overuse was present in 34 \ \% \ of migraineurs and was associated with baseline poor orbitofrontal task performance, and with mild dorsolateral dysfunction, higher rates of depression, anxiety and neuroticism-anxiety traits. Formal education and years with migraine did not influence outcome. Orbitofrontal dysfunction is present in patients with chronic migraine and medication overuse, and associates with a poor outcome at 1 year of follow-up. Neuropsychological evaluation in migraine may help to detect patients prone to overuse so that appropriate therapeutic attitudes can be taken. \ \textcopyright \ The Author(s) 2011.",2011.0,10.1007/s10194-011-0340-6,E9V38U8U,0,personality,873
873,Comparison of insight among schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients in remission of affective and positive symptoms: analysis and critique.,"Braw, Y.; Sitman, R.; Sela, T.; Erez, G.; Bloch, Y.; Levkovitz, Y.","BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are associated with impairments in insight, leading to a poorer clinical outcome and functioning. Earlier studies comparing the two disorders on the basis of insight included inpatients or patients who were clinically symptomatic. The current study therefore assessed patients in remission of affective symptoms and positive symptoms of schizophrenia. METHODS: Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients (n=32, n=34; respectively) underwent clinical and functional evaluations. Insight was assessed using the Scale to assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder (SUMD) and the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). Attention was assessed using a continuous performance task (CANTAB's rapid visual information processing). RESULTS: Schizophrenia patients displayed poorer insight into having a mental disorder and into the social consequences thereof compared to the bipolar disorder patients. They were also less aware of their anhedonia-asociality. Age, however, was significantly correlated with insight and differences in insight between the patient groups became nonsignificant when age was used as a covariate in the statistical analyses. Age was not a moderating variable of the relationship between diagnosis and insight. CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences in insight held by the two patient groups might be related to age disparities between patient groups. Earlier studies did not adequately address these age differences, their cause and their potential effects on findings. These issues are explored with regard to the findings of the current study, as well as earlier studies, emphasizing the need for further research of the relationship between age and insight.",2012.0,10.1016/j.eurpsy.2011.02.002,LLJLJWBI,0,cognitive,874

The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence, characteristics and functions of NSSI among adolescents in community settings, and to explore risk factors related to this behavior. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and seventy-five adolescents aged 12 to 17 were recruited randomly from different High Schools in Israel. They completed self-report questionnaires assessing NSSI (Ottawa Self-Injury Inventory), depression (Children's Depression Inventory - CDI) and impulsivity (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale - BIS-II). RESULTS: In the past year, 20.7 \ \% \ of the participants reported engaging NSSI at least once. Among them, 42.1 \ \% \ declared they are still engaging in NSSI at the present. Motives for NSSI were internal emotion regulation reasons, external emotion regulation reasons for social influences. In addition, the NSSI group reported significantly higher levels of depressive, impulsivity and suicidal ideations. Depressive symptoms were found as significant predictors of NSSI in the future. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: High rates of NSSI among community adolescents were found. Depression, impulsivity and suicidal ideation were found significantly related to NSSI.

F.","What changes and how quickly these changes occur as a result of therapy in borderline personality disorder (BPD) is an important ongoing question. The features of BPD patients that are most predictive of rates of change in such patients remain largely unknown. Using the Cornell Personality Disorders Institute (CPDI) randomized controlled trial data, we sought to determine (a) the number and nature of broad domains underlying a large number of rate of change (slope) measures across many psychological, psychiatric, and psychosocial indexes, and (b) which baseline individual difference psychological features of the BPD patients correlated with these rate of change domains. We examined the latent structure of slope (rate of change) measures gleaned from individual growth curves for each subject, studied in multiwave perspective, on separate measures of anger, aggression, impulsivity, depression, global functioning, and social adjustment. Three broad domains of change rate could be discerned. These domains were reflected in factors that are described as (a) anger/aggression change ( aggressive dyscontrol ), (b) global functioning/social adjustment change ( social adjustment/self-acceptance ), and (c) anxiety/depression/impulsivity change ( conflict tolerance/behavioral control ). Factor scores were computed for each change domain and baseline measures of personality and psychodynamic features, selected a priori, were correlated with these factor scores. Multiple regression analyses revealed (a) baseline negative affectivity and aggression predicted the aggressive dyscontrol change domain, (b) baseline identity diffusion predicted the social adjustment/self-acceptance change domain, and (c) baseline social potency predicted the conflict tolerance/behavioral control change domain. These baseline predictors suggest potential research foci for understanding those aspects of BPD that change at comparable rates over time.",2012.0,,927RHKL9,0,psychodynamic,876

Commonly used psychometric scales share several features leading to questions about whether they reflect distinguishable concepts. Study participants were 822 employees of the Augsburg Cohort Study (mean age 40 years, 89 \ \% \ men). The authors analyzed the interrelationship between the following psychosocial measures by applying Pearson correlations and factor analysis to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Type D Personality (DS14), the Maastricht Vital Exhaustion Questionnaire (VE), Social Support (F-SozU), the SF12 Health Survey, and Effort-Reward Imbalance. Although the full correlation matrix revealed low to medium associations supporting the notion that the applied psychometric scales show some conceptual overlap, factor analyses resulted in 13 distinguishable and interpretable factors, considerably reflecting the original psychometric scales. This strengthens the assumption that the psychometric scales used constitute distinct psychological concepts, in particular, depressive symptomatology and negative affectivity versus vital exhaustion.",2004.0,10.3200/BMED.30.1.35-44,WWIEL99K,0,personality,877

Our objective was to determine whether maladaptive coping styles are associated with recent glaucoma progression or worse visual field mean deviation. A hospital-based case-control study was conducted in the Glaucoma Service of Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital in Montreal, Canada. Patients with primary open angle glaucoma or normal tension glaucoma with ?4 years of follow-up and ?5 Humphrey visual fields were included. Cases had recent visual field progression as defined according to the Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial pattern change probability maps. Controls had stable visual fields. The Brief Cope questionnaire, a 28-item questionnaire about 14 different ways of coping with the stress of a chronic disease, was asked. Questions were also asked about demographic and medical factors, and the medical chart was examined. Outcomes included glaucoma progression (yes, no) and visual field mean deviation. Logistic and linear regressions were used. A total of 180 patientswere included (82 progressors and 98 nonprogressors). Although none of the 14 coping scaleswere associated with glaucoma progression (P \textgreater 0.05), higher denial was correlated with worse visual field mean deviation (r=0.173, P=0.024). In a linear regressionmodel including age, sex, education, depression, intraocular pressure, and family history of glaucoma, greater levels of denial (b=1.37, 95 \% confidence interval [CI]2.32, 0.41), Haitian ethnicity (b=7.78, 95 \% CI12.52, 3.04), and the number of glaucoma medications (b=1.20, 95 \% CI 2.00, 0.38) were statistically significantly associated with visual field mean deviation.

878,Editor's introduction.,"Friedman, Richard C.","This editorial provides an overview of the articles featured in the present issue of Psychodynamic Psychiatry. The articles in this issue of the journal present a refreshingly modern albeit sometimes sobering perspective about older-age patients. They attest to the need for a developmental, bio-psycho-social model in order to carry out adequate assessment and treatment planning. One of the article suggests that both early life and present experience shape the context within which depression occurs. Thus, attachment style, a function of early life experience, may buffer patients, especially men, against late life depression. This research illustrates how important it is for mental health providers to be aware of the quality of relationships of a depressed person, not simply how many people are in their social network. Another article points out that subsyndromal depressions are more common than reported in epidemiological studies. The database on extremely elderly people say 80-100 or older is relatively scant, and it stands to reason that various types of losses are common among this age group and that these impinge on their quality of life.

This study aimed to investigate the added value of brief behavioral therapy for insomnia over treatment as usual (TAU) for residual depression and refractory insomnia. METHOD: Thirty-seven outpatients (mean age of 50.5 years) were randomly assigned to TAU alone or TAU plus brief behavioral therapy for insomnia, consisting of 4 weekly 1-hour individual sessions. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores (primary outcome), sleep parameters, and GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (GRID-HAMD) scores were assessed by blind raters and remission rates for both insomnia and depression were collected at 4- and 8-week follow-ups. The patients were recruited from February 18, 2008, to April 9, 2009. RESULTS: Brief behavioral therapy for insomnia plus TAU resulted in significantly lower ISI scores than TAU alone at 8 weeks (P \textless .0005). The sleep efficiency for the combination was also significantly better than that for TAU alone (P = .015). Significant differences were observed in favor of the combination group on both the total GRID-HAMD scores (P = .013) and the GRID-HAMD scores after removing the 3 sleep items (P = .008). The combination treatment produced higher rates of remission than TAU alone, both in terms of insomnia (50 \% vs 0 \% ), with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 2 (95 \% CI, 1-4), and in terms of depression (50 \% vs 6 \% ), with an NNT of 2 (95 \% CI, 1-5). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with residual depression and treatment refractory insomnia, adding brief behavioral therapy for insomnia to usual clinical care produced statistically significant and clinically substantive added benefits.

Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) seems to be key in MDD. The aims of the present study were therefore two-fold, to investigate in a three-arm interventional study the differential effects of ECT, ECT plus AET, and AET alone in patients suffering from TR-MDD on 1. depressive symptoms and 2. BDNF METHODS: 60 patients with TR-MDD (mean age: 31 years; 31.6% female patients) were randomly assigned either to the ECT, ECT + AET, or AET condition. The AET condition consisted of treadmill exercise for 30 min, three times a week. Both depression severity and BDNF levels were assessed at baseline and 4 weeks later. All patients were further treated with an SSRI standard medication. RESULTS: BDNF levels increased over time in all three study conditions. After completion of the intervention program, the ECT group showed significantly higher BDNF levels compared to the ECT + AET and the AET conditions. Depressive symptoms decreased in all three conditions over time. The combination of ECT + AET led to a significantly greater decrease than in either the ECT or AET alone conditions. BDNF levels were not associated with symptoms of depression. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of results suggests that ECT, AET and particularly their combination are promising directions for treatment patients suffering from TR-MDD, and that it remains unclear to what extent BDNF is key and a reliable biomarker for TR-MDD.",2014.0,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2014.06.018,CSHJ8C9F,0,diathesis,882

Malignant glioma (MG) is a devastating neuro-oncologic disease with almost invariably poor prognosis. Prognostic awareness (PA) is the awareness of incurable disease and shortened life expectancy (LE). Accurate PA is associated with favorable psychological outcomes at the end of life (EoL) for patients with cancer; however, little is known about PA or prognostic communication in MG. Moreover, research has yet to evaluate the impact of cognitive impairment on PA and preferred forms of communication. Methods. Fifty MG patients and 32 paired caregivers were evaluated in this exploratory study with a semi-structured PA assessment aimed to measure their awareness of MG incurability and LE. Full PA was defined as awareness of MG incurability and accurate estimate of LE. The assessment included a survey about preferences for prognostic communication (items from the Prognosis and Treatment Perceptions Questionnaire), neurocognitive assessment (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised, Trail Making Test Parts A and B, and the Controlled Oral Word Association Test), and measurements of mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain [FACT-Br]). Results. Twenty (40%) patients and 22 (69%) caregivers had full PA. Thirty (60%) patients and 23 (72%) caregivers reported that prognostic information was extremely or very important, and 21 (42%) patients and 16 (50%) caregivers desired more prognostic information. Patients with memory impairment more frequently believed that prognostic information was important (P = 0.04, P = 0.03) and desired more information (P = 0.05, P = 0.003) as compared with those without impairment. Conclusions. Most MG patients were unaware of their LE. Memory impairment may influence preferences for prognostic information.",2017.0,10.1093/neuonc/nox117,BTAL6PDG,0,additional,883
883,"Utilization of a self-contained psychometry-oriented device, for study of affective and cognitive function of a subject .","Nouguier-Soule, J.; Nouguier, J.; Bicakova-Rocher, A.; Gorceix, A.; Reinberg, A.","We appraised the possibility to use the Psycho-Log 24, an ambulatory, adapted to chronopsychometry device, which realizes simplified questionnaires and performance test adaptable to each subject; this device has dimensions like a pocketbook; its storage capacity is compatible with a long time use. 9 adult volunteers (8 healthy subjects and 1 depressive patient) participated to this study. All of them effected reaction times (TRS) during 3 to 31 days at the rate of at least 4 sessions/day; some of them completed mental calculations (CM), letters cancellations (BRL) and auto-estimation scales (from 1 to 9 items, also measured by a classic method). For TRS and all the subjects, the frequencies histograms calculated by hour and on a 24 h scale, showed a bimodal variation, with a major peak suggesting a circadian rhythm. 5 subjects had different time for the daily best performances of each hand (shifted from 5 to 12 h). In the healthy adults, for BRL and CM, the best performances in speed and precision are shifted and could be related to the fatigue auto-estimated peaks. There is a significant correlation between auto-estimations by Psycho-Log and the classic method. The coherence between the auto-estimations of the depressive subject is strong during the remission stage, and lower during the relapse stage. The used method seems an effective mean to know the temporal structure of the cognitive and affective functions of a subject, and to estimate the preserving of this structure; the method first could constitute an exploratory mean for an objective evaluation of the drugs effects and patients quality of life, secondly could be implicated in researches with diagnosis target.",1999.0,,ZQ389MJV,0,cognitive,884
884,Toward a unified conception of the origins of sexual and social deviancy in young persons.,"Limentani, A.","This paper is based on the empirical evidence that social and sexual deviancy in young persons often succeed on one another, alternate repeatedly, or occur concomitantly. The role of the superego and the relationship of acting out and symptomatic acts to both conditions are explored. States of excitement, tension, and discharge in young persons are described. The scanty but important literature on excitement is reviewed, and the role of this affect in the causation of both deviances is examined in some detail. The occurrence of early fantasies associated with (primary) excitement on a background of early psychic disturbance and environmental failure, common to both deviations, is compared with excitement in later stages of development. The fantasies that accompany physiological and psychological changes at puberty and adolescence provoke arousal and excitation, which is defended against with boredom and depression, which in turn leads to a search for (secondary) excitement. This process is illustrated by several clinical examples drawn from case material of patients treated with psychotherapy and psychoanalysis. Finally, the implications for treatment of a unified approach to the problem of social and sexual deviancy in young people is briefly explored.",1984.0,,MC7L6FYT,0,psychodynamic,885
885,Psychological consequences of socially mandated stigma concealment.,"Dudley, Michael George","This study investigated the impact of socially mandated stigma concealment on individuals' psychological well-being and cognitive processing. Whereas much past research has delineated the advantages and disadvantages of stigma disclosure, much less research has investigated stigma concealment. To study these effects, stigmatized participants (gays/lesbians) were asked either to conceal or to disclose their sexual orientation status to an interaction partner during a brief, getting-acquainted conversation. For comparison purposes, an additional sample of non-stigmatized participants (heterosexuals) were also included in this study and were likewise asked to either conceal or disclose their sexual orientation status. As predicted, mandated concealment of personally relevant identity information from others engendered negative consequences, both affective and cognitive. In most cases, these same effects were demonstrated whether such information is culturally stigmatized or not (i.e., among heterosexual as well as gay/lesbian participants), indicating that reactions to such concealment are rather uniform in nature. Specifically, in comparison to individuals who disclosed such information, individuals who were required to conceal personally relevant information reported increased levels of negative affect and higher levels of secrecy, thought suppression, and preoccupation. Such concealment, however, did not seem to affect participants' self-esteem or perceptions of the interactions. Several possible directions for future research are suggested to better establish the generalizability of these findings in more realistic encounters.

886,Rabies or a psychiatric disorder? A rare case report,"Mirhosseini, M. M.; Bidaki, R. and","The rabies virus entered the body, the virus moves towards the brain along the nerves. Manifestations of rabies appear after 10 to 50 days from entrance of virus to the body. The first symptoms of the disease in humans include:pain at the bite site, a general feeling of illness, depression, headache, nausea, and vomiting. As the virus begins to proliferation and multiply in the spinal cord or brain, neurological symptoms would appear, including anxiety, confusion, excessive saliva production, hallucinations, high level of excitement, insomnia, restlessness, paralysis of lower legs, voice box spasms and problems swallowing due to painful throat. Pseudorabies where the person after an animal bite behaves as if he is afflicted with rabies, is well introduced in literature and it is one of differential diagnoses of rabies. A 27-yearold, single male with hypochondriasis, had an overvalued idea that he had contracted rabies. The patient failed to respond to multiple somatic therapies and twice made a serious suicide attempt. The patient believed in that he is rabid and attack to persons for biting them and bitted himself. The psychodynamics of the present case is various.

We do, however, have insufficient knowledge about the extent of psychiatric treatment provided in our prisons. The aim of the present study was to give a comprehensive description of all non-pharmacological interventions provided by the psychiatric health services to a stratified sample of prison inmates. METHODS: Six medium/large prisons (n = 928) representing 1/3 of the Norwegian prison population and with female and preventive detention inmates over-sampled, were investigated cross-sectionally. All non-pharmacological psychiatric interventions, excluding pure correctional programs, were recorded. Those receiving interventions were investigated further and compared to the remaining prison population. RESULTS: A total of 230 of the 928 inmates (25 \ \% \ ) had some form of psychiatric intervention: 184 (20 \ \% \ ) were in individual psychotherapy, in addition 40 (4 \ \% \ ) received ad hoc interventions during the registration week. Group therapy was infrequent (1 \ \% \ ). The psychotherapies were most often of a supportive (62 \ \% \ ) or behavioural-cognitive (26 \ \% \ ) nature. Dynamic, insight-oriented psychotherapies were infrequent (8 \ \% \ ). Concurrent psychopharmacological treatment was prevalent (52 \ \% \ ). Gender and age did not correlate with psychiatric interventions, whereas prisoner category (remanded, sentenced, or preventive detention) did (p \ \textless \ 0.001). Most inmates had a number of defined problem areas, with substance use, depression, anxiety, and personality disorders most prevalent. Three percent of all inmates were treated for a psychotic disorder. Remand prisoners averaged 14 sessions per week per 100 inmates, while sentenced inmates and those on preventive detention averaged 22 and 25 sessions per week per 100 inmates, respectively. Five out of six psychiatric health services estimated the inmates' psychiatric therapy needs as adequately met, both overall and in the majority of individual cases. CONCLUSION: Our results pertain only to prisons with adequate primary and mental health services and effective diversion from prison of individuals with serious mental disorders. Given these important limitations, we do propose that the service estimates found may serve as a rough guideline to the minimum number of sessions a prison's psychiatric health services should be able to fulfil in order to serve the inmates psychiatric needs. The results rely on the specialist services' own estimates only. Future studies should take other important informants, including the inmates themselves, into consideration.",2006.0,10.1186/1471-244X-6-27,P9KYB3NJ,0,personality,888
888,"The relationship between interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety disorders and major depression.","Wilhelm, Kay; Boyce, Philip; Brownhill, Suzanne","BACKGROUND: While interpersonal sensitivity, as rated by the Interpersonal Sensitivity Measure (IPSM) has previously been found to be an efficient predictor of depression, there has been less interest in the relationship between the IPSM and anxiety disorders. This study examines the performance of the IPSM in discriminating between cases and non-cases of the various anxiety disorders. The contribution of depression and the perception of parental environment, to any relationships found, are also examined. METHODS: A cohort of 156 men and women has been assessed at 5-yearly intervals since baseline in 1978, in their last year of teacher training. In this fourth wave of follow-up, subjects completed a series of self-report questionnaires, including the IPSM, and scales measuring neuroticism and trait depression. Perceived parental environment, measured at baseline, was also included. DSM-III-R major depression and anxiety disorders were generated using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The IPSM subscales were moderately stable over time. 'Timidity' was associated with agoraphobia and simple phobia, and 'separation anxiety' with agoraphobia, panic disorder and generalised anxiety disorder. 'Separation anxiety' and 'timidity' showed differential gender effects for simple phobia. 'Fragile inner self' and 'separation anxiety' were associated with subjects with a history of repeated episodes of major depression, and the former, with perception of poor parental care. LIMITATIONS: The IPSM was not available for inclusion prior to the 1988 wave. CONCLUSIONS: While the IPSM subscales were consistently correlated with neuroticism, they displayed differential associations with specific anxiety disorders, episodes of major depression and early parental environment. These findings offer greater understanding of mechanisms concerning the relationship of vulnerability to anxiety disorders and depression.",2004.0,10.1016/S0165-0327(02)00069-1,679TS6WS,0,personality,889

M.; Tashjian, M.; Yang, R. K.; Najarian, L. M.; Fairbanks, L. A.","Objective: This study evaluated basal salivary cortisol, 3-methoxy-4- hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), and cortisol suppression following dexamethasone administration in adolescents exposed to two levels of earthquake-related trauma. Method: Five years after the 1988 earthquake, saliva samples were obtained from 37 adolescents from two cities in Armenia at different distances from the epicenter. Baseline saliva samples were obtained at 8:00 a.m., 4:00 p.m., and 11:00 p.m., following which 0.5 mg of dexamethasone was administered. Nine and 17 hours later, saliva samples were again obtained. Subjects were evaluated for posttraumatic stress and depressive reactions through use of self-report instruments. Results: Significantly lower mean baseline 8:00 a.m. cortisol levels and greater day 2 4:00 p.m. cortisol suppression following dexamethasone were observed in the more symptomatic adolescents living in the city closer to the epicenter. Of the three symptom categories of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), only intrusion (category B) symptoms were significantly correlated with basal morning cortisol levels and percent suppression by dexamethasone. The more highly exposed adolescents were exhibited a more rapid decline in MHPG levels over the course of day 1. Conclusions: The findings indicate that chronic posttraumatic stress reactions among adolescents exposed to catastrophic disaster are associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis alterations. The findings are congruent with those previously described in adults with chronic PTSD. Persistent intrusion (category B) symptoms may constitute continued episodes of distress and evoke repeated physiological stress responses, which, over time, alter HPA axis function. The MHPG findings suggest that there may be diurnal changes associated with severity of posttraumatic stress symptoms.",1996.0,,ZJ9U3X66,0,diathesis,890

The duration and severity of complaints, combined with previously failed treatments, makes them unsuitable for treatment in primary care. Design: A prospective waiting list controlled study. Patients: A total of 32 patients with chronic pain for at least one year and severe disuse syndrome were included in an inpatient multidisciplinary cognitive behavioural treatment. Methods: Patients were assessed before the waiting list period, before the clinical phase, after the clinical phase and after follow-ups of 6 months and one year. The visual analogue scale for pain and fatigue were assessed. Muscle strength of the arms and legs, arm endurance and a 6-minute walking test were used to assess physical outcome. The Symptom Checklist-90, RAND-36, pain cognition list and the Tampa scale for kinesiophobia were used to assess psychological outcome. Results: Long-term significant (p \textless 0.001) improvements were found for pain, fatigue, walking distance, muscle strength, anxiety, depression, somatization, negative self-efficacy, and catastrophizing in the intervention period.

Here we examine whether any such vulnerability links are cognitively mediated. METHODS: We study a sample of 96 clinically depressed patients who reported an identifiable 'cognitive schema' being activated when depressed. We examine for significant associations between early adverse events and later precipitants to the patients' depression, and then assess the extent to which any identified links are cognitively mediated. RESULTS: Qualitative analyses suggested quite strong associations between early childhood experiences and identified schemas, while the quantitative analyses identified few links. LIMITATIONS: These contrasting results may present a challenge to the hypothesis or reflect methodological limitations, and we therefore detail some of the complexities involved in identifying cognitive schemas.",2000.0,,AA6BNQSJ,0,psychodynamic,893
893,Addressing cultural contexts in the management of stress via narrative and mobile technology.,"Lee, Matthew D.; Kang, Xiao; Hanrahan, Nancy","In developing applications for stress management and mental health, developers have largely ignored cultural context in design, opting instead to produce apps for a general audience. However, apps designed without a specific population in mind actually have limited reach. Generally stress trackers and so-called therapists in your pocket , tend to be lost among a jungle of other generic apps that appeal only to the quantified self population and those already predisposed to help-seeking behavior. To reach a broader audience, designing for a specific population may have appeal. The AppHappy Project's Journey to the West is a mobile app being developed by a multidisciplinary group of students at the University of Pennsylvania. The objective is to promote better stress management and mental health among Asian international college students and facilitate their social integration with the general student population. With a prevalence of depression twice that of domestic college students, a reluctance to engage in help-seeking behavior due to stigma, and the challenge of cultural integration, creating interventions for this population requires a different approach to app-mediated therapy. Journey to the West packages bite-sized pieces of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy techniques within the framework of a role-playing game. Every element of its design-from its characters to its art style, from its narrative to its mechanics to its approach to community features-is rooted in a culturally appropriate context. An avatar serves as a surrogate of self while experiencing externalized stressors. Each quest blends therapeutic elements into gameplay with the goal of building resilience towards stressful events.

894,Depression and the global economic crisis: Is there hope?,"authorship Indicated, No","This editorial discusses effects of depression and the global economic crisis. The utterly devastating nature of depression is clear if one considers that many people with the illness prefer death to life with their symptoms. More than 50 \ \% \ of people who die by suicide will have had a depressive episode at the time of death. The burden of depression worldwide is huge. Current WHO estimates put unipolar depressive disorders third in the global burden of disease league table. They are expected to overtake lower respiratory infections and diarrhea diseases by 2030. Prevention of depression is an under-researched area that deserves greater attention. Since the underlying cause of some people's depression will be dysfunctional beliefs and thought processes built up from early learning experiences, some prevention strategies have involved psychoeducational interventions designed to strengthen resilience. Interventions such as school based problem-solving programs and behavioral child-rearing strategies for parents have shown modest but real reductions in incident depressive episodes, as have exercise programs for older people. Prevention, at all stages of life, forms a prominent part of WHO's draft Global Mental Health Action Plan for 2013-20. Governments can certainly not afford to ignore the burden of mental disorders. According to World Economic Forum estimates, the global cost of mental illness in terms of lost economic output was US \ \$ \ 2.5 trillion in 2010, and could reach \ \$ \ 6.0 trillion by 2030. And so we return to the global economic crisis, and the dangerous undertow of austerity. Job losses and tax rises might be inevitable, but governments must not cut back on the social protection systems and mental health services that could aid recovery, economic or otherwise.

We examined the hypothesis that ineffective emotional interference control may impact working memory (WM) performance by disrupting information encoding, maintenance, or retrieval in SCZ. Twenty-eight SCZ and 28 matched healthy controls (HC) performed the visual and verbal delayed-matching-to-sample task (DMST) with trials preceded by negative and nonemotional visual distractors. Event-Related Potentials associated with affective stimuli processing (Late Positive Potential-LPP) and WM-encoding (target-P3), maintenance (Negative Slow Wave-NSW), and retrieval (probe-P3) were analyzed. Patients showed overall worse DMST accuracy than HC. Emotional distraction negatively impacted accuracy during the verbal DMST in both groups combined. Both groups also displayed similar LPP modulation during the presentation of emotional distractors. HC showed enhanced NSW after presentation of a negative distraction, whereas this did not occur in SCZ. Comparable effects of emotional distraction were found for WM-encoding and retrieval in both groups. While emotional and neutral stimuli differentially impacted WM-maintenance on the neural level in HC, we did not observe this effect in SCZ, even though both groups showed similar behavioral and neurophysiological reactions to affective stimuli. Deficits in inhibitory mechanisms in SCZ may be responsible for this effect and may have particular relevance for WM-maintenance difficulties.",2018.0,10.3758/s13415-018-0578-4,SBXYTYHB,0,additional,896
896,Clinical Predictors of Response to Magnetic Seizure Therapy in Depression: A Preliminary Report,"Kayser, S.; Bewernick, B. H.; Wagner, S.; Schlaepfer, T. E.","OBJECTIVES: Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a novel convulsive brain stimulation method in clinical testing, which is used as an alternative for electroconvulsive therapy in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Preliminary studies have suggested that MST leads to fewer cognitive adverse effects than electroconvulsive therapy but has similar efficacy. However, the clinical predictors of response to MST have not been evaluated yet. This study aimed to investigate whether these predictors can be identified in patients with TRD. METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with TRD were included. As clinical predictors for treatment response, we used the diagnosis, sex, age, family history, and severity of depression, as well as the melancholic, psychotic, anxiety, and atypical depression symptoms. A response was defined as an improvement higher than 50% on the 28-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. The binary logistic regression, stepwise linear regression, and effect sizes were calculated. RESULTS: We found that 68.4% of the patients responded to MST. The responders had significantly fewer previous depressive episodes, less severe depression, and fewer melancholic (anhedonia) and anxiety symptoms than the nonresponders. In addition, responders were more likely to have a positive family history of depression than nonresponders. In particular, the number of previous episodes and a family history of depression were significant predictors of the response to MST. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the chronicity, severity, and family history of depression, as well as the presence of melancholic and anxiety symptoms, can serve as clinical predictors of the response to MST. Further research with a larger sample size will be required to verify these preliminary findings.",2018.0,10.1097/yct.0000000000000495,MJZ3BE23,0,additional,897

As a secondary objective, the relationship between treatment outcome and 7 predictor variables was investigated. METHOD: Patients were enrolled between April 2001 and September 2003 and were randomly assigned to treatment. Academic and nonacademic clinical sites participated. Each treatment modality lasted 1 year. Pharmacotherapists were free to choose between 5 SSRIs currently marketed in The Netherlands. Outcome was assessed after 9 months of treatment (posttest 1), after discontinuation of treatment (posttest 2), and 6 and 12 months after treatment discontinuation (follow-up 1 and follow-up 2). RESULTS: In the sample (N = 150), 48 \% did not suffer from agoraphobia or suffered from only mild agoraphobia, while 52 \% suffered from moderate or severe agoraphobia. Patients in each treatment group improved significantly from pretest to posttest 1 on the primary outcome measures of level of anxiety (P \textless .001), degree of coping (P \textless .001), and remitter status (P \textless .001), as well as on the secondary outcome measures of depressive symptomatology (P \textless .001), and from pretest to posttest 2 for health-related quality of life (P \textless .001). Gains were preserved from posttest 2 throughout the follow-up period. Some superiority of CBT + SSRI and SSRI as compared with CBT was observed at posttest 1. However, at both follow-ups, differences between treatment modalities proved nonsignificant. Client satisfaction appeared to be high at treatment endpoint, while patients receiving CBT + SSRI appeared slightly (P \textless .05) more satisfied than those receiving CBT only. CONCLUSIONS: No fall-off in gains was observed for either treatment modality after treatment discontinuation. SSRIs were associated with adverse events. Gains produced by CBT were slower to emerge than those produced by CBT + SSRI and SSRI, but CBT ended sooner.

METHODS: A total of 300 employees from a company in western Japan were invited to participate in the study. Those who consented to enter the study were assigned to an intervention (n=149) or waiting list control group (n=151). Participants in the intervention group received a small-group stress management program. The program was primarily aimed at increasing knowledge about stress and improving coping skills. To investigate the intervention effect, change scores in outcome variables were calculated by subtracting the scores at pre-intervention from those at post-intervention (8 weeks after the pre-intervention survey). Next, the difference in the scores between groups was examined using analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) with the pre-intervention score as the covariate. RESULTS: Favorable intervention effects were found on knowledge about stress and on coping skills (P<0.001 and P=0.012, respectively) and adverse effects on psychological distress (P=0.022). However, this adverse effect on psychological distress did not exist among those who initially perceived higher levels of job control.

901,Is the cognitive-behavioral therapy an effective intervention to prevent the postnatal depression? A critical review.,"Nardi, Bernardo; Laurenzi, Sabrina and","Objective: The aim of this article is to review and discuss the efficacy of the Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), in the prevention of postnatal depression (PD) in pregnant women at risk. Method: PubMed, Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched from February 1991 to February 2011. Results: Eight Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) on the prevention of PD with the CBT were selected and their data were analyzed. The literature analyzed recommends that depression in pregnancy requires an efficient management to provide mother's symptoms relief as well as to prevent the PD. While several studies demonstrated the efficacy of the CBT in the treatment of PD, the efficacy of the CBT in preventing PD in pregnant women at risk has been investigated only by a few studies, presenting a number of methodological flaws.

Methods: Depressed (n=. 37) and healthy participants (n=. 35) were assessed before and after treatment using a clinical interview, a task to measure baseline EEG, and questionnaires of behavioral activation and inhibition, avoidance, and affect. Results: Alpha EEG asymmetry was significantly higher in depressed than healthy participants at pre-treatment, positively correlated with negative affect and behavioral inhibition, and inversely correlated with lower behavioral activation sensitivity.

Background: The immediate postpartum period is a critical time when physical and psychological disorders are likely to occur. Immigrant women have, in general, poor perinatal and psychological results during this time. Methods: One hundred and three women at the Virgen de las Nieves University Hospital (Granada, Spain) were divided into two groups: 50 Spanish and 53 immigrants. The instruments used were the Life Orientation Test, the Stress Vulnerability Inventory, the Perceived Stress Scale and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). Sociodemographic and obstetric data were obtained from the healthcare providers reports. Results: During the postpartum period, the immigrant women had higher mean scores on the following subscales: interpersonal sensitivity (F(1,102) = 4.06; p  \textless  0.05); depression (F(1,102) = 7.24; p  \textless  0.01); phobic anxiety (F(1,102) = 4.83; p  \textless  0.05), paranoid ideation (F(1,102) = 7.20; p  \textless  0.01); and psychoticism (F(1,102) = 4.04; p  \textless  0.05).

The mixed-focus intervention produced the best overall response to surgery; the emotion-focused intervention produced the lowest adjustment levels. The Krantz Health Opinion Survey Information scale was the best overall predictor of response to surgery in conjunction with treatments. Better adjustment and satisfaction and lower self-reported pain were obtained when high information-preference subjects were given a problem-focused intervention and when low information-preference subjects were given an emotion-focused intervention; responses were relatively poor when mismatches occurred. Differences in relative use of problem- to emotion-focused coping as measured by the Ways of Coping Checklist were unrelated to adjustment or satisfaction, but differences in problem-focused coping were the best predictors of pain response in conjunction with treatments. Preoperative anxiety level was inversely related to adjustment and satisfaction and was directly related to pain, with the affective-unpleasantness component of pain primarily accounting for this association.

H.; Marsh, A.","Despite its strong relation to depression and theorized development across childhood and adolescence, cognitive schema organization has not been explored in early adolescence, a sensitive developmental period for first depression onset. Schema organization is theorized to derive from childhood cognitive internalizations of caregiving relationships, such as critical parenting experiences (e.g., Young et al. in Schema therapy: a practitioner's guide. Guilford Press, New York, 2003). Thus, the current investigation considers the organization of positive and negative schemas with youth's perceptions of parental warmth and psychological control and self-reported emotional functioning. Participants were 198 boys and girls aged 9-14 years who completed the Psychological Distance Scaling Task, measures of perceptions of parenting behaviors, anxiety symptoms and depression symptoms. Consistent with hypotheses, higher depression, but not anxiety symptoms were associated with a loosely-interconnected positive schema organization and a tightly-interconnected negative schema organization. Parental responsiveness emerged as the strongest predictor of negative schema structure.

V.; Glenthøj, L. B.; Kristensen, T. D.; Krakauer, K.; Rostrup, E.; Nordentoft, M.","Background: CAARMS criteria identifes individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) of psychosis of which approximately 30% develop psychosis within 2 years. These criteria require loss of function and a genetic predisposition or attenuated psychotic symptoms. Recent studies indicate that fewer UHR individuals have transition to psychosis, hence stratifcation of UHR individuals into subgroups (transition, nonremission, and remission) has been suggested. The search for biomarkers may prove signifcant for short-term identifcation of UHR individuals (remission/nonremission). On a long-term basis, bio-markers might give the opportunity to delay or prevent psychotic episodes. Disturbances of the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA have long been suspected to be involved in the pathophysiology of psychosis. These disorders have also been found in people at UHR, making it a promising area for early detection. Cognitive defcits in schizophrenia are present prior to the onset of psychosis and may be linked to perturbed glutamate and GABA function. Data suggest that this link is already present in UHR states. Methods: Participants: UHR individuals who meet the CAARMS criteria recruited from Mental Health Services in the Capital Region of Denmark and matching healthy controls. Examinations: 1H-MRS of the ACC and thalamus. Diagnostic and psy-chopathological tests: CAARMS, SCID, SOFAS, PSP, Cornblatt, SANS, BPRS, MADRS, YMRS, CGI, PAS, SPI-A, AQoL Cognitive tests as part of collaborative studies. Results: So far 66 UHR individuals and 25 healthy controls have been scanned (October 2016). Very early preliminary analysis of the baseline data fnds no signifcant difference in glutamate levels (in ACC and thal-amus) in UHR patients compared to matched healthy controls. Baseline data remain to be analyzed in relation to relevant subgroups of patients, for example, based on clinical outcome. GABA analysis and analysis of follow-up data are also yet to be performed. Conclusion: More studies are needed in this feld, since results so far have been diverging. Baseline data remains to be analyzed in relation to relevant subgroups of patients, for example, based on clinical outcome.

910,What a Shame: Increased Rates of OMS Resident Burnout May Be Related to the Frequency of Shamed Events During Training,"Shapiro, M. C.; Rao, S. R.; Dean, J.; Salama, A. R.","PURPOSE: Shame is an ineffective tool in residency education that often results in depression, isolation, and worse patient care. This study aimed to assess burnout, depersonalization, and personal achievement levels in current oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS) residents, to assess the prevalence of the use of shame in OMS residency training, and to determine whether there is a relation between shame exposure and resident burnout, depersonalization, and personal achievement levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous 20-question cross-sectional survey was developed incorporating the Maslach Burnout Index and a previously validated shame questionnaire and sent to all OMS program directors affiliated with the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons for distribution among their respective residents in 2016. Univariate analyses were used to determine the distribution of the predictor (shame) and outcome (burnout) by gender and by frequency of shaming events. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relation of shame to burnout. A 2-sided P value less than .05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Two hundred seventeen responses were received; 82% of respondents were men (n = 178), 95% were 25 to 34 years old (n = 206), and 58% (n = 126) were enrolled in a 4-year program. Frequently shamed residents were more likely to have depression (58 vs 22%; P < .0001), isolation (55 vs 22%; P < .0001), and poor job performance (50 vs 30%; P < .0001). Residents who were frequently shamed were more likely to experience moderate to severe burnout (odds ratio = 4.6; 95% confidence interval, 2.1-10.0; P < .001) and severe depersonalization (odds ratio = 5.1; 95% confidence interval, 2.1-12.0; P < .0001) than residents who had never or infrequently been shamed. CONCLUSION: There is a clear relation between the number of shame events and burnout and depersonalization levels. It is important to understand the negative impact that the experience of shame has on residents, including its unintended consequences.",2017.0,10.1016/j.joms.2016.08.040,BPI4RV8K,0,additional,911

H.; Kilian, H. M.; Schmidt, K.; Reinfeldt, R. E.; Kayser, S.; Coenen, V. A.; Markett, S.; Schlaepfer, T. E.","BACKGROUND: Reports of changes in patients' social behavior during deep brain stimulation (DBS) raised the question whether DBS induces changes in personality. This study explored if (1) DBS is associated with changes in personality in patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression (TRD), (2) how personality dimensions and depression are associated, and (3) if TRD patients' self-ratings of personality are valid. METHODS: TRD patients were assessed before DBS (n = 30), 6 months (t2, n = 21), 2 (t3, n = 17) and 5 years (t4, n = 11) after the initiation of DBS of the supero-lateral branch of the medial forebrain bundle (slMFB-DBS). Personality was measured with the NEO-Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), depression severity with Hamilton (HDRS), and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). RESULTS: Personality dimensions did not change with slMFB-DBS compared with baseline. Extraversion was negatively correlated with HDRS28 (r = -0.48, p < 0.05) and MADRS (r = -0.45, p < 0.05) at t2. Inter-rater reliability was high for the NEO-FFI at baseline (Cronbach's alpha = 0.74) and at t4 (alpha = 0.65). Extraversion [t(29) = -5.20; p < 0.001] and openness to experience [t(29) = -6.96; p < 0.001] differed statistically significant from the normative sample, and did not predict the antidepressant response. CONCLUSIONS: slMFB-DBS was not associated with a change in personality. The severity of depression was associated with extraversion. Personality of TRD patients differed from the healthy population and did not change with response, indicating a possible scar effect.

After each session, all clients completed the Session Evaluation Questionnaire and 75 of the clients completed the Session Impacts Scale. Session ratings indicated that sessions were perceived increasingly positively on most impact dimensions (e.g., session depth and smoothness, relationship with the therapist, feelings of understanding and problem solving, postsession positive mood) as treatment progressed. Early in treatment, PI therapy sessions were less smooth (i.e., more tense and uncomfortable) and less focused on problem solving, but PI sessions changed more rapidly than CB sessions on these dimensions, so that later in treatment, sessions of both treatments were equivalently positive. In both treatments, the trend toward more positive sessions was more rapid (i.e., the across-session slope was steeper) in 8-session treatments than in 16-session treatments. Such accelerated changes in session impact may reflect the suggested acceleration of therapeutic change associated with shorter time limits.",1996.0,,G4A8TMVW,0,psychodynamic,915

His work constitutes, in great measure, a denunciation as well as a plea: it denounces the “alienating power,” as it were, of the memory of previous generations, who tend to alienate individuals in the histories of others, histories unconnected to them that fatally retain them within a labyrinth closed to change. On the other hand, the works of Borges constitute a plea for the defence of a liberating memory for both individuals and peoples. Among the folds of the “changing shape of a memory made of oblivion” that Borges describes, the author discriminates four kinds of memories: the memory of rancor, the memory of horror, the memory of pain, and the memory of splendor. While the memories of rancor and of horror remain opposed to oblivion, to forgiveness, and to the work of mourning, the memories of pain and of splendor integrate the past into an affective restructuring and, at the same time, bring about the hard, slow, and intricate work of mourning.",2016.0,,BYSCJZJS,0,psychodynamic,917

Therefore, we hypothesized that the BIS would be useful in predicting electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)-induced seizure times and awakening from methohexital anesthesia. Twenty-five consenting patients with major depressive disorders underwent 100 maintenance ECT treatments. All patients were premedicated with glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg IV, and anesthesia was induced with methohexital 1 mg/kg IV. The BIS was monitored continuously, and the values were recorded at specific end-points, including before anesthesia (baseline), after the induction of anesthesia (pre-ECT), at the end of ECT (peak), after ECT (suppression), and on awakening (eye opening). The pre-ECT BIS value correlated with the duration of both the motor (r = 0.3) and EEG (r = 0.4) seizure activity (P \ \textless \ 0.05). The peak post-ECT BIS value correlated with the duration of the EEG seizure activity (r = 0.5) (P \ \textless \ 0.05). A positive correlation was also found between the EEG seizure duration and the time to eye opening (r = 0.4) (P \ \textless \ 0.05). However, the BIS values on awakening from methohexital anesthesia varied from 29 to 97 and were \ \textless \ 60 in 75 \ \% \ of the cases. We conclude that the BIS value before the ECT stimulus is applied could be useful in predicting the seizure time. However, the BIS values on awakening were highly variable, suggesting that it reflects both the residual depressant effects of methohexital and post-ictal depression. IMPLICATIONS: The bispectral index (BIS) value immediately before the electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) stimulus correlates with the duration of the motor and electroencephalogram (EEG) seizure activity during methohexital anesthesia. In addition, the increase in the BIS value during the ECT-induced seizure was proportional to the duration of EEG seizure activity. However, the BIS value on awakening from anesthesia varied widely, from 29 to 97.",2003.0,,9GH5NSVY,0,personality,918
918,Borderline personality disorder across the life span.,"Hunt, Melissa","Borderline personality disorder is characterized by affective dysregulation, intense, unstable interpersonal relationships, impulsivity and unstable identity. It overlaps considerably with both PTSD and bipolar spectrum disorders. Research on true late-life BPD is limited, but suggests that some of the core features of BPD including interpersonal difficulties, unstable affect and anger remain relatively unchanged, while impulsivity and identity disturbance decline or change their mode of expression in late life. Diagnosis of BPD in late life requires flexible application of the standard diagnostic criteria as well as a thorough longitudinal history. The etiology of BPD is best explained as a combination of genetic, neurobiological vulnerability combined with childhood trauma, abuse or neglect that leads to dysregulated emotions, distorted cognitions, social skills deficits, and few adaptive coping strategies. Treatment options include pharmacotherapy (especially mood stabilizers, SSRIs and atypical antipsychotics) and psychotherapeutic interventions that focus on distress tolerance, affective regulation, changing distorted beliefs, and introducing new social and relationship problem-solving skills (especially Dialectical Behavior Therapy and Schema Focused Cognitive Therapy). In late-life care environments, such as nursing homes and other residential facilities, staff need to be empowered to set appropriate limits on problematic behavior while maintaining empathy and validating the painful affect patients often experience.

Depressive disorders often follow a chronic or recurrent course. The risk of relapses increases with each additional episode. The internet-deliverable intervention strategy SUMMIT (SUpportive Monitoring and Disease Management over the InTernet) for patients with recurrent depression has been developed with the main objectives to prolong symptom-free phases and to shorten symptom-loaden phases. This paper describes the study design of a six-sites, three-arm, randomized clinical trial intended to evaluate the efficacy of this novel strategy compared to treatment as usual (TAU). Two hundred thirty six patients who had been treated for their (at least) third depressive episode in one of the six participating psychiatric centers were randomized into one of three groups: 1) TAU plus a twelve-month SUMMIT program participation with personal support or 2) TAU plus a twelve-month SUMMIT program participation without personal support, or 3) TAU alone. Primary outcome of this study is defined as the number of well weeks over 24. months after index treatment assessed by blind evaluators based on the Longitudinal Interval Follow-Up Evaluation. If efficacious, the low monetary and nonmonetary expenditures of this automated, yet individualized intervention may open new avenues for providing an acceptable, convenient, and affordable long-term disease management strategy to people with a chronic mental condition such as recurrent depression. \textcopyright 2013 Elsevier Inc.",2013.0,,MFTSKN69,0,cognitive,920

J.; Abbott, R. and","It is not known how 5-HTTLPR genotype × childhood adversity (CA) interactions that are associated with an increased risk for affective disorders in population studies operate at the neural systems level. We hypothesized that healthy adolescents at increased genetic and environmental risk for developing mood disorders (depression and anxiety) would demonstrate increased amygdala reactivity to emotional stimuli compared to those with only one such risk factor or those with none. Participants (n = 67) were classified into one of 4 groups dependent on being homozygous for the long or short alleles within the serotonin-transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) of the SLC6A4 gene and exposure to CA in the first 11. years of life (present or absent). A functional magnetic resonance imaging investigation was undertaken which involved viewing emotionally-salient face stimuli. In addition, we assessed the role of other variables hypothesized to influence amygdala reactivity, namely recent negative life-events (RNLE) assessed at ages 14 and 17, current anxiety symptoms and psychiatric history. We replicated prior findings demonstrating moderation by gene variants in 5-HTTLPR, but found no support for an effect of CA on amygdala reactivity. We also found a significant effect of RNLE aged 17 with amygdala reactivity demonstrating additive, but not interactive effects with 5-HTTLPR. A whole-brain analysis found a 5-HTTLPR × CA interaction in the lingual gyrus whereby CA appears to differentially modify neural reactivity depending on genotype. These results demonstrate that two different forms of environmental adversities interplay with 5-HTTLPR and thereby differentially impact amygdala and cortical reactivity. \textcopyright 2012 Elsevier Inc.",2012.0,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.07.067,ZJPMCB3A,0,diathesis,922

Those individuals with negative feelings toward their physical appearance also suffer from poor self-esteem, social anxiety, and a vulnerability towards depression. A negative, or unhappy body image is a significant problem that both physical and mental health professionals encounter in the difficulties and distress presented by their students and clients. Educators and mental health professionals must focus on possible interventions and methods by which negative beliefs, attitudes, feelings, and perceptions we have towards our bodies can be reduced. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of lectures and weight training on components of body image dissatisfaction among females enrolled for one semester in a university conditioning course. Data were collected from the administration of the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire (MBSRQ) as a pretest and posttest to both of the experimental groups and the control group to investigate the impact of lectures and weight training on ten components of body image dissatisfaction gain among female college students enrolled for a semester in a university women's weight conditioning course. The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Analyses of variance were utilized to answer each of the ten research questions to determine whether significant differences existed in posttest scores among the three groups. Based on the statistical findings, there was a significant difference in body image dissatisfaction gain between those students who participated in weight training combined with lectures on body image, students who participated in weight training alone, and the control group on the following five of ten components of females' body image dissatisfaction: appearance evaluation, health evaluation, health orientation, illness orientation, and body-areas satisfaction. An additional post-hoc Student's it test was utilized to determine if there was a significant difference between any two of the three groups' pairs of means on those components that were found significant.

Nationally representative data from the Add Health survey were used. The relationship of sociodemographic characteristics, known risk factors, and physical developmental timing and cognitive developmental style to suicide attempt was assessed. Depression was a risk factor for suicide attempts in both 9th and 11th grade. Other risk factors differed. Use of illegal drugs, homosexual orientation, using public assistance, and physical development were the important risk factors for ninth graders. For 11th graders, sexual abuse, being in counseling, and being of other race or ethnicity (mainly Asian or Native American) were risk factors. The cognitive development variable of using a systematic problem-solving method was protective for 11th graders.

Winnicott, Loewald, and Kohut have contributed to a revaluation of the primary process as a transitional space where rigid distinctions between subject and object are blurred so that creative and spiritual experiences can take place. My article relates to three clinical cases, outlining, in different ways, the transformative power in self and self-with-other representations inherent in a dialogue over intimate religious feelings, when beliefs and the search for spirituality are received as a crucial feature of a developing self, an essential condition for new relational patterns fostering a rediscovered sense of belonging within an accomplished sense of personal freedom. When this happens, analyst and patient may discover their shared personal disposition toward spiritual values and the transformative potential inherent in the dialogue over these issues, quite independently from the effective contents of their specific religious attitudes.

925,Cognitive-behavioural therapy augments the effects of deep brain stimulation in obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Mantione, M.; Nieman, D. H.; Figee, M.; Denys, D.","BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising new treatment for patients with treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, since most DBS patients only show a partial response, the treatment still needs to be improved. In this study we hypothesized that cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) could optimize the post-operative management in DBS and we evaluated the efficacy of CBT as augmentation to DBS targeted at the nucleus accumbens. METHOD: A total of 16 patients with treatment-refractory OCD were treated with DBS targeted at the nucleus accumbens. After stabilization of decline in OCD symptoms, a standardized 24-week CBT treatment programme was added to DBS in an open-phase trial of 8 months. Changes in obsessive-compulsive, anxiety and depressive symptoms were evaluated using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. RESULTS: Following the addition of CBT to DBS, a significant decrease in obsessive-compulsive symptoms was observed, but not in anxiety and depressive symptoms. In a subsequent double-blind phase, in which stimulation was discontinued, OCD symptoms returned to baseline (relapse) and anxiety and depressive symptoms worsened (rebound) compared with baseline. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this explorative study suggest that a combined treatment of accumbens DBS and CBT may be optimal for improving obsessive-compulsive symptoms in treatment-refractory OCD. However, a subsequent randomized controlled trial is necessary to draw firm conclusions. It seems that DBS results in affective changes that may be required to enable response prevention in CBT. This may indicate that DBS and CBT act as two complementary treatments.",2014.0,10.1017/S0033291714000956,ME87EVES,0,behavior,926

927,The impact of teacher factors on achievement and behavioural outcomes of children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): A review of the literature.,"Sherman, Jody; Rasmussen, Carmen; Baydala, Lola","Background: Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common disorder known to be associated with behavioural and academic difficulties. Several treatment options are available for children with ADHD, such as medication and behavioural therapy. Although researchers have examined the efficacy of these approaches, much less is understood about how teacher factors, including attitudes and beliefs about ADHD and treatment options, can influence students' behavioural and learning outcomes. Purpose: The goal of this review was to summarise the small set of relevant literature on the influence of teacher factors on academic and behavioural outcomes among children with ADHD, for the purpose of enhancing various outcomes for students with ADHD; to acknowledge the importance of teacher factors on student success; and to encourage additional research in this important domain. Design and methods: We searched for relevant research articles using medical (MEDLINE, 1966 to April 2008), educational (ERIC, 1966 to April 2008), and psychological (PsycInfo, 1985 to April 2008) databases. All English sources, including peer-reviewed articles, dissertation abstracts, review and opinion papers, and conference presentations or posters, were screened to determine whether they fit the predictor and dependent variables. Teacher factors were considered the predictor, or independent variables, and included search terms for factors such as attitudes, beliefs, tolerance and training. Student outcomes, including leadership, academic achievement, social skills and depression were considered the dependent variables. The population of interest was North American elementary school-aged children (grades 1 to 5-6 inclusive, with approximate ages of 5 to 12 years old) with ADHD (also searched as ADD, AD/HD, attention disorders, Attention-deficit Disorder, Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and hyper kinetic disorders). Study design was not specified, and we accepted case studies, large-sample experimental studies and descriptive educational projects. Conclusions: Teacher factors can have profound impacts on various outcome measures. For instance, gesture use by teachers can influence performance on certain academic puzzles by students with ADHD, and teachers' opinions about specific treatment options can impact student behaviour and the types of interventions implemented in the classroom. Teachers who demonstrate patience, knowledge of intervention techniques, an ability to collaborate with an interdisciplinary team, and a positive attitude towards children with special needs can have a positive impact on student success. The ways in which these results relate to clinical practice, particularly considering the influential role of teachers in diagnosis and treatment efficacy, are discussed.

928,Motivational deficits differentially predict improvement in a randomized trial of self-system therapy for depression.,"Eddington, Kari M.; Silvia, Paul J.; Foxworth, Tamara E.; Hoet, Ariana; Kwapil, Thomas R.","OBJECTIVE: A randomized trial compared the time course and differential predictors of symptom improvement in 2 treatments for depression. METHOD: Forty-nine adults (84 \% female) who were not taking antidepressant medications and met diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder or dysthymia were randomly assigned either to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or self-system therapy (SST), a treatment that targets problems in self-regulation, the ongoing process of evaluating progress toward personal goals. Self-regulatory variables (promotion and prevention focus and goal disengagement and reengagement) were assessed as potential moderators of efficacy. At intake, most participants reported depression in the moderate to severe range and had histories of recurrent episodes and previous treatment attempts. Self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed at each therapy session. Multilevel modeling was used to examine (a) differences in change associated with the treatment conditions and (b) moderation of treatment efficacy by pretreatment measures of self-regulatory deficits. RESULTS: Both treatments were effective and did not show differences in the magnitude or rate of symptom change or in dropout rates, suggesting that CBT and SST were equally effective in improving depression and anxiety. Patients with self-regulatory deficits, however, showed greater improvement in depressive symptoms with SST. Specifically, patients with low promotion focus and low goal reengagement responded better to SST, whereas patients with high prevention focus responded better to CBT. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results corroborate previous research suggesting that SST is a viable short-term treatment for depression that is particularly effective in helping patients compensate for self-regulatory deficits.",2015.0,10.1037/a0039058,G2TKL497,0,cognitive,929
929,Cognitive impairment in unipolar depression is persistent and non-specific: further evidence for the final common pathway disorder hypothesis.,"Reppermund, S.; Ising, M.; Lucae, S.; Zihl, J.","BACKGROUND: Cognitive performance is often impaired in depression, and these impairments can persist even after remission from psychopathological symptoms. However, it is still unclear whether cognitive dysfunction is associated with psychopathological symptoms or represents a genuine disorder. This study examined cognitive performance in acute depression, after remission, and 6 months after remission in order to determine the nature and specificity of cognitive dysfunction as well as its relevance for the further course of depression. METHOD: Assessments of cognitive function and psychopathology were carried out on admission and prior to discharge in 53 in-patients with unipolar depression. Twenty patients were retested 6 months after discharge. To correct for practice effects, 13 healthy subjects were included and assessed twice with the same cognitive tests. RESULTS: In acute depression, we found impairments of information processing/attention, memory, and executive functions. Cognitive impairments remained in a high proportion of patients, even after remission of psychopathological symptoms. After correcting for practice effects, a significant improvement was observed only for some tests of executive functioning. Severity of depression was only weakly correlated with one single cognitive measure, indicating that psychopathological and neuropsychological symptoms are dissociable. Furthermore, we found no evidence for specific cognitive dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that cognitive impairments in depression are neither selective nor specific; they have trait-like features and are, therefore, not merely an epiphenomenon of depression. Whether or not cognitive dysfunction is a prognostic marker for the course of depression remains still an open issue.",2009.0,10.1017/S003329170800411X,6CSWJW7N,0,cognitive,930

H.; Olofsen, E.; Dahan, A.; Niesters, M.","BACKGROUND: The commonality between chronic conditions that are treated with low-dose ketamine, such as specific chronic pain conditions, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder, can be found in relation to the stress system, particularly the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. In this study we assess the effect of ketamine on the stress system by measuring plasma and saliva cortisol production during and following exposure to low-dose ketamine. METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, the influence of subanaesthetic ketamine (0.29 mg kg(-1) h(-1) for 1 h, followed by 0.57 mg kg(-1) h(-1) for another hour) was studied with repeated plasma and saliva cortisol samples in 12 healthy male volunteers. A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model was used to describe the circadian rhythm-dependent ketamine-induced production of cortisol. RESULTS: The endogenous mean baseline cortisol production was 7.9 (SE 1.5) nM min(-1). Consistent with the circadian rhythm, cortisol production decayed by 1.25 nM min(-1) h(-1). Ketamine doubled the cortisol production at a concentration of 165 (SE 35) ng ml(-1). The salivary cortisol concentration closely mirrored the plasma concentration and was exponentially related to the plasma concentration with, at 100 ng ml(-1) ketamine, a saliva:plasma ratio of 0.036 (se 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine has an appreciable effect on cortisol production. This may impact on critical physiological and psychological functions.

This article characterizes neuropsychologic functioning during remission in LLD. METHODS: The authors examined longitudinal performance on a comprehensive neuropsychologic battery in 56 nondemented subjects age 60 or older who initially presented with an episode of nonpsychotic unipolar major depression and 40 nondemented, age- and education-equated comparison subjects with no history of depression. Subjects were assessed at baseline (in a depressed state) and one year later (when remitted). RESULTS: After one year, 45 \% of the LLD subjects were cognitively impaired despite remission of depression. Visuospatial ability, information-processing speed, and delayed memory were most frequently impaired; 94 \% of the patients who were impaired at baseline remained impaired one year later. Twenty-three percent of the patients who were cognitively normal while depressed developed impairment one year later. CONCLUSIONS: Most older individuals who are cognitively impaired during a depressive episode remain impaired when their depression remits. In addition, a substantial proportion of older depressed individuals who are cognitively intact when depressed are likely to be impaired one year later, although their depression has remitted.",2006.0,10.1097/01.JGP.0000203130.45421.69,AD6UIXPR,0,cognitive,933
933,Predictors of anxiety and depression 2 years following treatment in uveal melanoma survivors,"Brown, Stephen L.; Hope-Stone, Laura; Heimann, Heinrich; Damato, Bertil; Salmon, Peter","Objective: We examined the role of posttreatment symptoms and functional problems and of worry about recurrent disease (WREC) in predicting probable anxiety and depression cases 24 months after diagnosis in survivors of posterior uveal melanoma. We examined whether WREC mediates links between symptoms, functional problems, and probable anxiety and depression cases. Methods: Prospective cohort study of 261 treated uveal melanoma survivors 6, 12, and 24 months after diagnosis. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses predicting anxiety and depression 24 months after diagnosis identified by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale cutoff scores. Symptoms, functional problems, and WREC 6-month posttreatment were entered into the analyses as predictors, then the same variables at 12 months. We controlled anxiety or depression at 6 and 12 months and chromosome 3 status, which accurately predicts 10-year survival. Mediation of links between 6-month symptoms and functional problems and 24-month anxiety and depression by 12-month WREC was tested. Results: Anxiety caseness at 24 months was predicted by 6-month ocular irritation, headache, and functional problems and 12-month WREC. Depression caseness at 24 months was predicted by 6-month headache and functional problems. Worry about recurrent disease at 12 months mediated prediction of anxiety caseness by 6-month symptoms and functional problems. Chromosome 3 status predicted neither anxiety nor depression. Conclusions: Survivors reporting symptoms, functional problems, and WREC should be monitored for anxiety and depression. Appropriate reassurance that symptoms do not signify future disease might help prevent anxiety.

J.; Walsh-Messinger, J.; Siefert, C. J.; Antonius, D.; Baity, M. R.; Haggerty, G.; Stein, M. B.; Blais, M. A.","Psychologists in medical settings are frequently tasked with providing comprehensive evaluations of patients with complex medical and psychiatric conditions. In order to achieve these aims, standardized measures of neurocognitive and psychological functioning are often employed to empirically assess a patient's level of functioning across an array of relevant clinical domains. However, less is known about the degree to which cognitive impairment affects a patient's ability to complete these more comprehen sive assessments, raising questions about test validity. The current study sought to contribute to this growing body of literature by examining whether neurocognitive functioning is associated with profile validity on the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) in both outpatient (N = 321) and inpatient (N = 131) psychiatric settings. In Study 1, results indicate that while multiple cognitive domains are associated with overall profile validity in psychiatric outpatients, attentional impairment specifically was found to be a significant predictor of profile invalidity after accounting for the effects of overall intellectual functioning (accounting for 13 \ \% \ of the variance overall). The magnitude of attentional impairment specifically, and number of impaired cognitive domains more generally, were also found to be meaningfully associated with overall profile validity. Likewise, in Study 2, PAI profile validity was found to be meaningfully associated with gross cognitive impairment on the WMS-IV Brief Cognitive Status Examination (BCSE) in an inpatient psychiatric setting, with almost half of the patients in the most impaired group yielding invalid PAI profiles.

936,Cyberbullying Among Adolescent Bystanders: Role of Affective Versus Cognitive Empathy in Increasing Prosocial Cyberbystander Behavior,"Barlinska, J.; Szuster, A.; Winiewski, M.","The purpose of this study was to investigate if affective (vicarious sharing of emotions) and cognitive empathy (mental perspective taking) induction may stimulate adolescent online bystanders' intervention in cyberbullying cases. The role of reporting the abuse is crucial because it is a form of active support to the victim, initiated by children, to stop the bullying. The effectiveness of empathy activation in decreasing negative cyberbystander reinforcing behavior has been proved in previous studies. The effects of affective and cognitive empathy activation on positive cyberbystander behavior, defined as reporting the bullying online, were explored in two follow-up studies N = 271 and N = 265. The influence of experiencing cyberbullying as perpetrator, victim, and as determined by gender on prosocial cyberbystander behavior was also controlled. The results indicate that only cognitive empathy activation increases the likelihood of intervening bystander behavior. Neither affective empathy induction, previous experience of cyberperpetration, cybervictimization, nor gender affected the engagement in prosocial bystander behavior. The conclusion of the research is that a program consequently activating more reflective cognitive empathy induction can contribute toward the establishment of healthier behavioral patterns among bystanders to cyberbullying, increasing the probability of their reporting the cyberbullying acts.",2018.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00799,9NPZD4R8,0,additional,937
937,The contribution of attachment security and social support to depressive symptoms in patients with metastic cancer.,"Rodin, Gary; Walsh, Andrew; Zimmermann, Camilla; Gagliese, Lucia; Jones, Jennifer; Shepherd, Frances A.; Moore, Malcolm; Braun, Michal; Donner, Allan; Mikulincer, Mario","The present study examines the association between disease-related factors, perceived social support, attachment security (i.e. attachment anxiety and avoidance), and the occurrence of depressive symptoms in a sample of patients with metastatic gastrointestinal or lung cancer. Results from a sample of 326 cancer outpatients with advanced disease indicate that disease-related factors are significantly associated with the occurrence of depressive symptoms, and the latter are inversely related to the degree of attachment anxiety and avoidance, and perceived social support. Attachment security (on the dimension of anxious attachment) significantly buffered the effect of disease-related factors on depressive symptoms, and perceived social support mediated the relationship between attachment security and depressive symptoms. The buffering effect of attachment security on depressive symptoms and its partial mediation through social support suggest that the interaction of individual, social, and disease-related factors contribute to the emergence of depressive symptoms in patients with metastatic cancer.

William; Grafman, Jordan; http://orcid.org/Moll","The importance of differentiating between social concepts when appraising actions (e.g., understanding behavior as critical vs. fault-finding) and its contribution to vulnerability to major depressive disorder (MDD) is unknown. We predicted poor integration of differentiated conceptual knowledge when people with MDD appraise their social actions, contributing to their tendency to grossly overgeneralize self-blame (e.g., I am unlikable rather than critical ). To test this hypothesis, we used a neuropsychological test measuring social conceptual differentiation and its relationship with emotional biases in a remitted MDD and a control group. During fMRI, guilt- and indignation-evoking sentences were presented. As predicted, conceptual overgeneralization was associated with increased emotional intensity when appraising social actions. Interdependence of conceptual overgeneralization and negative emotional biases was stronger in MDD (reproducible in the subgroup without medication) and was associated with overgeneralized self-blame. This high conceptual-emotional interdependence was associated with functional disconnection between the right superior anterior temporal lobe (ATL) and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) as well as a septal region across groups when experiencing guilt (SPM8). Strong coupling of conceptual information (ATL) with information about the context of actions and emotions (frontal-subcortical regions) is thus associated with appraisal being less dependent on conceptual overgeneralization, thereby protecting against excessive self-blame.

To assess factors associated with visits to GPs, orthopaedists, and non-physician practitioners of complementary medicine (alternative practitioners) by primary care patients with osteoarthritis (OA). Methods. Cross-sectional survey among 1250 consecutively addressed patients from 75 primary care practices in Germany. All patients suffered from OA of the knee or hip according to ACR criteria. They received questionnaires collecting sociodemographic data, data about health service utilisation, prescriptions, comorbidities. They also included established instruments as the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale (AIMS2-SF) to assess disease-specific quality of life and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to assess depression. Hierarchical stepwise multiple linear regression models were used to reveal significant factors influencing health service utilization. Results. 1021 of 1250 (81.6 \% ) questionnaires were returned. Nonrespondents did not differ from participants. Factors associated with health service use (HSU) varied between providers of care. Not being in a partnership, achieving a high score on the PHQ-9, increased pain severity reflected in the symptom scale of the AIMS2-SF, and an increased number of drug prescriptions predicted a high frequency of GP visits. The PHQ-9 score was also a predictor for visits to orthopaedists, as were previous GP contacts, a high score in the symptom scale as well as a high score in the lower limb scale of the AIMS2-SF. Regarding visits to alternative practitioners, a high score in the AIMS - social scale was a positive predictor as older people were less likely to visit them. Conclusion. Our results emphasize the need for awareness of psychological factors contributing to the use of health care providers. Addressing the revealed factors associated with HSU appropriately may lead to decreased health care utilization. But further research is needed to assess how this can be done successfully. \textcopyright 2007 Rosemann et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2007.0,10.1186/1472-6963-7-169,WYM9GHJI,0,cognitive_additional,946

DESIGN: Prospective study with 3-year intervals over a 9-year period. SETTING: Data of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam were used, which is a population-based study among older adults (55-85 years at baseline). PARTICIPANTS: Older adults free of depression and anxiety at baseline (N = 1,712). MEASUREMENTS: Clinically relevant levels of depression and anxiety were measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale \ \textgreater \ or =16 and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale \ \textgreater \ or =7, respectively. A broad range of potential sociodemographic, health, and psychosocial risk factors for anxiety and/or depression were examined by using polytomous logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Within 9 years, 184 subjects (10.8 \ \% \ ) developed DEP, 93 (5.4 \ \% \ ) ANX, and 103 (6.0 \ \% \ ) ANXDEP. Concerning sociodemographics, higher age and lower educational level were predictors for DEP. Health indicators were predictive for DEP and ANXDEP but not for ANX. Depressive symptoms at baseline were predictive for DEP, whereas initial anxiety symptoms were predictive for ANX and ANXDEP. Neuroticism increased the risk of DEP and ANXDEP. Mixed effects of psychosocial variables were found: DEP was associated with recent widowhood, whereas ANX and ANXDEP were associated with other life events such as having an ill partner. CONCLUSION: Although onset of ANXDEP demonstrated communality in risk factors, comparing risk factors associated with DEP and ANX revealed more differences than similarities. This underlines the need to distinguish anxiety from depression in preventive strategies.",2009.0,,5RPD2R36,0,personality,947
947,Main predictions of the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicidal behavior: empirical tests in two samples of young adults.,"Joiner, Thomas E. Jr and","The interpersonal-psychological theory of suicidal behavior (T. E. Joiner, 2005) makes 2 overarching predictions: (a) that perceptions of burdening others and of social alienation combine to instill the desire for death and (b) that individuals will not act on the desire for death unless they have developed the capability to do so. This capability develops through exposure and thus habituation to painful and/or fearsome experiences and is posited by the theory to be necessary for overcoming powerful self-preservation pressures. Two studies tested these predictions. In Study 1, the interaction of (low) family social support (cf. social alienation or low belonging) and feeling that one does not matter (cf. perceived burdensomeness) predicted current suicidal ideation, beyond depression indices. In Study 2, the 3-way interaction among a measure of low belonging, a measure of perceived burdensomeness, and lifetime number of suicide attempts (viewed as a strong predictor of the level of acquired capability for suicide) predicted current suicide attempt (vs. ideation) among a clinical sample of suicidal young adults, again beyond depression indices and other key covariates.

W.; Nathan, R.","Background: There are no published studies that have compared the medical costs of patients with seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis symptomatology. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to develop an algorithm for classifying patients into seasonal and perennial groups based on their patterns of allergy medication use and then compare the epidemiology and economics of the two groups. Methods: Data for the study were obtained from the 1996 to 1998 MarketScan databases containing linked inpatient, outpatient, and pharmaceutical claims for approximately 2 million covered lives annually. Patients were classified into seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) or perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) groups based on their pattern of allergy medication use over the course of 1 year and then compared using descriptive methods. Results: Seventy-nine percent of the total study sample (80,534 allergy patients) was classified as SAR and 21 \% as PAR. PAR patients were found to have higher mean levels of allergy-related outpatient payments ( \$ 568 vs. \$ 471) and higher mean costs for second-generation antihistamines ( \$ 552 vs. \$ 162). PAR patients also had higher levels of comorbidities (asthma, sinusitis, depression, and migraine), higher numbers of concomitant medications (multiple second-generation antihistamines, nasal steroids, other antihistamines, asthma medications, and ophthalmic decongestants), and more immunization encounters. Conclusions: Approximately 21 \% of allergic rhinitis patients have perennial symptoms as reflected in their patterns of medication use. Perennial patients have significantly higher allergy-related health-care costs and rates of comorbidities and greater use of concomitant medications. These distinct clinical and resource use profiles may have implications for therapy choices in the cost-effective management of perennial allergic rhinitis patients.",2003.0,10.1046/j.1524-4733.2003.64231.x,2ZJAY8CT,0,cognitive_additional,951
951,Acute pain management and assessment: Are guidelines being implemented in developing countries (Lebanon),"Zeitoun, A. A.; Dimassi, H. I.; Chami, B. A.; Chamoun, N. R.","Rationale Pain assessment and treatment is influenced by subjective perception of pain. Despite the international efforts to implement guidelines and protocols for pain management, pain continues to be regarded as a complication rather than a primary problem. The literature pertaining to the adequacy of pain management in the Middle East is frail. This study focuses on revealing the implemented practices of initial pain assessment, follow-up and re-evaluation of pain treatment in Lebanese hospitals. Aim and objectives The objective of this study is to evaluate the presence and effectiveness of acute pain management and its impact on the quality of life in hospitals throughout Lebanon, in both cancer and non-cancer populations. Methods A Lebanese multi-centre, prospective, chart review study was conducted over a period of 3 months. Data on demographics, pain medication, dose, route, duration and adjunct pain management were collected. Appropriateness of pain management was determined as per World Health Organization guidelines. Institutional Review Board approvals were obtained from each hospital. Results Results from 582 participants revealed that 50 \% of initial pain assessment intensity scores were based on the assumptions of health care professionals. Furthermore, as pain severity scores increased, the adequacy of pain management decreased. Only 22 \% of the patients had a daily follow-up, and the majority of those continued to receive inappropriate therapy. Conclusion This study reflects the lack of a well-structured system for pain management in Lebanese hospitals. It underlines the need for pain research in the region. It also highlights the need for implementing the recommendations discussed to minimize risk and optimize pain management. \textcopyright 2012 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.",2013.0,10.1111/j.1365-2753.2012.01860.x,RIU223M8,0,cognitive_additional,952

J.","Background Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) relieve irritability within days in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD); however, the effects on other affective symptoms in PMDD remain to be demonstrated. Methods We performed hourly ratings in women with PMDD to test the specificity of the therapeutic effects of SRIs and to determine whether the kinetics of these effects differ from those of the symptom offset accompanying menses. Twelve women with PMDD received fluoxetine (20 mg daily) during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Twelve other women with PMDD received no treatment. Outcome measures included a visual analogue scale completed hourly before and after either the start of SRIs or at menses-onset in the untreated women and the premenstrual tension syndrome (PMTS) scale completed daily. Data were analyzed by ANOVA-R. Results Hourly VAS scores significantly improved after SRI in irritability as well as sadness, anxiety, and mood swings. Compared with the symptomatic pretreatment baseline, PMTS scores significantly improved on the second day after the start of SRI (p \textless .01). An identical time course of symptom improvement occurred after both SRI and menses-onset. Conclusion and Discussion These data document that the rapid response to SRI was not limited to irritability. The similar kinetics in the remission of PMDD after SRIs and after menses-onset suggest both a phenotype reflecting the relative capacity to rapidly change affective state, and a possible therapeutic mechanism by which SRIs recruit this endogenous capacity to change state, normally expressed around menses-onset in women with PMDD. \textcopyright 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2012.0,10.1002/da.21959,PYU2HN9T,0,cognitive_additional,953

One such way pertains to their perceived maternal competence. The present study examined the effects of depression and intimate partner violence on maternal self-efficacy among Mexican women living in Mexico and the United States of America. A total of 136 women (91 Mexican immigrant women living in the United States of America and 45 Mexican women living in Mexico) completed three questionnaires. Results showed that mothers in Mexico reported higher levels of depression, as well as increased incidence of physical and psychological violence. Furthermore, in a multiple regression analysis, educational level and depression were significant predictors of maternal self-efficacy. A mediating effect of depression on the relationship between physical violence and maternal self-efficacy was also found. Overall, Mexican immigrant women living in the United States of America appeared to have higher levels of maternal self-efficacy in comparison to mothers living in Mexico.

954,Suicide risk factors and suicide vulnerability in various major psychiatric disorders.,"Modai, Ilan; Kuperman, Julia; Goldberg, Imri; Goldish, Michael; Mendel, Shalom","PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: There are many known suicide risk factors (SRF) common to major psychiatric disorders, but their impact on suicide vulnerability remains unclear. We used FALCON (Fuzzy Adaptive Learning Control Network) to evaluate those impacts. METHODS: Staff psychiatrists completed computerized suicide risk scales (CSRS-III) including 21 SRF for 612 patients. Diagnoses were: schizophrenia, schizoaffective, major depression, anxiety disorder, bipolar affective disorder, personality disorder, organic brain syndromes, delusional disorder and other diagnoses. An optimal trained FALCON was obtained by running the network 10 times with 552 CSRS-III, validating with the balance. Medically serious suicide attempts (the vulnerability factor) served as the target variable. The significance of each variable in the trained network was determined by the magnitude of the change in output as affected by the consecutive change in all points of the variable input, then calculating the mean variance of all cases. The direction of influence was determined by the input on the entire scale of each variable, point by point, across all cases, then calculating the mean of all outputs. RESULTS: The impact and direction of influence of the various SRF differed for each diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Evaluation of the individual patient with his/her specific impact profile, determination of direction of influence of the corresponding SRF's may assist in increasing the accuracy of individual suicide risk assessment.",2004.0,10.1080/14639230410001662651,QDVP9YUG,0,personality,955

To date there is no empirically supported psychological treatment targeting cancer-related psychological distress in this population. The aim of the current study was to test the feasibility and preliminarily evaluate the effect of individualized face-to-face cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for parents of children after the end of treatment for childhood cancer. A secondary aim was to present a cognitive behavioral conceptualization of cancer-related distress for these parents. Methods: An open trial was conducted where 15 parents of children who had completed successful treatment for cancer three months to five years earlier and who reported psychological distress related to a child's previous cancer disease were provided CBT at a maximum of 15 sessions. Participants were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and three-month follow-up using self-reported psychological distress (including posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), depression, and anxiety) and the diagnostic Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Feasibility outcomes relating to recruitment, data collection, and delivery of the treatment were also examined. Individual case formulations for each participant guided the intervention and these were aggregated and presented in a conceptualization detailing core symptoms and their suggested maintenance mechanisms. Results: A total of 93% of the participants completed the treatment and all of them completed the follow-up assessment. From baseline to post-assessment, parents reported significant improvements in PTSS, depression, and anxiety with medium to large effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.65-0.92). Results were maintained or improved at a three-month follow-up. At baseline, seven (47%) participants fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder and four (29%) fulfilled the criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder, compared to none at a post-assessment and a follow-up assessment. The resulting cognitive behavioral conceptualization suggests traumatic stress and depression as the core features of distress, and avoidance and inactivity is suggested as the core maintenance mechanisms. Conclusion: The treatment was feasible and acceptable to the participants. Significant improvements in distress were observed during the study. Overall, results suggest that the psychological treatment for parents of children after end of treatment for childhood cancer used in the current study is promising and should be tested and evaluated in future studies.",2018.0,10.7717/peerj.4570,4JRTV55K,0,additional,956

As I feel the commentator has given a somewhat distorted picture of my position, I have to start by making some corrections: I do not claim, as you seem to think, that psychoanalysis leaves the so-called developmental failures untreated. The aim of my paper is not to discuss traditional psychoanalysis. My purpose is to raise a fundamental question: How can we come to grips with the isolated experiential states in those patients where affective arousal is not linked to some kind of symbolic representation in the first place? I do not place the search for unconscious meaning in opposition to the patient's need for experiencing a quality of being. My focus is to distinguish between different layers and modes of psychic functioning. In fact, this is the essence of the paper.

Aim: The aims of this article were (i) to replicate the findings of earlier research identifying two subtypes of women with persistent arousal--those who meet all features of the condition and are at least moderately distressed, and those who meet only some features and are less distressed; and (ii) to identify the medical, psychological and/or pharmacological correlates of the condition. Method: A comprehensive web-based survey of persistent genital arousal (PGA) was posted on several Internet websites. Of the 156 women who completed the survey, 76 met all five features qualifying for a persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD) group, and 48 met only some features (non-PGAD group). Main Outcome Measures: The main outcome measures were endorsement of diagnostic signs of depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and panic attack as well as medical illnesses and pharmacological preparations. Results: Compared to non-PGA subjects, women with PGA were significantly more likely to be depressed (55 \% vs. 38 \% ) and to report panic attacks (31.6 \% vs. 14.6 \% ). They were more anxious and more likely to monitor their physical sensations. Both groups reported high rates of childhood and adult sexual abuse, although the PGA women reported a higher prevalence of sexual victimization. They were significantly more likely to endorse negative feelings about their genital sensations and also more likely to complain of chronic fatigue syndrome than women without the condition (10 \% vs. 0 \% ). There were no significant relationships with pharmacologic agents and symptoms. Conclusions: Women who met all the criteria of PGAD were more likely than women who only met some of the criteria to report depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and certain obsessive-compulsive symptoms such as monitoring their physical sensations. It is hypothesized that for a subset of women, psychological factors, namely anxiety, reinforce exacerbate and maintain PGAD.

Depression, as a treatable condition, may be important in the development of dementia. Our objective was to examine the association between depressive symptoms and longitudinal cognitive changes in older adults who were high-functioning at baseline. METHODS: The authors analyzed data from a community-based cohort (aged 70-79 at baseline), who, at study entry, scored 7 or more (out of 9) on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ). Depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline using the depression subscale of the Hopkins Symptom Check List. Cognitive performance was measured at baseline and at seven-year follow up by the SPMSQ and by summary scores from standard tests of naming, construction, spatial recognition, abstraction, and delayed recall. RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounders, including age, education, and chronic health conditions such as diabetes, heart attack, stroke, and hypertension, a higher number of baseline depressive symptoms were strongly associated with greater seven-year decline in cognitive performance and with higher odds of incident cognitive impairment, i.e., decline in SPMSQ score to \textless or = 6 (adjusted odds ratio per quartile of depressive symptoms score: 1.34, 95 \% confidence interval: 1.10-1.68).

Together, these formations give the mind a heart, which may come under attack from an omniscient, Tiresias-like internal object.

Three successful cases of eight-session psychodynamic-interpersonal (PI) therapy were selected on the basis of Beck Depression Inventory scores. One unsuccessful case was also selected against which identified patterns could be tested. The successful clients were more descriptive about their problems and demonstrated active rapport building, and the therapist used positionings expressed by the client to explore the positionings developed between them during therapy. The unsuccessful case was characterized by a lack of positive self-comment, minimization of agentic self-capacity, and empathy-disrupting narrative confusions. The authors conclude that the theory of interactional positioning is useful in identifying patterns worth exploring as early indicators of success in PI therapy. \textcopyright 2005 Society for Psychotherapy Research.",2005.0,,P859M7C9,0,psychodynamic,962
962,Improving Emotion Regulation at the End of Breast Cancer Treatment,Nct,"1. Introduction At the end of treatment, breast cancer patients are confronted with the short‐ and long‐term physical (e.g., fatigue, pain, hot flashes) and psychological (e.g., anxiety, fear of recurrence, depressive symptoms) consequences of cancer diagnosis and treatment (Costanzo et al., 2007 ; Stanton et al., 2005). Emotion dysregulation (e.g., anxiety, fear of recurrence (Devine & Westlake,1995), depressive symptoms (Stanton, 2006)) is, with fatigue (Jacobsen & Jim, 2008) and cognitive dysfunctions (Duijts et al., 2011), one of the three most common complaints. Nevertheless, few psychological interventions have focused on this period (Jacobsen & Jim, 2008 ; Stanton et al., 2005 ; Stanton, 2006) and no intervention has specifically addressed emotion regulation of breast cancer survivors (Devine & Westlake, 1995 ; Duijts et al., 2011 ; Sheard & Maguire, 1999). Little is known about the required components of psychological interventions designed to support patients facing these challenges. Meta‐analyses (Naaman et al., 2009 ; Osborn, 2006 ; Sheard & Maguire, 1999) and one review (Traeger et al., 2012) have described various components of interventions used to address anxiety and depressive symptoms in cancer care, such as mindfulness (Lengacher et al., 2009 ; Würtzen et al., 2013), education (Björneklett et al., 2012 ; Dolbeault et al., 2009 ; Duijts et al., 2011 ; Fors et al., 2011 ; Osborn, 2006 ; Scheier et al., 2005), cognitive‐behavioral therapy (Dolbeault et al., 2009 ; Duijts et al., 2012 ; Fors et al., 2011 ; Osborn, 2006 ; Savard et al., 2005 ; Savard et al., 2005), support groups (Björneklett et al., 2012 ; Fors et al., 2011 ; Montazeri et al., 2001), and relaxation training (Björneklett et al., 2012 ; Elsesser, Van Berkel & Sartory, 1994 ; Hidderley & Holt, 2004). These interventions taken individually presented moderate effect sizes (Naaman et al., 2009), suggesting the need to combine components. During the last four years, our team conducted a study designed to compare the benefits in terms of emotion regulation of a 15‐session single‐component group intervention (SGI) based only on support with those of a 15‐session multi‐component group intervention (MGI) combining support with cognitive‐behavioral and hypnosis components. The cognitive‐behavioral therapy (CBT) components were chosen because interventions using such components have shown larger effect sizes than interventions using other components in previous studies on the treatment of anxiety‐related conditions (Chambless & Ollendick, 2001 ; Deacon & Abramowitz, 2004 ; Norton & Price, 2007 ; Osborn, 2006 ; Stewart & Chambless, 2009). The hypnosis component was chosen because some reviews have suggested that self‐hypnosis training is a rapid, cost‐effective, and safe alternative to medication for the treatment of such conditions. Moreover, a meta‐analysis showed that the addition of hypnosis to cognitive‐behavioral component enhances effect sizes of interventions (Kirsch, Montgomery & Sapirstein, 1995) . Results of this study have shown the acceptability of such an intervention after active treatment (Merckaert et al., 2015). They have also indicated that an MGI combining support with CBT and hypnosis is clinically useful for patients with breast cancer after radiotherapy. Our results confirm the need to design specific interventions targeting anxiety regulation, fear of recurrence, and depressive symptoms. They also underline the necessity of intensifying interventions through including other components (e.g., emotion regulation, repetitive exposures to fear, treatment of intrusive thoughts, attention reorientation). 2. Objectives of the study The primary aims of this study are to evaluate in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) the efficacy of an 8‐session multi‐component group intervention extended over 4 months in promoting emotion regulation (in an emotion regulation task and in everyday life) and patient emotional well‐being compared with a waiting‐list control group. The secondary aims are to eva ate patients' satisfaction with the program, hypnosis/relaxation practice in everyday life, mental adjustment, and changes in patients' level of attentional bias toward cancer threat and physical activity. 3. Participants Patients who have been treated for a non‐metastatic breast cancer will be approached at the end of active cancer treatment (i.e., surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy) in order to be screened for emotion dysregulation. Patients experiencing moderate to high emotion dysregulation (one to four scores = or > 4 on a 11‐point Likert adapted Edmonton symptoms evaluation scale assessing anxiety, fear of recurrence, depression, and intrusive thoughts) will be offered the intervention. 4. Intervention 4.1. Theoretical framework This is a multi‐component group intervention integrating an emotion regulation and an exposure to fear component. 4.1.1. The emotion regulation component builds upon the Adaptive Coping with Emotions Model which was developed to provide a conceptualization of adaptive emotion regulation. It aims to help patients to better identify their physical, emotional and behavioral responses to their positive and negative emotions in order to be able to better regulate or acknowledge those emotions. This component integrates a self‐regulation component. The self‐regulation component relies on a phone app‐based coaching intervention aiming at promoting changes in patients' ability to regulate their emotions in their everyday life. It aims at promoting patients' self‐awareness of their internal states, orientating their attention consciously toward positive stimuli and at developing physical activity. Hypnosis is used as hetero‐hypnosis in each session and aims at deepening the development of patients' emotion regulation skills. Recordings of the exercises done in session are transmitted to the patients in order to promote use of the technique at home. Helping patients develop autohypnosis skills is important as it may allow them to better regulate their emotions in everyday life. 4.1.2. The exposure to fear component aims at helping patients deal with their fear of death. Just as anxiety is a normal emotion, anxiety concerning death is also a normal experience. The modest level of death anxiety that most people experience in everyday life may increase dramatically when one experiences a period of health problems, illness, or death of someone close (Kastenbaum, 2000). This part of the intervention will be based on worry exposure. This part of the intervention targets cancer‐related worry and is based on Borkovec's avoidance theory of worry (Borkovec et al., 1998). Worry is a predominantly cognitive‐verbal activity that inhibits full emotional processing. As a result, disturbing emotional meanings of potentially dangerous and anxiously anticipated events cannot be fully tested or altered, making the repetitive processing of the feared stimuli probable (Foa & Kozak, 1986). Given that cancer‐recurrence related‐worry is typically characterized by the focus on one hypothetical future event, it follows that exposure with imagined stimuli could be a crucial component of the treatment of fear of recurrence. The intervention will be based on two exercises. In the first, patients will be accompanied through a hypnosis based exposure to a major trigger of fear of recurrence that is the anticipation of the cancer check‐up. This exercise is designed to help patients experience the emotions which may arise in this context while being guided through their resolution and regulation. The second exercise aims at helping them overcome their fear of recurrence through discussing their worst‐case scenario in the group. The scenario are then discussed in order to highlight which part of them could be modified because it is unrealistic or because patients have more resources than they anticipate. 4.2. Study design and assessment schedule This is a two‐armed, randomized, waiting‐list controlled trial. Patients who agree to participate will be randomly assigned to two groups: 1) the experim tal group (EG) where six patients will receive one individual pre‐group session and 8 sessions of group intervention combining cognitive‐behavioral therapy and hypnosis; and 2) the waiting‐list control group (CG) where six patients will receive the same intervention 4 months later. Patients will be assessed at three time points: 1) at baseline (T1), 2) 4 months later (T2), that means just after the intervention for the experimental group (EG) and just before the intervention for the control group (CG), and 3) 4 months later (T3), that means 4 months after the T2 for the experimental group and just after the intervention for the control group (CG). 4.2.1. Pre‐assessment screening Before inclusion in the study, during the last weeks of treatment (T0), approached patients will complete a socio‐demographic questionnaire, a screening of life habits and difficulties questionnaire, an adapted Edmonton symptom evaluation scale (Chang, Hwang & Feuerman, 2000) (assessing pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, memory loss, feeling of malaise, hot flashes, depression, anxiety, fear of recurrence, and worry), the Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) (Zigmond & Snaith, 1983), and the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory Severity sub‐scale (Simard & Savard, 2009). Patients will report medical information about their disease, previous and current treatment and prognosis. This screening allows checking for inclusion and exclusion criteria and comparing patients who accept and refuse the intervention. 4.2.2. Assessment procedure Each assessment procedure (i.e., T1, T2, T3) includes three parts: an emotion regulation task, an ecological momentary assessment and an attentional bias task. Two months after T1 and T2, the experimental (EG) and control (CG) groups will be contacted once by phone to complete a phone‐based questionnaire to assess their usual care use. 4.2.2.1. Emotion regulation task This assessment procedure has been used in a previous project and provides a dynamic picture of patients' emotion regulation. Each assessment session will first involve completion of questionnaires and two emotion regulation exercises: (1) 4 min exposure to anxiety triggers through completion of the Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale (Watson et al., 1988), followed by a 12‐min self‐relaxation exercise in which patients will be asked to relax by using their own strategies; and (2) 4 min exposure to anxiety triggers through completion of the Impact of Cancer Questionnaire (Zebrack et al., 2006), followed by a 12‐min guided hypnosis exercise in which patients will be asked to listen to an audio recording of a hypnotic induction script. The subtasks will be separated by a period of questionnaires completion. Patients' emotion regulation will be measured physiologically (heart rate measurement) and psychologically (anxiety, sadness, fear of recurrence and energy state‐levels). 4.2.2.2. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) Patients' emotion regulation in their everyday life will be assessed during 9 days through an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) procedure. Firstly, patients will be asked 5 times a day to select on a list of 20 emotions the 2 or 3 that they were experiencing during the minutes before they saw the notification. For each emotion experienced, they will have to report its intensity on a 10‐point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 10. They will have to report to what extent they have felt able to control those emotions and have felt submerged by those emotions. They will report whether during those minutes they had been thinking about something other than what they were currently doing. They will have to answer with one of four options: no; yes, something pleasant; yes, something neutral; or yes, something unpleasant (Killingsworth & Gilbert, 2010). Finally, they will be asked their level of fatigue and energy. Prompts will be sent randomly from 9 AM to 7,5 PM through the use of the software from http://www.lifedatacorp.com/. Secondly, each evening for 9 consecutive days, patients ill have to indicate on the same list of 20 emotions (10 positive and 10 negative emotions), the extent to which they have felt each of the 20 emotions in the past 24 hours and their level of fatigue, from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) (Fredrickson et al., 2003). In order to insure confidentiality, subjects will be provided with an iPod Touch. The two first days of data collection will be used as a training for participants and only their responses on the 7 following days will be taken into consideration. Thirdly, patients will be provided with an armband to continuously record during those 9 days, their heart rate levels, physical activity levels (pedometer and accelerometer) and sleep patterns (Garmin vívoactive HR). 4.2.2.3. Attentional bias task Patients will complete an attentional bias computer task assessing attentional orientation toward emotional information. An adaptive function of biased attentional orientation toward negative information is to facilitate detection of danger in the environment and to help the organism respond effectively to threatening situations (Bar‐Haim et al., 2007). When anxiety symptoms become excessive, biased attentional orientation toward negative information may have detrimental effects on patients' cognitive (e.g., intrusive thoughts, misinterpretation), behavioral (e.g., body screening, future planning difficulties), emotional (e.g., negative affects, panic attacks), and physiological status (e.g., physiological stress activation), and may play a prominent role in the etiology and maintenance of anxiety disorders (Bar‐Haim et al., 2007). Computer tasks have been used to study the threat‐related attentional bias in anxiety.",2017.0,,5QKVI9AE,0,additional,963
963,"Psychological Processes Mediate the Impact of Familial Risk, Social Circumstances and Life Events on Mental Health","Kinderman, P.; Schwannauer, M.; Pontin, E.; Tai, S.","Background:Despite widespread acceptance of the 'biopsychosocial model', the aetiology of mental health problems has provoked debate amongst researchers and practitioners for decades. The role of psychological factors in the development of mental health problems remains particularly contentious, and to date there has not been a large enough dataset to conduct the necessary multivariate analysis of whether psychological factors influence, or are influenced by, mental health. This study reports on the first empirical, multivariate, test of the relationships between the key elements of the biospychosocial model of mental ill-health.Methods and Findings:Participants were 32,827 (age 18-85 years) self-selected respondents from the general population who completed an open-access online battery of questionnaires hosted by the BBC. An initial confirmatory factor analysis was performed to assess the adequacy of the proposed factor structure and the relationships between latent and measured variables. The predictive path model was then tested whereby the latent variables of psychological processes were positioned as mediating between the causal latent variables (biological, social and circumstantial) and the outcome latent variables of mental health problems and well-being. This revealed an excellent fit to the data, S-B $\chi$2 (3199, N = 23,397) = 126654 \textperiodcentered 8, p \textless \textperiodcentered 001; RCFI = \textperiodcentered 97; RMSEA = \textperiodcentered 04 ( \textperiodcentered 038- \textperiodcentered 039). As hypothesised, a family history of mental health difficulties, social deprivation, and traumatic or abusive life-experiences all strongly predicted higher levels of anxiety and depression. However, these relationships were strongly mediated by psychological processes; specifically lack of adaptive coping, rumination and self-blame.Conclusion:These results support a significant revision of the biopsychosocial model, as psychological processes determine the causal impact of biological, social, and circumstantial risk factors on mental health. This has clear implications for policy, education and clinical practice as psychological processes such as rumination and self-blame are amenable to evidence-based psychological therapies. \textcopyright 2013 Kinderman et al.",2013.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0076564,QBJ65Q2C,0,diathesis,964
964,Social problem solving in adolescents with suicidal behavior: A systematic review,"Speckens, A. E. M.; Hawton, K.","There is an increasing focus on deficiencies in problem solving as a vulnerability factor for suicidal behavior in general and hence a target for treatment in suicide attempters. In view of the uncertainty of evidence for this in adolescents we conducted a systematic review of the international research literature examining the possible relationship between deficiencies in social problem-solving skills and suicidal behavior in this population. This was based on searching two electronic databases: Medline 1966 to September 2003 and PsychInfo 1887 to September 2003. Twenty-two studies of social problem-solving skills in adolescents with suicidal behavior were found. Most of these studies, which compared adolescent patients with suicide attempts versus either nonsuicidal psychiatric or normal controls, found evidence for problem-solving deficits in the attempters; however, few of the differences remain after controlling for depression and/or hopelessness. Because most of the studies are cross-sectional, it is difficult to differentiate between the possibilities that deficiencies in problem-solving skills lead to depression when adolescents are faced by adversity and hence to suicidal behavior, or whether depression is the main factor which undermines problem-solving skills. Future research, preferably with longitudinal research designs, is required to determine the nature of the association between problem-solving skills and suicidal behavior in adolescents. This has important implications for therapeutic interventions. \textcopyright 2005 The American Association of Suicidology.",2005.0,,KIV8WSKK,0,behavior,965
965,Parental verbal abuse and the mediating role of self-criticism in adult internalizing disorders.,"Sachs-Ericsson, Natalie; Verona, Edelyn; Joiner, Thomas; Preacher, Kristopher J.","BACKGROUND: Researchers (e.g., [Gibb, B.E., 2002. Childhood maltreatment and negative cognitive styles. A quantitative and qualitative review. Clinical Psychology Review, 22 (2), 223-246]; [Rose, D.T., Abramson, L.Y., 1992. Developmental predictors of depressive cognitive styles: developmental perspectives on depression. In Cicchetti, D., Toth, S.L. (Eds.), Developmental Perspectives on Depression. Rochester symposium on developmental psychopathology, vol. 4, pp. 323-349]) have proposed that when childhood abuse is verbal (rather than sexual or physical), the child is more likely to develop a negative self-schema because the negative self-cognitions are directly supplied to the child by the abuser (e.g., you are stupid ). METHODS: In a test of this theory in adult participants, and drawing on the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) (N=5877), we investigate the mediating role of current levels of self-criticism on the relationship between retrospective reports of parental verbal abuse, as well as sexual and physical abuse, and adult internalizing symptoms. RESULTS: We found self-criticism, but not dependency traits, to fully mediate the relationship between childhood verbal abuse perpetrated by parents and internalizing (depression, anxiety) symptoms. On the other hand, self-criticism was only a partial mediator of the relationship between the other types of abuse and internalizing symptoms. LIMITATIONS: The NCS data is cross-sectional, which limits any firm conclusions regarding causality. While these results are suggestive that self-criticism is a mediator of the relationship between abuse and internalizing symptoms, longitudinal data are necessary to help rule out alternative explanations. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study suggest that childhood abuse experiences, and in particular verbal abuse, may confer risk for internalizing disorders in part because verbal abuse influences the development of a self-critical style.",2006.0,10.1016/j.jad.2006.02.014,BETZHJHS,0,cognitive,966
966,Occupational therapy interventions for chronic diseases: A scoping review.,"Hand, Carri; Law, Mary; McColl, Mary Ann","Objective: We reviewed the evidence regarding the effectiveness of community occupational therapy interventions, delivered alone or within a multidisciplinary team, in improving occupational outcomes for adults with selected chronic diseases. Method: We completed a scoping review of randomized controlled trials published from 1988 through 2008. Studies included participants with heart disease, depression, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, or diabetes. Results: Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Ten studies found significant differences between intervention and control groups for at least one outcome of function in activities of daily living, functional self-efficacy, social or work function, psychological health, general health, or quality of life. Conflicting evidence exists regarding the impact of intervention on physical function and health. Conclusion: Occupational therapy can improve occupational outcomes in adults with chronic diseases. Using and building on this evidence, occupational therapists can continue to promote their role in helping to meet this population's needs.

968,Assessment and treatment of depression in coronary artery disease patients,"Kop, W. J.; Ader, D. N.","Depressive symptoms occur frequently among patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), with prevalence estimates ranging from 15 to 30 \% . Risk ratios for first and recurrent cardiac events related to depression are comparable to well-established CAD risk factors and range from 2 to 7. The commonly atypical nature of depression in individuals with CAD plays an important role in the under diagnosis of depression in these patients. This review indicates that presence of atypical and subclinical depression, as well as of clinical major depressive disorders, significantly increase the risk of cardiac events. Pathophysiological mechanisms include altered autonomic nervous system activity, increased tendency toward blood coagulation, and elevated low-grade inflammation. Evidence suggests that depression in CAD patients does not reflect anatomical CAD severity or use of anti-ischemic medications. In addition to these pathophysiological pathways, depression affects CAD progression via adverse health behaviors such as smoking, poor compliance, and reduced exercise levels. Initial screening for depressive disorders can be accomplished using questionnaires, but structured clinical interviews are preferred for definite diagnosis of depression. Optimal treatment of depression in CAD generally involves both psychological and pharmacological interventions that affect both depression and its biological correlates relevant to CAD progression.",2001.0,,ER9PXKFP,0,cognitive_additional,969

H.; Cohen, Zachary D.; Lemmens, Lotte H. J. M.; Arntz, Arnoud; Peeters, Frenk P. M. L.; Cuijpers, Pim; DeRubeis, Robert J.","INTRODUCTION: Although psychotherapies for depression produce equivalent outcomes, individual patients respond differently to different therapies. Predictors of outcome have been identified in the context of randomized trials, but this information has not been used to predict which treatment works best for the depressed individual. In this paper, we aim to replicate a recently developed treatment selection method, using data from an RCT comparing the effects of cognitive therapy (CT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: 134 depressed patients completed the pre- and post-treatment BDI-II assessment. First, we identified baseline predictors and moderators. Second, individual treatment recommendations were generated by combining the identified predictors and moderators in an algorithm that produces the Personalized Advantage Index (PAI), a measure of the predicted advantage in one therapy compared to the other, using standard regression analyses and the leave-one-out cross-validation approach.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We found five predictors (gender, employment status, anxiety, personality disorder and quality of life) and six moderators (somatic complaints, cognitive problems, paranoid symptoms, interpersonal self-sacrificing, attributional style and number of life events) of treatment outcome. The mean average PAI value was 8.9 BDI points, and 63 \% of the sample was predicted to have a clinically meaningful advantage in one of the therapies. Those who were randomized to their predicted optimal treatment (either CT or IPT) had an observed mean end-BDI of 11.8, while those who received their predicted non-optimal treatment had an end-BDI of 17.8 (effect size for the difference = 0.51).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: Depressed patients who were randomized to their predicted optimal treatment fared much better than those randomized to their predicted non-optimal treatment. The PAI provides a great opportunity for formal decision-making to improve individual patient outcomes in depression. Although the utility of the PAI approach will need to be evaluated in prospective research, this study promotes the development of a treatment selection approach that can be used in regular mental health care, advancing the goals of personalized medicine.",2015.0,,WLP3R4VE,0,cognitive,970

V.; Reiss, D.","Objective: Little is known about how parenting might offset genetic risk to prevent the onset of child problems during toddlerhood. We used a prospective adoption design to separate genetic and environmental influences and test whether associations between structured parenting and toddler behavior problems were conditioned by genetic risk for psychopathology. Method: The sample included 290 linked sets of adoptive families and birth mothers and 95 linked birth fathers. Genetic risk was assessed via birth mother and birth father psychopathology (anxiety, depression, antisociality, and drug use). Structured parenting was assessed via microsocial coding of adoptive mothers' behavior during a cleanup task. Toddler behavior problems were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist. Results: Controlling for tempera mental risk at 9 months, there was an interaction between birth mother psychopathology and adoptive mothers' par enting on toddler behavior problems at 18 months. The interaction indicated two pathways to child problems: structured parenting was beneficial for toddlers at high genetic risk but was related to behavior problems for toddlers at low genetic risk. This crossover interaction pattern was replicated with birth father psychopathology as the index of genetic risk. Conclusions: The effects of structured parenting on toddler behavior problems varied as a function of genetic risk. Children at genetic risk might benefit from parenting interventions during toddlerhood that enhance structured par enting. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc.

A.; Eisemann, M.; Figenschau, Y.; Halvorsen, M.","The association between depressive symptoms and elevated cortisol levels, and depression and cognitive functioning, has been less robust in outpatients with symptoms in the mild to moderate range. Furthermore, the association between elevated cortisol levels and cognitive functioning is unclear. In the present study, currently depressed (n = 37), previously depressed (n = 81) and never depressed controls (n = 50) were assessed on a range of neuropsychological measures. Salivary cortisol was measured in the morning and evening. Participants with current depression were non-hospitalized and had symptoms predominately in the mild to moderate range. Elevated salivary evening cortisol, but not morning cortisol, was significantly related to depressive symptoms. The difference in cortisol levels between the previously depressed group and the never depressed controls was not significant. The groups had significantly different cognitive profiles, with the currently depressed performing poorer on tasks related to working memory compared to the never depressed controls. Both the currently and previously depressed performed worse on attentional tasks. The findings indicate that outpatients with mild to moderate depression have elevated cortisol levels and limited mild cognitive impairments. Furthermore, mild impairments in attention may persist after remission, indicating that this could be a trait-marker in depression.

972,Critical and unresolved issues of borderline personality.,"Stone, Michael H.","Contends that the central unresolved issue concerning borderline personality is the diagnostic confusion engendered by a multiplicity of definitions stemming from a multiplicity of approaches. In addition, there are confusing interrelationships of borderline and affective conditions and a need for better biologic markers to assist in the disentanglement of these concepts. Alcoholism as an atypical manifestation (like certain borderline states) of manic-depressive predisposition or a genetically distinct tendency must be explored with psychogenetic studies. Within the psychoanalytic community, there is a need to evaluate more methodically psychodynamic factors in the causation of borderline conditions. In a small number of cases, parents who are emotionally warm, empathic, and generally competent in their families have offspring with borderline conditions. It is suggested that there is a continuum with purely psychogenic cases at one end and, at the other, cases in which biologic factors account for most of the variance. Controlled studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of expressive vs supportive therapy and the role of intensive therapy in a long-term inpatient setting for Ss with borderline personality.

M.","BACKGROUND: The present open study investigates the feasibility of Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) in groups solely composed of bipolar patients of various subtypes. MBCT has been mostly evaluated with remitted unipolar depressed patients and little is known about this treatment in bipolar disorder. METHODS: Bipolar outpatients (type I, II and NOS) were included and evaluated for depressive and hypomanic symptoms, as well as mindfulness skills before and after MBCT. Patients' expectations before the program, perceived benefit after completion and frequency of mindfulness practice were also recorded. RESULTS: Of 23 included patients, 15 attended at least four MBCT sessions. Most participants reported having durably, moderately to very much benefited from the program, although mindfulness practice decreased over time. Whereas no significant increase of mindfulness skills was detected during the trial, change of mindfulness skills was significantly associated with change of depressive symptoms between pre- and post-MBCT assessments. CONCLUSIONS: MBCT is feasible and well perceived among bipolar patients. Larger and randomized controlled studies are required to further evaluate its efficacy, in particular regarding depressive and (hypo)manic relapse prevention. The mediating role of mindfulness on clinical outcome needs further examination and efforts should be provided to enhance the persistence of meditation practice with time.",2010.0,10.1016/j.eurpsy.2010.03.007,6JH5EBHW,0,cognitive,975

Female Parkinson's disease (PD) patients seem to experience not only more severe motor complications and postural instability but also more pronounced depression, anxiety, pain, and sleep disturbances. Objective. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of sex as a possible independent predictor of HRQoL in PD. Methods. In this cross-sectional study, 621 consecutive patients treated at the University of Pecs were enrolled. Severity of PD symptoms was assessed by MDS-UPDRS, UDysRS, Non-Motor Symptoms Scale, PDSS-2, Hamilton Anxiety Scale, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Lille Apathy Rating Scale, and Addenbrooke Cognitive Examination. HRQoL was assessed by PDQ-39 and EQ-5D. Multiple regression analysis was performed to estimate the PDQ-39 and EQ-5D index values based on various clinical factors. Results. Although females received significantly lower dosage of levodopa, they had significantly more disabling dyskinesia and worse postural instability. Anxiety, pain, sleep disturbances, and orthostatic symptoms were more frequent among females while sexual dysfunction, apathy, and daytime sleepiness were more severe among males. Women had worse HRQoL than men (EQ-5D index value: 0.620 +/- 0.240 versus 0.663 +/- 0.229, p = 0.025, and PDQ-39 SI: 27.1 +/- 17.0 versus 23.5 +/- 15.9, p = 0.010).

Results were assessed after 8 weeks of acute treatment and during maintenance treatment up to 1 year. RESULTS: No difference was found for acute efficacy between the two drugs. Mania/hypomania was observed in 5 of 10 desipramine-treated patients, but only 1 of 9 bupropion-treated patients. The occurrence of hypomania or mania was correlated with treatment group (Kendall's tau correlation = 0.42; Z = -2.5, p \textless .012).

Both of these were mostly influenced by environmental liability factors (heritability, 29.3 \ \% \ and 2.2 \ \% \ ). With 1 exception (criterion 2, unstable and intense relationships), the specific criteria were strongly influenced by environmental factors. Five of the 9 criterion-specific genetic effects were either 0 or negligible. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results indicate that most of the genetic effects on the individual BPD criteria derive from 1 highly heritable general BPD factor, whereas the environmental influences were mostly criterion specific.",2013.0,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.1944,CEERF62I,0,personality,984
984,An outcome of psychodynamic psychotherapy: A case study of the change in serotonin transporter binding and the activation of the dream screen,"Saarinen, P. I.; Lehtonen, J.; Joensuu, M.; Tolmunen, T.; Ahola, P.; Vanninen, R.; Kuikka, J.; Tiihonen, J.",We explored the outcome of psychodynamic psychotherapy of a female patient with major depression using clinical evaluation and serotonin transporter (SERT) binding assessed with [123I]nor-$\beta$-CIT SPECT. The psychotherapy process was analyzed with special emphasis on the change that was recognized in the dreaming process. The activation of the dream screen in transference seemed to form a turning point during the psychotherapy. Normalization of SERT binding at the midbrain level was found on 12-month follow-up. Major alleviation of depressive symptoms assessed by rating scales was evident only six months after SERT normalization.,2005.0,,GCAVM6E2,0,psychodynamic,985
985,From Lead Exposure in Early Childhood to Adolescent Health: A Chicago Birth Cohort,"Winter, A. S.; Sampson, R. J.","OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationships between childhood lead exposure and 3 domains of later adolescent health: mental, physical, and behavioral. METHODS: We followed a random sample of birth cohort members from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, recruited in 1995 to 1997, to age 17 years and matched to childhood blood test results from the Department of Public Health. We used ordinary least squares regression, coarsened exact matching, and instrumental variables to assess the relationship between average blood lead levels in childhood and impulsivity, anxiety or depression, and body mass index in adolescence. All models adjusted for relevant individual, household, and neighborhood characteristics. RESULTS: After adjustment, a 1 microgram per deciliter increase in average childhood blood lead level significantly predicts 0.06 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.01, 0.12) and 0.09 (95% CI = 0.03, 0.16) SD increases and a 0.37 (95% CI = 0.11, 0.64) point increase in adolescent impulsivity, anxiety or depression, and body mass index, respectively, following ordinary least squares regression. Results following matching and instrumental variable strategies are very similar.

The Vantaa Depression Study comprises a cohort of psychiatric inpatients and outpatients with major depressive disorder in the city of Vantaa, Finland. We prospectively interviewed 193 of 269 (72 \ \% \ ) patients both 6 and 18 months after baseline. Axis I and II diagnoses were assessed via semistructured WHO Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry 2.0 and SCID-II interviews. Global disability and social and work adjustment were assessed. Patients' functional disability and social adjustment were alleviated concurrently with recovery from depression during the follow-up. The current level of functioning and social adjustment of a patient with depression was predicted by severity of depression, recurrence before baseline and during follow-up, lack of full remission, and time spent depressed. Comorbid psychiatric disorders, personality traits (neuroticism), and perceived social support had significant influence.

988,Depression and its correlates among older adults accessing aging services,"Richardson, T. M.; Friedman, B.; Podgorski, C.; Knox, K.; Fisher, S.; He, H.; Conwell, Y.","Objectives: To define the prevalence and correlates of depression among older adults receiving assessments by nonmedical community-based care managers at the point of entry to care and thus prior to provision of aging services. Our long-term goal is to inform development of collaborative care models for late life depression that incorporate Aging Services Providers. Methods: Aging Services Provider Network (ASPN) clients receiving in-home assessments were administered the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID) module for affective disorders and measures of depression symptom severity, alcohol use, physical health, functional status, social support, stressful life events, and religiosity. Engagement in mental healthcare was documented. Results: Subjects (N = 378) were primarily white (84 \% ) and women (69 \% ) with household incomes under \$ 1,750/month (62 \% ). Half lived alone (48 \% ). Their mean age was 77 years. Thirty-one percent had clinically significant depressive symptoms and 27 \% met criteria for a current major depressive episode, of which 61 \% were being treated with medication and 25 \% by a mental health provider. Nearly half (47 \% ) had experienced one or more episodes of major depression during their lives. Disability, number of medical conditions, number and severity of recent stressful life events, low social support, and low religiosity were independently associated with current major depression. Conclusion: Depressive illness was common among this sample of ASPN clients. Because ASPN care managers have expertise in managing many of the problems correlated with depression, they may play a significant role in identifying, preventing, and collaborating in the treatment of depressive illnesses among community-dwelling older adults. \textcopyright 2012 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.",2012.0,10.1097/JGP.0b013e3182107e50,96RK58IH,0,diathesis,989
989,Treatment of older adults with co-morbid personality disorder and depression: a dialectical behavior therapy approach.,"Lynch, Thomas R.; Cheavens, Jennifer S.; Cukrowicz, Kelly C.; Thorp, Steven R.; Bronner, Leslie; Beyer, John","BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE: The treatment of personality disorders in older adults, particularly those co-morbid with other Axis I disorders (e.g., Major Depressive Disorder), is an understudied clinical phenomenon. It has also been demonstrated that personality disorders in older adults complicate treatment of other psychopathology, as well as result in heightened interpersonal disturbance and emotional distress. METHODS: Two studies utilizing standard Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) to treat depression and personality disorders in older adults are reviewed. Study 1 examined 34 chronically depressed individuals aged 60 and older who were randomly assigned to receive 28 weeks of antidepressant medication plus clinical management, either alone (MED) or with the addition of DBT skills-training and scheduled telephone coaching sessions (MED + DBT). Study 2 had two phases of treatment: Phase I: 8-week open-trial of antidepressant medication (n = 65); Phase II: 24-week randomized trial of DBT + MED versus MED alone for those who prospectively failed to respond to the Phase I medication trial (n = 37). RESULTS: Study 1 demonstrated that 71 \ \% \ of MED + DBT patients were in remission at post-treatment, in contrast to 47 \ \% \ of MED patients. This became a significant difference at the 6-month follow-up; where 75 \ \% \ of MED + DBT-D patients were in remission compared with only 31 \ \% \ of MED patients. Study 2 showed that after 8 weeks of treatment with antidepressant medication alone (Phase 1) only 14 \ \% \ of the sample had at least a 50 \ \% \ reduction in HAM-D scores. Phase II results showed on average, the DBT + MED group reached depression remission by the post-group assessment and maintained these gains while the MED group did not reach remission, until the follow-up assessment. Results demonstrated superiority of DBT + MED compared to MED alone on Interpersonal Sensitivity and Interpersonal Aggression at post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: Results from these two treatment development studies indicate that applying standard DBT for the treatment of co-morbid MDD or MDD + PD in older adults is feasible, acceptable, and has clinical promise. Modifications to standard DBT and an overview of a new treatment manual for this population are summarized.",2007.0,10.1002/gps.1703,UFG55HNG,0,personality,990
990,Guilt and femininity: The legacy of a retarded sister.,"Nyhamar, Turid","Describes the analysis of an adolescent female who had a mentally retarded sister, 2 yrs older than herself. The S had been referred by her parents for her depression and difficulties at school. At aged 10, 2 events occurred to the S: her mother's gallstone operation and her early menarche. The S's strong tendency to externalize was understood to be her defense against guilt feelings. The S wanted to be a successful female, but the wish to outdo all the females in her family seemed to be equivalent in her mind to gloating over their handicaps and wishing them dead. With the phase-appropriate revival of oedipal conflicts, she became unwilling to move into adolescence. She regressed, and she developed the symptom of depression. Several positive factors facilitated treatment: the S's basically healthy personality, the S's increased need for new models for identification in adolescence, and the good working alliance between the S and her analyst.

991,A comparison of MEmory Specificity Training (MEST) to education and support (ES) in the treatment of recurrent depression: Study protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial,"Dalgleish, Tim; Bevan, Anna; McKinnon, Anna; Breakwell, Lauren; Mueller, Viola; Chadwick, Isobel; Schweizer, Susanne; Hitchcock, Caitlin; Watson, Peter; Raes, Filip; Jobson, Laura; Werner-Seidler, Aliza","BACKGROUND: Depression is a debilitating mental health problem that tends to run a chronic, recurrent course. Even when effectively treated, relapse and recurrence rates remain high. Accordingly, interventions need to focus not only on symptom reduction, but also on reducing the risk of relapse by targeting depression-related disturbances that persist into remission. We are addressing this need by investigating the efficacy, acceptability and feasibility of a MEmory Specificity Training (MEST) programme, which directly targets an enduring cognitive marker of depression - reduced autobiographical memory specificity. Promising pilot data suggest that training memory specificity ameliorates this disturbance and reduces depressive symptoms. A larger, controlled trial is now needed to examine the efficacy of MEST. This trial compares MEST to an education and support (ES) group, with an embedded mechanism study. METHODS/DESIGN: In a single blind, parallel cluster randomised controlled trial, 60 depressed individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for a current major depressive episode will be recruited from the community and clinical services. Using a block randomisation procedure, groups of 5 to 8 participants will receive five weekly sessions of MEST (n = 30) or education and support (n = 30). Participants will be assessed immediately post-treatment, and at 3- and 6-months post-treatment (MEST group only for 6-month follow-up). Depressive symptoms at 3-month follow-up will be the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes will be change in depressive status and memory specificity at post-treatment and 3-months. The 6-month follow-up of the MEST group will allow us to examine whether treatment gains are maintained. An explanatory question will examine variables mediating improvement in depression symptoms post-treatment and at 3-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: This trial will allow us to investigate the efficacy of MEST, whether treatment gains are maintained, and the mechanisms of change. Evidence will be gathered regarding whether this treatment is feasible and acceptable as a low-intensity intervention. If efficacy can be demonstrated, the results will support MEST as a treatment for depression and provide the foundation for a definitive trial.

This study examined the efficacy and tolerability of the opioid antagonist naltrexone in adults with kleptomania who have urges to steal. Methods: An 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral naltrexone for kleptomania. Twenty-five individuals with DSM-IV kleptomania were randomized to naltrexone (dosing ranging from 50 mg/day to 150 mg/day) or placebo. Twenty-three subjects (92 \% ) completed the study. Subjects were assessed every 2 weeks with the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for Kleptomania (K-YBOCS), the urge and behavior subscales of the K-YBOCS, the Kleptomania Symptom Assessment Scale (K-SAS), the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI), and measures of depression, anxiety, and psychosocial functioning. Results: Subjects assigned to naltrexone had significantly greater reductions in K-YBOCS total scores (p = .001), stealing urges (p = .032), and stealing behavior (p \textless .001) compared with subjects on placebo. Subjects assigned to naltrexone also had greater improvement in overall kleptomania severity (reflected in the CGI scores) (p \textless .001). The mean effective dose of naltrexone was 116.7 (±44.4) mg/day. Conclusions: Naltrexone demonstrated statistically significant reductions in stealing urges and behavior in kleptomania.

Method: One hundred and seventy-one patients undertook a course of either CBT (n = 116) or GET (n = 55) and were assessed on a variety of self-report measures at pre- and posttreatment and follow-up. Aims: In this paper we present analyses on treatment outcomes for CBT and GET in routine clinical practice and evaluate whether changes on subscales of the Metacognitions Questionnaire-30 (MCQ-30) predict fatigue severity independently of changes in other covariates, and across the two treatment modalities. Results: Both CBT and GET were equally effective at decreasing fatigue, anxiety, and depression, and at increasing physical functioning. Changes on the subscales of the MCQ-30 were also found to have a significant effect on fatigue severity independently of changes in other covariates and across treatment modalities. Conclusion: The findings from the current study suggest that CFS treatment protocols for CBT and GET, based on those from the PACE trial, achieve similar to poorer outcomes in routine clinical practice as in a RCT.

Bilingual interviewers administered semistructured interviews that assessed sociodemographic characteristics (income, age, marital status, acculturation) and psychosocial factors (intimate partner violence (IPV), other lifetime trauma, depressive symptoms, and social support). Hierarchical linear regression analyses were conducted at each of the 3 time points in pregnancy and postpartum to identify the best predictors of PTSD symptoms. Results revealed that low-income, depressive symptoms and a history of other lifetime trauma were associated with symptoms of PTSD during pregnancy. After controlling for PTSD symptoms at baseline, PTSD symptoms at 7 months postpartum were associated with depressive symptoms, low perceived social support, and IPV history, but not history of other trauma. After controlling for PTSD symptoms at 7 months postpartum, PTSD symptoms at 13 months were associated with depressive symptoms and IPV. Screening for depressive symptoms and noninterpersonal trauma history in early pregnancy and for depressive symptoms, IPV, and social support postpartum in low-income Latina women may aid in identifying those at heightened risk for mental distress.

Previous studies have found that myeloperoxidase (MPO) may be a key inflammatory enzyme involved in this disorder. The purpose of this study was to determine the mRNA and protein levels of MPO in patients with rDD and to define the relationship between serum MPO levels and cognitive performance. MATERIAL/METHODS: The study comprised 236 subjects: patients with rDD (n=131) and healthy subjects (n=105, HS). Assessment of cognitive function was based on performance on the Trail Making Test, the Stroop Test, the Verbal Fluency Test (VFT) and the Auditory-Verbal Learning Test (AVLT). RESULTS: MPO gene expression at mRNA level and at protein level was significantly higher in the rDD group when compared to the HS (p \textless 0.01). There were no significant correlations for each group separately, but in the entire group, statistically significant correlations occurred between both mRNA and protein levels and following test: TMT part A and part B (positive correlations), part RCNb and part NCWd of the Stroop Test (positive correlation), the Verbal Fluency Test (negative correlation) and the AVLT (negative correlation).

998,Cognitive-behavioral Therapy for Treatment of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder and Related Problems,Nct,"Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) will affect nearly one in ten Canadians in their lifetime and more than 75% of them will develop at least one other related problem (i.e. depression). Results from a previous study suggest that CBT offering a flexible number of sessions and support for common related problems can improve the effectiveness of CBT. However, no studies have demonstrated the superior efficacy of flexible CBT compared to CBT targeting only PTSD to individuals with PTSD and common related problems. A randomized parallel‐stratified single‐blind controlled trial will be used. Randomization will be performed through www.randomized.net, a comprehensive internet‐based randomization service for clinical trials, with multiple Coordinating Center users (each with their own role). A total of 134 individuals will be randomized to one of two therapy conditions. Following the initial assessment, between 8 and 32 sessions with a psychologist will be offered to participants upon achievement of remission of the diagnosis of PTSD. Discontinuation of treatment will be decided in collaboration with the participant and will be considered on the basis of achieving a non‐clinical severity level of symptoms of PTSD on the PCL‐5 (i.e., score <33 and absence or non‐clinical level of severity of each of the symptoms). The participants will be re‐evaluated 3 times after their therapy (1 week, 3 months and 6 months post‐therapy) on primary and secondary measures. A 1 year post‐therapy follow‐up will also be provided for the primary measure only. Planned analysis. The statistical analysis will respect the ""intent‐to‐treat"" principle: the results of all randomized participants will be included in the groups in which they were originally assigned. The significance level is fixed at .05 and bilateral tests will be used. With regards to missing data, first the type of missing data will be determined (e.g. missing completely randomly). Thereafter, a multiple imputation strategy (3 to 5 imputations) will be used to replace the data and carry out the various analysis planned. This data replacement strategy is recognized as being robust and efficient in addition to resolving uncertainty due to missing data. Generalized linear models will be used to execute group comparisons (CBT‐C vs CBT‐E) on the main measurements using the pre‐treatment (T0) result as a covariate. The same strategy will be used for comparisons of the secondary variables and related problems. An analysis of the different parameters of effectiveness of the two forms of CBT (e.g. average number of sessions required to achieve remission, treatment strategy used) will be carried out. Subgroup analysis. No subgroup analysis is expected. Exploratory analysis will be conducted to determine if the results are generalizable to victims of both sexes and to the two major categories of traumatic exposures characterizing the sample recruited, namely violent criminal acts and workplace accidents. Sample size and calculations of treatment effects. Based on the treatment effect size observed in a pilot study on the effects of CBT‐E, similar research, and on the use of the GPower power calculation software, the sample size required to obtain statistical power of .80 with 3 follow‐ups, a significance level at .05 and bilateral testing for ANCOVA is 53 participants per group. A sample of 106 participants will allow for detections of differences in means between the two groups in terms of symptoms intensity of PTSD. It will also be adequate to verify the other assumptions and objectives of this project. Based on data from our recent studies on the efficacy of CBT‐C, and the literature on similar therapies (Bradley et al., 2005), the attrition rate is estimated to be 28% for participants who will be randomized in CBT‐C. For CBT‐E, the attrition rate observed during a pilot project was 14% (3 dropouts out of 21 participants). Given these attrition rates, recruitment for each of the therapies to achieve the required statistical power is calculated s follows: CBT‐C = 53 participants * attrition (28%) = 74; CBT‐E = 53 participants * attrition (14%) = 60). Consequently, a total of 134 participants will be randomized to one of the two conditions of therapy. Selection bias: The assignment to the intervention will be made only after the participant has agreed to participate in the study. Bias in statistical analysis: In order to minimize biases, the analysis will be carried out in a single‐blind manner, the statistician will not know which intervention refers to the code assigned to each of them in the database. Bias resulting from missing data and dropouts: All analysis will follow the ""intent to treat"" principle, in order to minimize biases stemming from missing data and drop‐outs during the intervention. Conducting a clinical trial on comparing the effectiveness of CBT with or without specific modules for patients with PTSD and related problems will increase the efficacy of CBT, innovate in the delivery of CBT, and improve the training of current and future clinicians. The results could also encourage victims' compensation boards to adjust their practices and thus improve the health of the beneficiaries.",2017.0,,UHMSSJ4X,0,additional,999

H.","BACKGROUND: A single-item assessment of sad mood after remission from MDD is predictive of relapse, yet the mechanisms that play a role in depressive relapse remain poorly understood. METHODS: In 283 patients, remitted from recurrent depression (DSM-IV-TR criteria; HAM-D17 score \textless /= 10), we examined emotional scarring, that is, whether the number of previous depressive episodes was associated with higher levels of sad mood as assessed with a 1-item Visual Analogue Mood Scale (VAMS). We then fitted a cross-sectional multivariate regression model to predict sad mood levels, including the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale Version-A, cognitive reactivity (Leiden Index of Depression Sensitivity), Ruminative Response Scale, and Everyday Problem Checklist. RESULTS: Patients with greater numbers of prior episodes experienced higher levels of sad mood after remission. In multivariate regression, intensity of daily stress and dysfunctional beliefs were associated with the VAMS (Adj. R(2)=.091) although not over and above depressive symptomatology (Adj. R(2)=.114). Cognitive reactivity was not associated with sadness. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding that patients with more previous MDEs reported higher levels of sad mood while remitted could be indicative of emotional scarring. Dysfunctional beliefs and intensity of daily stress were associated with sad mood but not over and above residual symptoms. Thus, illness related characteristics especially are associated with sad mood after remission. More negative affect after remission could result in lower stress tolerance or more stress intensity could result in negative affect. Future studies should examine premorbid sadness in a longitudinal cohort, and should study the exact pathway from stress, affect, and cognition to relapse.",2015.0,10.1016/j.comppsych.2015.02.010,T7YG84SL,0,cognitive,1001

F.; van Marwijk, H. W. J.; Smit, F.; van der Horst, H. E.; Bockting, C. L. H.","METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial among 248 patients with a history of depression, currently in full or partial remission or recovery. Participants were randomized to TAU augmented with S‐PCT (n = 124) or TAU alone (n = 124). S‐PCT consisted of an 8‐week self‐help intervention, supported by weekly telephone guidance by a counselor. The intervention included a self‐help book that could be read at home. The primary outcome was the incidence of relapse or recurrence and was assessed over the telephone by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM‐IV axis 1 disorders. Participants were observed for 12 months. Secondary outcomes were depressive symptoms, quality of life (EQ‐5D and SF‐12), comorbid psychopathology, and self‐efficacy. These secondary outcomes were assessed by digital questionnaires. RESULTS: In the S‐PCT group, 44 participants (35.5%) experienced a relapse or recurrence, compared to 62 participants (50.0%) in the TAU group (incidence rate ratio = 0.71, 95% CI 0.52‐0.97; risk difference = 14, 95% CI 2‐24, number needed to treat = 7). Compared to the TAU group, the S‐PCT group showed a significant reduction in depressive symptoms over 12 months (mean difference ‐2.18; 95% CI ‐3.09 to ‐1.27) and a significant increase in quality of life (EQ‐5D) (mean difference 0.04; 95% CI 0.004‐0.08). S‐PCT had no effect on comorbid psychopathology, self‐efficacy, and quality of life based on the SF‐12. CONCLUSIONS: A supported self‐help preventive cognitive therapy, guided by a counselor in primary care, proved to be effective in reducing the burden of recurrent depression. BACKGROUND: The burden and economic consequences of depression are high, mostly due to its recurrent nature. Due to current budget and time restraints, a preventive, low‐ cost, accessible minimal intervention is much needed.

C.","Purpose: To evaluate the relation between smoking and trauma exposure in a population-based, longitudinal sample. Contrary to current smoking trends in the general population, recent findings indicate continued high smoking rates in trauma-exposed samples. Methods: A nationally representative sample of 15,197 adolescents was followed from 1995 (mean age, 15.6 years) to 2002 (mean age, 22 years) as part of three waves of The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). We examined the relation between self-reported trauma exposure and smoking behaviors (lifetime regular, current regular), nicotine dependence based on the Fagerstr \ o m Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND), number of cigarettes smoked per day, and age of onset of regular smoking. Results: Controlling for demographics and depressive symptoms, exposure to traumatic events yielded a significant increase in the odds of lifetime regular smoking. Nicotine dependence and cigarettes smoked per day was also significantly related to exposure to childhood physical and sexual abuse. Decreased age of regular smoking onset was seen for those reporting childhood physical abuse and childhood sexual abuse. Conclusions: Exposure to traumatic life events during childhood and young adulthood increases the risk of smoking, highlighting the need to prevent and treat tobacco use in this vulnerable population. \textcopyright 2008 Society for Adolescent Medicine.",2008.0,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2007.08.029,5CH7BEPB,0,diathesis,1004

However, the factors which may predict the onset of major depression have yet to be fully examined. Method: We examined the control group of a randomized trial in primary care patients with subthreshold depression (N = 109), of whom 20 had developed major depression 1 year later. Using the vulnerability-stress theory, we examined which factors predicted the onset of major depression. Results: In both univariate and multivariate analyses, family history and chronic illnesses predicted the onset of major depression. Conclusion: It is possible to predict to a certain degree whether a subject with subthreshold depression will develop major depression within a year.

Eighty-eight of these patients met DSM-III-R criteria for at least one other diagnosis in addition to panic disorder. Moreover, 52 \ \% \ had a history of major depressive episode and 31 \ \% \ had a lifetime diagnosis of alcohol and/or other substance abuse. Compared with those who did not attempt suicide, those who attempted suicide were significantly more likely to have suffered from major depressive episode and alcohol or other substance abuse in their lifetime. Among the 35 patients with no comorbidity with either major depression or addictive behaviors, 17.1 \ \% \ had a history of suicide attempt.

Y.; Kleinsasser, A. L.; Lee-Furman, E.; Smits, J. A. J.; Zvolensky, M. J.; Rosenfield, D.","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is related to an increased risk of smoking cessation failure. In fact, the quit rate in smokers with PTSD (23.2 \% ) is one of the lowest of all mental disorders. Features of PTSD that contribute to smokers' progression to nicotine dependence and cessation relapse include negative affect, fear, increased arousal, irritability, anger, distress intolerance, and anxiety sensitivity. Anxiety sensitivity is higher in people with PTSD than in any other anxiety disorder except for panic disorder. High anxiety sensitivity is uniquely associated with greater odds of lapse and relapse during quit attempts. Distress intolerance, a perceived or behavioral tendency to not tolerate distress, is related to both the maintenance of PTSD and problems in quitting smoking. Prolonged exposure (PE) and interoceptive exposure (IE) reduce PTSD symptoms, distress intolerance, and anxiety sensitivity. Thus, they emerge as promising candidates to augment standard smoking cessation interventions for individuals with PTSD. The present study tests a 12-session specialized treatment for smokers with PTSD. This Integrated PTSD and Smoking Treatment (IPST) combines cognitive-behavioral therapy and nicotine replacement treatment for smoking cessation (standard care; SC) with PE to target PTSD symptoms and IE to reduce anxiety sensitivity and distress intolerance. Adult smokers (N = 80) with PTSD will be randomly assigned to either: (1) IPST or (2) SC. Primary outcomes are assessed at weeks 0, 6, 8, 10, 14, 16, 22, and 30.",2016.0,,VFFKABMX,0,cognitive,1007

A hierarchical model based on a psychodynamic theoretical framework was tested. According to this model, a generalized affective meaning connoting the whole field of participants' experience would have a regulative, downward, and causal influence on the specific meanings related to the issues addressed by the intervention. Secondary analyses-namely PLS Path Modeling with higher order constructs-were performed on a dataset resulting from a survey involving three hundred and ninety freshmen enrolled in a psychology course at the University of Salento, Italy. These analyses were aimed at detecting the anticipatory images of the University. Our findings provide evidence supporting the theoretical model proposed.

1009,Functional polymorphism of the glucocorticoid receptor gene associates with mania and hypomania in bipolar disorder,"Spijker, A. T. and","Objectives: In affective disorders, dysregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a frequently observed phenomenon. Subtle changes in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) functioning caused by polymorphisms of the GR gene (NR3C1) may be at the base of the altered reaction of the HPA axis to stress and subsequently related to the development and course of affective disorders. The aim of our study is to evaluate associations between GR gene polymorphisms and bipolar disorder (BD). Methods: In this study, 245 patients with BD were interviewed to confirm diagnosis and BD subtype. Data on medication use and sociodemographic details were also collected. The control group consisted of 532 healthy blood donors, from which data on sex and age were collected. To perform genotyping, blood was collected from all patients and healthy controls. Results: A trend was found for a protective effect of the exon 9$\beta$ polymorphism (p = 0.14) and the TthIII I polymorphism (p \textless 0.05) on the manifestation of the disease. These effects were significantly influenced by male gender for both polymorphisms. Patients with BD and the A/G variant in exon 9$\beta$ had significantly fewer manic and hypomanic episodes than noncarriers (p \textless 0.05). No further associations were found with the other investigated GR gene polymorphisms and BD. These findings were not corrected for multiple comparisons. Conclusions: We conclude that the exon 9$\beta$ polymorphism and the TthIIII polymorphism of the GR gene may be associated with a protective effect on the clinical manifestation and course in patients with BD. Furthermore, no associations were found between the other studied GR gene polymorphisms and this disease. \textcopyright 2009 The Authors Journal compilation \textcopyright 2009 Blackwell Munksgaard.",2009.0,10.1111/j.1399-5618.2008.00647.x,92E48L9N,0,diathesis,1010

Examining three and a half years of individual psychotherapy through the lens of attachment theory, the client's relationship to the author appeared to mimic an early attachment relationship and this psychotherapeutic attachment appeared to have contributed to the repair of the client's own insecure attachment to her mother. Through the course of the therapy the client was also able to develop her ability to regulate her emotional responses and create a coherent narrative of her life. She creatively worked through her fear of God as well as apparently circumvent the intergenerational transmission of insecure attachment to her adopted daughter.

METHODS: Scores on the Interpersonal Sensitivity Measure (IPSM) were compared between employed Japanese adults with and without a lifetime diagnosis of major depressive disorder. The diagnosis was provided by the Inventory to Diagnose Depression, Lifetime version. A multiple logistic regression analysis estimated the odds ratios for having a lifetime diagnosis of depression. RESULTS: The scores on the IPSM were higher in the subjects with a lifetime history of depression than those without a lifetime history of depression. On the five subscales of the IPSM, the subjects with a lifetime history of depression showed higher scores on 'interpersonal awareness', 'need for approval', and 'separation anxiety' than those without a lifetime history of depression. The multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the subjects with the high interpersonal sensitivity type of personality had an increased risk for experiencing lifetime depression. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that high interpersonal sensitivity is a risk factor for depression even in a non-clinical sample from non-Western culture.",1999.0,,BVKY6EHN,0,personality,1012

In a cross-sectional design, 259 Afghans completed surveys assessing perceived discrimination and a number of other factors using scales developed through inductive techniques. Multivariable analyses consisted of a series of hierarchical regressions testing the effect of perceived discrimination on distress, followed by a sequential analysis of moderator variables. Perceived discrimination was significantly associated with higher distress, and this relationship was stronger among those with a strong intra-ethnic identity and high pre-resettlement traumatic experiences. The expected buffering effects of civic engagement, ethnic orientation (e.g. integration), and social support were not significant. Discrimination is a significant source of stress for Afghan refugees, which may exacerbate stresses associated with other pre- and post-migration stressors.

College students with higher levels of learned resourcefulness develop greater self-confidence, motivation, and academic persistence, and are less likely to become anxious, depressed, and frustrated, but no studies specifically involve nursing students. This explanatory correlational study used Gadzella's Student-life Stress Inventory (SSI) and Rosenbaum's Self Control Scale (SCS) to explore learned resourcefulness, stressors, and academic performance in 53 baccalaureate nursing students. High levels of personal and academic stressors were evident, but not significant predictors of academic performance (p = .90).

1014,A rare case report-carjaval syndrome,"Gupta, A.; Gupta, K.; Khandelwal, S.; Saple, D. G.","Introduction & Objectives: Carvajal Syndrome is a cardiocutaneous syndrome consisting of wooly hair, striate palmoplantar keratoderma and dilated cardiomyopathy of left ventricle. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant fashion and is due to defect in gene Desmoplakin which is a intracellular protein that links desmosomal adhesion molecules to intermediate filaments of cytoskeleton. Due to mutations in genes encoding Cadherin, the integrity of desmosomal adhesion is disturbed and thus both skin and heart get involved because of instability to sustainmechanical stress. Material & Methods: Here is a case of 15 year old female patient visited at our clinic from Mumbai, born out of consanguinousmarriage and presented with wooly hair right since birth and palmoplantar keratoderma since past 7 years. Parents of the female child are not affected but her elder sister also had similar features for which she came to us 6 years back inMumbai and she expired 3 years back because of cardiac arrythmia. Brother of a patient is normal and no such associated clinical features are seen. Based on clinical features we are taking Naxos Disease and Carvajal Syndrome as our differential diagnosis. Results: Investigations: Chest X Ray- Borderline Cardiomegaly with left ventricle enlarged. 2DEcho-Dilated Cardiomyopathy, Left ventricle cavity dilated. Severely depressed Left Ventricular Systolic Function. LVEF=.20. Cardiac Valves Normal. Trivial Tricupsid regurgitation. Intact septa. No AP level shunt. Immunohistochemistry- Perinuclear localization of keratin in suprabasal keratinocytes, revealing a collapsed intermediate filament network. USG Abdomen- Normal with mild Spleenomegaly. Blood Reports-Normal with slight Eosinophilia. Thus with all the reports and relevant clinical features the diagnosis ismade as -CARVAJAL SYNDROME. Conclusions: We are reporting this casefor the rarity of this condition. Patient is under observation and helping to get some funds. Treatment: Emolients and Humectants are prescribed for Palmoplantar Keratoderma. Antiarrythmic Drugs are used for preventing recurrent episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia and for the treatment of congestive failure.

1015,Psychological determinants of erectile dysfunction: testing a cognitive-emotional model.,"Nobre, Pedro J.","INTRODUCTION: Recent studies have shown the impact of sexual dysfunctional beliefs, negative cognitive schemas, negative automatic thoughts, and depressed affect on male erectile dysfunction. Despite this fact, there are only few conceptual models that try to integrate these findings, and more importantly, there is a lack of studies that test the validity of those conceptual models. AIM: The aim of the present article was to test a cognitive-emotional model for erectile dysfunction. Taking previous research findings into account, we developed a cognitive-emotional model for erectile disorder (ED) and used path analysis to test it. METHODS: A total of 352 men (303 participants from the general population and 49 participants with a DSM-IV diagnosis of sexual dysfunction) answered a set of questionnaires assessing cognitive and emotional variables. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Erectile Function measured by the EF subscale of the International Index of Erectile Function, cognitive schemas measured by the Questionnaire of Cognitive Schema Activation in Sexual Context, sexual beliefs measured by the Sexual Dysfunctional Beliefs Questionnaire, thoughts and emotions measured by the Sexual Modes Questionnaire. RESULTS: The effects of the main proposed direct predictors explained 55 \% of the erectile function variance (R = 0.74). Most remaining direct effects proposed in the model were also statistically significant. The analysis of the absolute residuals showed that most of the implied correlations were close to the observed zero order correlations, indicated the adjustment of the model to the observed data. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the role played by cognitive and emotional factors on the predisposition and maintenance of male erectile dysfunction and suggest important implications for assessment and treatment of ED.",2010.0,10.1111/j.1743-6109.2009.01656.x,6DLAG2PU,0,cognitive_additional,1016

F.","Intermittent explosive disorder (IED), as described in DSM-5, is the categorical expression of pathological impulsive aggression. Previous work has identified neurobiological correlates of the disorder in patterns of frontal-limbic brain activity and dysregulation of serotonergic neurotransmission. Given the importance of short- and-long range white matter connections of the brain in social and emotional behavior, studies of white matter connectivity in impulsive aggression are warranted. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies in the related conditions of antisocial and borderline personality disorder have produced preliminary evidence of disturbed white matter connectivity in these disorders, but to date there have been no DTI studies in IED. A total of 132 male and female adults between the ages of 18 and 55 years underwent Turboprop-DTI on a 3-Tesla MRI scanner. Of these, 42 subjects had IED, 40 were normal controls, and 50 were clinical psychiatric controls with psychiatric disorders without IED. All subjects were free of alcohol, psychotropic medications, or drugs of abuse. The diffusion tensor was calculated in each voxel and maps of fractional anisotropy (FA) were generated. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) were used to compare FA along the white matter skeleton among the three subject groups. IED was associated with lower FA in two clusters located in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) when compared with the psychiatric and healthy controls. Impulsive aggression and borderline personality disorder, but not psychopathy or antisocial personality disorder, was associated with lower FA in the two clusters within the SLF. In conclusion, IED was associated with lower white matter integrity in long-range connections between the frontal and temporoparietal regions.",2016.0,,CRNKM7Z4,0,personality,1018
1018,Family involvement in the behavioral treatment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.,"Grunes, Michael Seth","The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of working with family members in the behavioral treatment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Specifically, a family treatment group was developed for family members of OCD patients. This group focused on psychoeducation, training in co-therapy, and support of family members. Measures of OCD symptoms included the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, the Padua Inventory - Washington State University Revision, and the Overvalued Ideation Scale. Measures of additional symptoms include the Beck Depression Inventory - Second Edition and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. Measures of dysfunctional family styles, or Expressed Emotion, are the Family Attitude Scale, The Family Emotional Involvement and Criticism Scale, and the Perceived Criticism Scale. A one-month follow up to measure maintenance of gains was also completed. Two groups of OCD patients (14 in each group) received Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) individually from a trained behavior therapist. In the treatment group, one family member participated in an eight-week family-intervention group for each of the 14 treatment group patients. In the control group, one family member was given the DV measures but no training for each patient. Results indicated that inclusion in the family treatment group resulted in a greater reduction in OCD symptoms than in control patients. Furthermore, anxiety and depression in treatment family members diminished significantly more than in control family members. Anxiety and depression of patients, however, did not significantly diminish in either the control or treatment groups. Expressed emotion, specifically perceived criticism, decreased more in treatment family members than in control family members. Patient levels of expressed emotion did not decrease significantly more in the treatment group. Further research in this area should include therapists who are blind to the treatment condition, larger n-size, a no treatment group, and more than one therapist to control for therapist variables. In addition, we need better EE measures, a longer follow up, and a study to measure EE as a prognostic indicator in OCD. Finally, the study suggests that there is an advantage to inclusion of family members in the behavior therapy of OCD patients.

Although the impact of depression is a concern in patients with diabetes, it is unknown whether there is an association between adherence to hypoglycemic medication and the decline of renal function in comorbid patients with diabetes and depression. We will conduct a cohort study aimed at examining (1) depression as a predictor of renal function decline, and (2) how adherence to hypoglycemic medication relates to depression and renal function decline in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS/DESIGN: In this multicenter cohort study, 550 patients with type 2 diabetes aged 20 years and older will be recruited at 20 outpatient clinics in general medicine and psychiatry. We will measure depression (Patient Health Questionnaire), medication adherence (medication possession ratio, Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, and one-item hypoglycemic medication adherence scale), and renal function (urinary albumin-creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate) at baseline and at the 12-month follow-up. The primary endpoint is decline of renal function at 12 months. The secondary endpoints include clinical variables, quality of life, and the attitude of professionals toward depression. We will perform multivariable linear regression analysis to evaluate the effects of medication adherence on the decline of renal function in comorbid patients with type 2 diabetes and depression. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this will be the first study to examine how adherence to hypoglycemic medication relates to the decline of renal function in comorbid patients with type 2 diabetes and depression. The results of the study will have implications for practitioners of diabetes care, policy makers, and researchers for the prevention and treatment of diabetic nephropathy.

The social-cognitive variables were measured in the context of breast reconstruction, while depression was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory. The structural equation modeling revealed that among the predictors there were only two that accounted for the intention to undergo breast reconstruction, i.e. self-efficacy and outcome expectancies (R2 = .67). Subsequent analyses of the related moderators, i.e. depression, age, and duration of the disease indicated a good fit to the data. Nevertheless, in subgroups with poorer resources (older age, depression, and longer duration of the disease) the direct effects of self-efficacy on intention were less noticeable or non-existent. The results suggest that self-efficacy may play the regulating role in making a breast reconstruction decision if individual resources are taken into account.

M.; Karp, J.; Reynolds, C.; Mulsant, B.; Sibille, E.; Kennedy, J.; Lenze, E.","Background: Treatment of late-life depression (LLD) with antidepressants is challenging and often a time-consuming task. More than 50% of patients with LLD do not achieve remission, which can lead to prolonged depressive symptoms associated with greater medical complications, progressive cognitive decline and an increased risk for dementia. Therefore, developing genomic biomarkers for antidepressant treatment response will be extremely important to optimize treatment and alleviate the burden of LLD. The objective of the current study was to conduct a genomewide association study (GWAS) to find novel variants associated with remission on venlafaxine treatment in LLD. In addition, we used post-GWAS approaches to characterize our findings in a biological context as well as to explore the overlapping genetic architecture between depression and Alzheimer's disease. Methods: Three-hundred and fifty-four participants (460 years) of mixed ancestry, diagnosed with major depression (MADRS415), were treated with open-label venlafaxine (up to 300 mg/day) for approximately 12 weeks. We genotyped 588,628 variants across the genome using the Illumina PsychArray BeadChip which was then imputed to the 1000 Genomes reference panel (Phase 3) using IMPUTE v.2.2. After imputation and restricting to a MAF≥1%, we included N= 7,389,525 variants. Associations with remission status (MADRS ≤ 10) and change in MADRS score were conducted using logistic/ linear regressions, adjusted for ancestry, sex, recruitment site, length in treatment, depressive episode duration, and baseline depressive severity. For associated regions, we conducted statistical and functional Bayesian fine-mapping to prioritize variants based on putative functionality, with particular enrichment across four depression-relevant brain tissues available through the Roadmap Epigenomics Project: cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, frontal lobe and substantia nigra. For a larger biological context, we conducted gene set enrichment analysis using Interval-based Enrichment Analysis (INRICH). Lastly, we compared the genomic architecture (i.e., shared genetic contributions between traits) of venlafaxine remission using GWAS summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) MDD GWAS and Alzheimer's disease from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) GWAS using a polygenic risk score (PRS) approach. Results: Although there were no variants survived corrections for multiple testing (po5 × 10-8) within our European- (N=310) or African- (N= 34) ancestry subsamples, we observed several suggestive associations within genes relevant for neuropsychiatric disorders. Our top hits with MADRS score change were located in variants near MIR1246 (β= 16.98, p =9.22 × 10-7) and in ERBB4 (β =6.46, p =5.35 × 10-7). ERBB4 which has been implicated in risk for schizophrenia, was also associated with post-ketamine treatment down regulation of GABA and glutamate levels in the rat prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, resulting in an antidepressant effect. We also observed a suggestive association between remission status and a variant in phosphodiesterase gene PDE9A (OR = 6.03, p =3.30 × 10- 6), suggesting a role in synaptic neurotransmitter signaling. PDE9A has been previously associated with risk for depression but not with response to fluoxetine or desipramine, two antidepressants of different classes. Our top empirically significant pathways included processes in telomere maintenance via recombination (GO:0000722), DNA-dependent DNA replication (GO:0006261) and positive regulation of cAMP biosynthetic process (GO:0030819). Overall, our PRS analyses revealed that there was no significant evidence for a shared genetic architecture between risk for MDD or Alzheimer's in both MADRS score change or remission status. However, there was a trend contribution to remission status from variants associated with MDD risk at a p-value threshold of p= 0.02 (NSNPs =4925, R2 = 0.008, p =0.09). Conclusions: Our study in a unique well-characterized sample of patients with LLD revealed i teresting suggestive genetic associations with measures of venlafaxine remission. Notably, ERBB4 was also implicated in ketamine response and suggests an involvement of GABA and glutamate signaling. As for PDE9A, our findings suggest a different underlying genetic contribution to response with venlafaxine compared to other antidepressants of different classes. Our pathway analyses indicated that processes involved in ageing including telomere and DNA integrity maintenance might be important for the etiology of depression in older adults. Our future steps include building integrated machine learning model to ultimately predict remission at baseline to optimize and personalized LLD treatment. In addition, we are working towards validating our findings in larger and pooled samples of depression in older adults.",2017.0,10.1038/npp.2017.264,IQYZLTWT,0,additional,1022

The chapter includes an in depth case study of it's use with a young patient. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is adapted for children and adolescents suffering from complex trauma through more emphasis on client preparation (Phase 2) assistance with expression of thoughts, feelings, and sensations (Phase 3) and cognitive interweaves, as needed, during reprocessing (Phase 4), For children removed from biological homes due to mistreatment, collaboration with a family therapist can help ensure that present-day caregivers provide appropriate support during EMDR. In addition, it can be useful to evaluate the parental response to determine if it is appropriate, and whether EMDR therapy is needed to ensure that the caregiver can be both present and an adequate attachment figure for the child. The delineation of EMDR and family therapy roles ensures that EMDR can be implemented every week. The EMDR practitioner can help traumatized children and adolescents by targeting and reprocessing memories to allow comprehensive changes in cognitive, affective, and somatic domains, leading to earned secure attachments and an integrated sense of self. By reprocessing targets involving past, present, and future, EMDR can help hurt children discover a new perspective regarding themselves, others, and their world. Timely treatment can prevent a lifelong trajectory of dysfunction and help end the transgenerational transmission of abuse and victimization fed by the unprocessed memories.

To date there is little data that reflects the experiences and perceptions of real-world patients with dabigatran. The abundance of Internet-based discussion forums and support groups related to AF or anticoagulation may provide a low-cost resource for assessing patient experiences. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine patient experiences and perceptions regarding dabigatran through qualitative thematic content analysis of comments posted on publicly accessible virtual discussion forums and Internet support groups. Measurements: Comments posted between January 2011 and September 2012 were downloaded from websites focusing on support of patients with AF or on anticoagulation therapy. Comments were analyzed for thematic content. Results: Five broad thematic categories emerged from the posted comments: general concerns about safety and efficacy, questions about indications and contraindications, questions about proper use and storage, questions about diet and drug restrictions, and experiences with perceived side effects. Our data revealed that a primary concern for patients taking dabigatran is the lack of antidote to reverse the effects of dabigatran if bleeding occurs. Several questions pertaining to the use of dabigatran with other medications or medical conditions were noted, and multiple patients expressed confusion about instructions for using dabigatran before and after medical procedures. An unexpected finding included several criticisms of the medication packaging, which many patients found inconvenient or difficult to open. Finally, several perceived side effects were noted, including some not reported in clinical trials. Conclusions: Online communities may provide information about topics that are a concern to patients and that may not be discernible in clinical trials, such as medication side effects, proper use, and safety. Our data also highlighted potential topics that may not be a priority to researchers but are nevertheless important to patients (e.g. medication convenience or packaging). Despite the growing use of online health-related communities, very little research makes use of this low-cost resource for identifying patient interests regarding therapeutic treatments to guide patient-oriented research. \textcopyright Springer International Publishing 2013.",2014.0,10.1007/s40271-013-0027-y,2BZ9BWMK,0,cognitive_additional,1025
1025,Women in Wetsuits: Revolting Bodies in Lesbian Surf Culture,"Roy, G.","The article unpicks the notion of lesbian bodies as revolting through an analysis of how women in wetsuits are experienced as both disgusting and desirable by lesbian surfers. Based on ethnographic research carried out within British surf culture, I consider how lesbian surfing bodies come to be experienced and embodied as disgusting, desirable, and revolting. Informed by interview data and personal reflections I suggest that the affective power of lesbian desire might offer ways in which to disrupt the cultural processes that shame bodies and in doing so enable surfing bodies to revolt. \textcopyright 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",2013.0,,CEVHPJKJ,0,psychodynamic,1026
1026,Physical Functioning: Effect of Behavioral Intervention for Symptoms Among Individuals With Cancer.,"Doorenbos, Ardith; Given, Barbara; Given, Charles; Verbitsky, Natalya","Background: Individuals with cancer receiving chemotherapy suffer deterioration in physical functioning due to symptoms arising from the cancer disease process and its treatment. Objectives: To determine if age, chronic health conditions (comorbidity), stage of cancer, depressive symptomatology, symptom limitations, sex, and site of cancer moderate the effects of cognitive behavioral intervention on physical function and to determine if symptom limitations mediate the effect of the intervention on physical functioning. Methods: Two hundred thirty-seven individuals with solid tumor cancer (118 experimental and 119 control group) participated in this 10-contact, 18-week randomized control trial. Cognitive behavioral theory guided the nurse-delivered problem-solving experimental intervention. The control group received conventional care. Interviews occurred at baseline and 10, 20, and 32 weeks. Results: Women with breast cancer had significantly better physical functioning than women with lung cancer. Chronic health conditions, symptom limitation, and depressive symptomatology at baseline were found to moderate the effect of intervention on physical function. Symptom limitation, however, was not found to mediate the effect of intervention on physical functioning. Discussion: The intervention was shown to affect physical function trajectories differently for individuals with different personal and health characteristics. Because poor physical functioning is strongly associated with mortality and poor quality of life, this information may be used by health professionals to target interventions to those who might be most responsive.

Life-time risks of depression were investigated by structured clinical interviews (SADS-LA) in both a high-risk sample of depressed patients' first-degree relatives and an unscreened control sample of the general population: 34.6 \ \% \ of the high-risk sample versus 23.1 \ \% \ of controls were cases of depression, with a female preponderance in both groups. The rates of treated depression were 17.0 \ \% \ versus 8.5 \ \% \ . Female sex, greater age, higher severity of episodes, manic or hypomanic episodes recurrent course, and introverted and anancastic personality were factors increasing the rate of treated cases in both samples, as well as familial loading with treated depression. Late onset and chronicity of depression did not significantly affect these proportions, but controlling for the effects of retrospective assessment by focusing only on depression within the past year confirmed the results. However, the major finding of a familial influence in treatment-seeking behaviour might be due to a personality factor running in families, as well as to a sharing of common environmental factors.",1992.0,,JZZB9JEA,0,personality,1028

Harrington; Herrera, Veronica M.; Stuewig, Jeffrey","This study examines male-to-female physical abuse within adolescent relationships. Analyses use data describing 603 opposite sex relationships reported during Wave II of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) matched with data on the individual characteristics of both the reporting females and their male partners from Wave I. In addition to the occurrence of physical abuse, relationship data included information on the seriousness of the relationships. Female and male participants' scores on 14 individual-level variables were used to predict abuse. The first set of analysis found that male-to-female abuse was predicted by 6 individual characteristics of males and 6 individual characteristics of females. Only one of these characteristics, grade point average (GPA), was a significant predictor of the occurrence of male-to-female abuse for both male and female relationship participants. The other characteristics were each only predictive for either males--Verbal IQ, Fighting, Attitudes About Sex and Relationships, and Past Sexual Behavior, or females--Mother Relationship, School Attachment, Drinking Behaviors, and Depression...

The authors examined the role of academic entitlement as a mediator of the relationship between permissive parenting and psychological functioning. Participants: Participants were 524 undergraduate students at a single institution (52 \% female; age range = 18-22). Data collection was completed in May 2011. Methods: Cross-sectional design. Participants completed online self-report measures of parenting styles, academic entitlement, stress, depressive symptoms, and well-being. Results: Permissive parenting was associated with greater academic entitlement and, in turn, to more perceived stress and poorer mental health. Mother/father differences were found in some cases. Conclusions: Academic entitlement may partially explain why permissive parenting is detrimentally related to mental health for college students. Implications for academic affairs and counseling include helping students develop an appreciation of the role of self-regulation in college success.

L.; Skre, I.; Kvernmo, S.","Objectives. To examine whether enculturation factors, like cultural activities, ethnic pride and native language competence, are related to decreased internalizing and externalizing symptoms in Indigenous Sami youth from Arctic Norway. The impact of self-efficacy on the relationship between enculturation factors and mental health problems was also examined. Study design. Population-based, cross-sectional questionnaire study. Methods. The Norwegian Arctic Adolescent Health Study was conducted among 10th graders in junior high schools in north Norway during 2003-2005. The study sample consisted of 450 Indigenous Sami youth, aged 15-16 years. Internalizing symptoms were measured with the Hopkins Symptom Check List-10 (HSCL-10), while externalizing symptoms were measured by two subscales of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Results. For boys, self-efficacy and participation in cultural activities were associated with decreased internalizing symptoms. Additionally, self-efficacy interacted with Sami language competence and cultural activities: when self-efficacy increased, these enculturation factors were related to symptom reduction. For girls, self-efficacy had an independent effect on internalizing symptoms and also strengthened the relationship between participation in cultural activities and reduced externalizing symptoms. Sami language competence was related to the reduction of both internalizing and externalizing symptoms in girls. Conclusions. In the present study, several enculturation factors as well as self-efficacy were identified as potential protective factors against mental health problems.

B.; Wr, Beardslee; Tr, Gladstone; Ej, Wright; Ab, Cooper; Beardslee, W. R.; Gladstone, T. R.; Wright, E. J.; Cooper, A. B.","OBJECTIVE: Depression in parents is a prevalent and impairing illness that is encountered frequently in medical practice. Children of depressed parents are at risk for psychopathology and other difficulties. A series of recent national reports have recommended the development of prevention efforts targeting children of depressed parents. Yet, to date, few controlled prevention studies of depression in children and adolescents have been conducted. In this study, we report the evaluation of 2 preventive intervention strategies that target children living in homes with depressed parents. Both are public health approaches that were designed to be used by a wide range of practitioners from a variety of disciplines, including pediatricians, internists, school counselors, nurses, and mental health practitioners. We adopted a developmental perspective and intervened with families when children were entering the age of highest risk for depression onset (ie, adolescence). We chose a family-based approach to prevention and sought to reduce risk factors and enhance protective factors for early adolescents by increasing positive interactions between parents and children, and by increasing understanding of the illness for everyone in the family. Our prevention approaches were designed to provide information about mood disorders to parents, to equip parents with the skills they need to communicate information to their children, and to open a dialogue with their children about the effects of parental depression. We hypothesized that participation in these prevention programs would result in parental change in child-related behaviors and attitudes about depression and its impact on the family. In addition, we hypothesized that this parental change would produce change in children's self-understanding, and in children's depressive symptomatology. METHODS: We conducted a large-scale efficacy trial of 2 manual-based preventive intervention programs that were designed to be used widely in public health settings. These interventions target the relatively healthy children (ages 8-15) of parents with mood disorder. Ninety-three families (88.5 \% of our initial sample), including 121 children, participated in this study through the fourth assessment point. These families were assigned randomly to either a lecture or a clinician-facilitated intervention. Both interventions were specified in manuals. The lecture condition consisted of 2 separate meetings delivered in a group format without children present. The clinician-facilitated condition consisted of 6 to 11 sessions, including separate meetings with parents and children, and a family meeting in which the parents led a discussion of the illness and of positive steps that can be taken to promote healthy functioning in the children. In addition, telephone contacts or refresher meetings were conducted at 6- to 9-month intervals. In both conditions, psychoeducational material about mood disorders, risk, and resilience was presented and efforts were made to decrease feelings of guilt and blame in children. Parents were helped to build resilience in their children through encouraging their friendships, their success outside of the home, and their understanding of parental illness and of themselves. In addition, in the clinician-facilitated condition, efforts were made to link the psychoeducational material presented to the family's own unique illness experience. To address directly how their lives had changed, all family members in both conditions were assessed for psychopathology and for overall functioning at intake, and for psychopathology, functioning, and response to intervention immediately postintervention, approximately 1 year postintervention, and again approximately 2.5 years postintervention. RESULTS: We examined the outcomes of child understanding and internalizing symptomatology, and a number of predictor variables, using repeated measures analyses with generalized estimating equations.

1035,The impact of trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder on the treatment response of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Shavitt, R. G.; Valrio, C.; Fossaluza, V. and","Few case series studies have addressed the issue of treatment response in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and there are no prospective studies addressing response to conventional treatment in OCD patients with a history of trauma (HT). The present study aimed to investigate, prospectively, the impact of HT or PTSD on two systematic, first-line treatments for OCD. Two hundred and nineteen non-treatment-resistant OCD outpatients were treated with either group cognitive-behavioral therapy (GCBT n = 147) or monotherapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI n = 72). Presence of HT and PTSD were assessed at intake, as part of a broader clinical and demographical baseline characterization of the sample. Severity and types of OCD symptoms were assessed with the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) and the Dimensional YBOCS (DYBOCS), respectively. Depression and anxiety symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Both treatments had 12-week duration. Treatment response was considered as a categorical [35 \% or greater reduction in baseline YBOCS scores plus a Clinical Global Impression-Improvement rating of better (2) or much better (1)] and continuous variable (absolute number reduction in baseline YBOCS scores). Treatment response was compared between the OCD + HT group versus the OCD without HT group and between the OCD + PTSD group versus the OCD without PTSD group. Parametric and non-parametric tests were used when indicated. Data on HT and PTSD were available for 215 subjects. Thirty-eight subjects (17.67 \% of the whole sample) had a positive HT (OCD + HT group) and 22 subjects (57.89 \% of the OCD + HT group and 10.23 \% of the whole sample) met full DSM-IV criteria for PTSD. The OCD + HT and OCD without HT groups presented similar response to GCBT (60 \% of responders in the first group and 63 \% of responders in the second group, p = 1.00). Regarding SSRI treatment, the difference between the response of the OCD + HT (47.4 \% ) and OCD without HT (22.2 \% ) groups was marginally significant (p = 0.07). In addition, the OCD + PTSD group presented a greater treatment response than the OCD without PTSD group when treatment response was considered as a continuous variable (p = 0.01). The age when the first trauma occurred had no impact on treatment response. In terms of specific OCD symptom dimensions, as measured by the DYBOCS, OCD treatment fostered greater reductions for the OCD + PTSD group than for the OCD without PTSD group in the scores of contamination obsessions and cleaning compulsions, collecting and hoarding and miscellaneous obsessions and related compulsions (including illness concerns and mental rituals, among others). The OCD + PTSD group also presented a greater reduction in anxiety scores than the OCD without PTSD group (p = 0.003). The presence of HT or PTSD was not related to a poorer treatment response in this sample of non-treatment-resistant OCD patients. Unexpectedly, OCD patients with PTSD presented a greater magnitude of response when compared with OCD without PTSD patients in specific OCD symptom dimensions. Future studies are needed to clarify if trauma and PTSD have a more significant impact on the onset and clinical expression of OCD than on the conventional treatment for this condition, and whether OCD stemming from trauma would constitute a subtype of OCD with a distinct response to conventional treatment. \textcopyright 2009 Springer-Verlag.",2010.0,10.1007/s00406-009-0015-3,AQPVEX43,0,diathesis,1036
1036,Depression in adults: Some basic facts,"McQueen, D.","This paper reviews some of the essential facts about depression in adults. The term can refer to a symptom, a syndrome or a diagnosis. As a symptom, it occurs in many mental disorders and physical diseases. The boundaries of depression are reviewed: depression is biologically distinct from bipolar affective disorder, but it overlaps with the other common neurotic conditions; the spectrum of depressive disorders, melancholia, depressive adjustment reactions and dysthymia is described. Categorical classifications of depression have many problems, but are currently necessary. The epidemiology of depression in adulthood is presented with reference to old age, after childbirth, its prognosis and long-term disability and the limitations of short-term treatments. The immediate causes of depression include complex interactions between life events and their personal meaning influenced by personality factors and neuroticism. Ethological perspectives indicate that depression may have both adaptive and maladaptive aspects. \textcopyright 2009 The Association for Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy in the NHS.",2009.0,,YIQG9UEV,0,psychodynamic,1037

Supporting the hypotheses, the results showed that employability orientation was positively related to openness, initiative, and the career anchors of managerial competence and variety, and negatively related to tenure, continuance commitment, and the career anchors of technical competence and security. Career anchors mediated the relationship between openness, initiative, and employability orientation; continuance commitment mediated the relationship between tenure and employability orientation. No relationships were found between affective commitment, career development support, and employability orientation; an unexpected negative relationship existed between employability orientation and perceptions of organizational support. Employability orientation proved a strong predictor of employability activities. The implications of this study for employability interventions and for future research are discussed.

This study also identifies potential key variables to be included in an educational program to decrease alcohol use during pregnancy. Three hundred and seventy two questionnaires were completed by pregnant women attending prenatal clinics. The typical respondent was 25.3 years of age with 12.9 completed years of education. Of the respondents, 71.9 \% were white and 20.8 \% were African American. A majority (78.5 \% ) of the respondents reported they did not currently consume any alcohol. MANOVA and multiple regression (logistic regression) statistical procedures were used to explore the association and predictability of drinking behavior with the dimensions of HBM and FHLC measures. Perceived cues was the single most important predictor of drinking behavior. Responses to the perceived cues items were also influenced by race, and parity. Knowledge regarding the effects of alcohol use during pregnancy was the second best predictor of drinking behavior. There was considerable variability in the respondents' knowledge about the effects of alcohol on pregnancy. Perceived benefits was also a predictor of drinking behavior and the responses to the perceived benefits items were influenced by race. Chance and powerful others subscales of the FHLC scale were overall predictors of drinking behavior while the internal subscale was not a predictor of drinking behavior. A major implication of this study is the identification of key variables to be considered in designing educational interventions to decrease drinking during pregnancy. These key variables include dealing with stress and depression, and finding alternate ways of making a pregnant woman feel good or relax other than by drinking. Other implications for designing programs for prevention of FAS/FAE are targeting appropriate populations for education, involving doctors in the education programs, and imparting appropriate knowledge which helps in decreasing drinking during pregnancy.

The authors investigated the demographics, phenomenology, course, associated psychopathology, family history, and response to treatment in a series of 30 patients with the disorder. METHOD: The patients (including 12 whose preoccupation was of probable delusional intensity) were assessed with a semistructured interview and the Structural Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R, and their family histories were obtained. RESULTS: The 17 men and 13 women reported a lifetime average of four bodily preoccupations, most commonly defects of the hair, nose, and skin. The average age at onset of body dysmorphic disorder was 15 years, and the average duration was 18 years. Seventy-three percent of the patients reported associated ideas or delusions of reference; 73 \% , excessive mirror checking; and 63 \% , attempts to camouflage their deformities. As a result of their symptoms, 97 \% avoided usual social and occupational activities, 30 \% had been housebound, and 17 \% had made suicide attempts. Ninety-three percent of the patients had an associated lifetime diagnosis of a major mood disorder; 33 \% , a psychotic disorder; and 73 \% , an anxiety disorder. The patients generally responded poorly to surgical, dermatologic, and dental treatments and to adequate trials of most psychotropic medications, with the exception of fluoxetine and clomipramine (to which more than half had a complete or partial response).

First, internal perturbation-based reasons for attempting suicide statistically predicted each suicide criterion. Second, these reasons often outperformed hopelessness in statistically predicting suicide criteria. Third, associations among suicide criteria and psychological variables were multidimensional, not unidimensional. In particular, independent dimensions of Negative Cognitions and Action Orientation emerged and replicated previous findings. Implications of these results are discussed.

A.; Paulson, J. L.; Peters, J. R.; Rubinow, D. R.; Girdler, S. S.","OBJECTIVE: Women with menstrually related mood disorders (MRMDs) demonstrate clinically significant distress during the premenstrual week that remits with the onset of menses. Relatively little is known about psychosocial mechanisms of MRMDs. Given the core affective and behavioral symptoms of MRMDs, dysfunctional responses to emotion (e.g., difficulties with awareness and regulation of emotion; rumination and impulsive or maladaptive behavior in response to emotion) may be important factors to explore as cognitive and behavioral mechanisms in MRMDs. The purpose of the present study was to examine the associations of various dysfunctional responses to emotion (as measured using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale [DERS] and brooding on the Ruminative Responses Scale [RRS]) with premenstrual symptom severity and trajectory. METHOD: A total of 54 women (mean age = 38.11; 65% Caucasian) with prospectively confirmed MRMDs completed the DERS and RRS, and provided 2-4 menstrual cycles of daily symptom reports. RESULTS: Only the emotion-related impulsivity subscale of the DERS was robustly associated with premenstrual symptom severity. Brooding rumination predicted a more rapid premenstrual increase and slower postmenstrual remission of some symptoms. CONCLUSION: Both rumination and emotion-related impulsivity may be important treatment targets in cognitive behavioral interventions aimed at reducing symptom severity and cyclicity in MRMDs.",2018.0,10.1002/jclp.22522,JTLRPQH9,0,additional,1043

1044,Patterns of Psychological Adaptation to Spousal Bereavement in Old Age.,"Spahni, Stefanie; Morselli, Davide; Perrig-Chiello, Pasqualina; Bennett, Kate Mary","BACKGROUND: While the negative effects of spousal bereavement on well-being are well documented in empirical research, the large individual differences in psychological adaptation are still not well understood. OBJECTIVE: This contribution aims to identify patterns of psychological adaptation to spousal loss in old age and to shed light on the role of intra- and interpersonal resources and contextual factors as discriminant variables among these patterns. METHODS: The data stem from a cross-sectional questionnaire study of 402 widowed individuals (228 women, 174 men) aged between 60 and 89 years (mean age 74.41 years), who lost their partner within the last 5 years, and 618 married individuals, who served as controls (312 women, 306 men; mean age 73.82 years). RESULTS: The exploratory latent profile analysis of the well-being outcomes of depressive symptoms, hopelessness, loneliness, life satisfaction and subjective health revealed three different groups in the widowed sample: 'resilients' (54 \% of the sample), 'copers' (39 \% ) and 'vulnerables' (7 \% ). The most important variables for group allocation were intrapersonal resources - psychological resilience and the Big Five personality traits - but also the quality of the former relationship and how the loss was experienced. CONCLUSION: Successful adaptation to spousal loss is primarily associated with high scores in psychological resilience and extraversion and low scores in neuroticism. Our results shed light on the variability in psychological adaptation and underline the important role of intrapersonal resources in facing spousal loss in old age.",2015.0,10.1159/000371444,HNHYXNJK,0,personality,1045
1045,Differences between smokers and nonsmokers with anxiety disorders.,"Morissette, Sandra Baker; Brown, Timothy A.; Kamholz, Barbara Wolfsdorf; Gulliver, Suzy Bird","Epidemiological data suggest that early smoking increases the risk for emergence of certain anxiety disorders (e.g., panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)), and that presence of certain anxiety disorders (e.g., social anxiety) increases the risk for later development of nicotine dependence. Although some studies report a high prevalence of smoking among anxiety disorders, the extent to which smokers with anxiety disorders differ from their nonsmoking counterparts remains uncertain. Differences between smokers and nonsmokers with anxiety disorders (N=527) were examined with respect to multiple measures of theoretical and clinical interest. Compared to nonsmokers, smokers with anxiety disorders reported greater anxiety sensitivity, anxiety symptoms, agoraphobic avoidance, depressed mood, negative affect, stress and life interference; however, these differences were largely accounted for by panic disorder. No differences were found between smokers and nonsmokers regarding social anxiety, worry, obsessive-compulsive symptoms or positive affect. Differential patterns were observed when evaluating constructs within anxiety disorder diagnoses.",2006.0,10.1016/j.janxdis.2005.08.003,HXYLISIS,0,cognitive_additional,1046
1046,A case report of cognitive behavioural therapy for social anxiety in an ultra-high risk patient,"Haglund, M.; Cabaniss, D.; Kimhy, D.; Corcoran, C. M.","Aim:: Psychological treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may have efficacy in young people at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis. Case reports can illuminate the obstacles and challenges, and potential trajectory of symptom changes, observed with this treatment. Methods:: This is a detailed case report of a young adult at UHR for psychosis who received manualized CBT for accompanying social anxiety. Results:: Cognitive deficits and suspiciousness created initial challenges for successful implementation of CBT. Engagement in treatment occurred with slowing of pace and simplification of material, and modelling of social interaction. Treatment of social anxiety was accompanied by decreases in suspiciousness, conceptual disorganization, and social anhedonia, and increase in range of affect. Conclusions:: Adaptation of manualized CBT to accommodate cognitive deficits and suspiciousness in UHR patients may improve engagement. CBT focused on social anxiety can lead to improvement across symptom domains in UHR patients. \ \textcopyright \ 2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",2014.0,,9Y2V3B5N,0,behavior,1047
1047,Prognostic and diagnostic potential of the structural neuroanatomy of depression.,"Costafreda, Sergi G.; Chu, Carlton; Ashburner, John; Fu, Cynthia H. Y.","BACKGROUND: Depression is experienced as a persistent low mood or anhedonia accompanied by behavioural and cognitive disturbances which impair day to day functioning. However, the diagnosis is largely based on self-reported symptoms, and there are no neurobiological markers to guide the choice of treatment. In the present study, we examined the prognostic and diagnostic potential of the structural neural correlates of depression. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Subjects were 37 patients with major depressive disorder (mean age 43.2 years), medication-free, in an acute depressive episode, and 37 healthy individuals. Following the MRI scan, 30 patients underwent treatment with the antidepressant medication fluoxetine or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Of the patients who subsequently achieved clinical remission with antidepressant medication, the whole brain structural neuroanatomy predicted 88.9 \% of the clinical response, prior to the initiation of treatment (88.9 \% patients in clinical remission (sensitivity) and 88.9 \% patients with residual symptoms (specificity), p = 0.01). Accuracy of the structural neuroanatomy as a diagnostic marker though was 67.6 \% (64.9 \% patients (sensitivity) and 70.3 \% healthy individuals (specificity), p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: The structural neuroanatomy of depression shows high predictive potential for clinical response to antidepressant medication, while its diagnostic potential is more limited. The present findings provide initial steps towards the development of neurobiological prognostic markers for depression.",2009.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0006353,GLEIVZIC,0,cognitive,1048

Data were collected in a community-based study using qualitative and quantitative techniques. Results indicate that those Sudanese for whom life in Canada was not what they expected and those who experienced economic hardship as measured by worry over having enough money for food or medicine experienced poorer overall health and reported a greater number of symptoms of psychological distress. After controlling for demographic and related variables, we found that individuals who were experiencing economic hardship were between 2.6 and 3.9 times as likely to experience loss of sleep, constant strain, unhappiness and depression, and bad memories as individuals who do not experience hardship. Healthcare providers should be aware of how postmigration social disadvantages may increase the risk of mental distress particularly among refugees.",2006.0,10.1177/1363461506066985,7LGTI33W,0,cognitive_additional,1049
1049,Effectiveness of brief metacognitive therapy versus cognitive-behavioral therapy in a general outpatient setting.,"Nordahl, Hans M.","This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of brief metacognitive therapy when applied to a representative sample of treatment resistant patients in a clinic setting. Patients were typically heterogenous with a range of comorbid diagnoses and the majority had failed to respond to medication. They were randomly assigned to treatment as usual (n = 13; TAU), or metacognitive therapy (n = 15; MCT). TAU consisted of cognitive-behavior therapy. Improvements in depression, anxiety, and worry were observed in both treatments. Patients receiving MCT showed significantly greater levels of improvement in anxiety and worry than those receiving TAU. It is tentatively concluded that MCT can be safely and effectively delivered as a brief treatment in a heterogenous clinical practice setting.

1050,Assessment and management of patients with medically unexplained symptoms in primary care,"Morriss, R.; Gask, L.","Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are common in primary care and associated with high healthcare usage, impaired function or distress. They are not explainable by lasting organic pathology. Usually they have a reversible physiological explanation, they are precipitated by life stress or modern lifestyle, and sometimes they are associated with depressive and anxiety disorders. The definition is more acceptable to GPs than somatoform disorder because it does not suggest a psychiatric process and does not require lifetime symptom counts in a busy surgery. Most patients seek an alliance with their general practitioner (GP) to legitimize their distress and help understand their cause, but GPs commonly manage MUS using a biomedical model rather than manage the underlying distress. The article outlines a number of useful assessment and management approaches to MUS in primary care. Reattribution is a structured consultation used by GPs to provide patients with an explanation for their MUS in terms of life stress, lifestyle or psychiatric disorder. The use of regular appointments to manage chronic MUS associated with high consultation rates is also established. Graded exercise and antidepressants can be helpful in patients with particular types of MUS. Cognitive behavioural therapy is a helpful second line treatment but few GPs are currently willing to utilize it. Despite the high distress and cost of these patients, there are few incentives to GPs to manage MUS in health systems around the world. \textcopyright 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

S.","Adolescents are often resistant to interventions that reduce aggression in children. At the same time, they are developing stronger beliefs in the fixed nature of personal characteristics, particularly aggression. The present intervention addressed these beliefs. A randomized field experiment with a diverse sample of Grades 9 and 10 students (ages 14-16, n = 230) tested the impact of a 6-session intervention that taught an incremental theory (a belief in the potential for personal change). Compared to no-treatment and coping skills control groups, the incremental theory group behaved significantly less aggressively and more prosocially 1 month postintervention and exhibited fewer conduct problems 3 months postintervention. The incremental theory and the coping skills interventions also eliminated the association between peer victimization and depressive symptoms.",2013.0,10.1111/cdev.12003,HTK5YZGW,0,personality,1052
1052,How attachment and excessive self-sacrificing depressive dynamics are related to couple relationship satisfaction over time.,"Naud, Christopher; Lussier, Yvan; Sabourin, Stephane; Normandin, Lina; Clarkin, John F.; Kernberg, Otto F.","In this longitudinal study, we examined within a dyadic perspective how romantic attachment and depressive-masochistic personality (DMP) predicted initial and long-term relationship satisfaction 1 year and 3 years after initial testing through direct and interaction effects. A sample of 299 couples completed romantic attachment, personality organization, and relationship satisfaction questionnaires. For both women and men, initial satisfaction was directly predicted by self-reported attachment representations (anxiety and avoidance) and DMP traits. In addition to these actor effects, three direct partner effects were observed: women's couple satisfaction was associated with men's avoidance whereas in men, couple satisfaction was predicted by women's avoidance and DMP traits. On the other hand, only women's DMP was directly related to men's long-term satisfaction. Several interaction effects were found in predicting long-term satisfaction mainly as a function of women's DMP. When women presented elevated DMP traits, the negative relation between attachment avoidance and long-term satisfaction was eliminated and attachment anxiety became positively related to women's long-term satisfaction. Attachment representations appear to have a different and more complex relation with long-term couple satisfaction when considering its interactions with pathological personality traits.

1053,Effects of complementary and integrative medicine on cancer survivorship.,"Frenkel, Moshe; Sierpina, Victor; Sapire, Kenneth","Cancer survivorship has become a topic of great interest in the past few years. Unfortunately, even with successful treatment as well as good follow-up care, many patients continue to experience unmet physical, emotional, and spiritual needs as well as having an unsettling fear, fear of recurrence, a fear which most survivors share, even many years after their treatment ended. As a result, patients are continually looking for additional ways to address these needs and fears. Among the most popular approach is the use of complementary and integrative medicine (CIM). Most studies on CIM use among cancer patients and survivors concentrate on symptom improvement and improvement of quality of life and do not touch a crucial question if these therapies can affect patients' survival in terms of prolongation of life. Interestingly, in recent years, there are a growing number of studies that suggest that approaches such as mind-body interventions, enhanced general nutrition, nutritional supplements, physical activity, and other CIM approaches may have a positive effect on survival of cancer patients. Although additional studies are needed to confirm these findings, given the low cost of these CIM interventions, their minimal risk, and the potential magnitude of their effects, these approaches might be considered as additional important tools to integrate into cancer survivorship care plans.",2015.0,10.1007/s11912-015-0445-1,9Q5A9GUK,0,cognitive,1054
1054,First-person Pronoun Use in Spoken Language as a Predictor of Future Depressive Symptoms: Preliminary Evidence from a Clinical Sample of Depressed Patients,"Zimmermann, J.; Brockmeyer, T.; Hunn, M.; Schauenburg, H.; Wolf, M.","Several theories suggest that self-focused attention plays an important role in the maintenance of depression. However, previous studies have predominantly relied on self-report and laboratory-based measures such as sentence completion tasks to assess individual differences in self-focus. We present a prospective, longitudinal study based on a sample of 29 inpatients with clinical depression, investigating whether an implicit, behavioural measure of self-focused attention, i.e., the relative frequency of first-person singular pronouns in naturally spoken language, predicts depressive symptoms at follow-up over and above initial depression. We did not find a significant cross-sectional association between depressive symptoms and first-person singular pronoun use. However, first-person singular pronoun use significantly predicted depressive symptoms approximately 8 months later, even after controlling for depressive symptoms at baseline or discharge. Exploratory analyses revealed that this effect was mainly driven by the use of objective and possessive self-references such as 'me' or 'my'. Our findings are in line with theories that highlight individual differences in self-focused attention as a predictor of the course of depression. Moreover, our findings extend previous work in this field by adopting an unobtrusive approach of non-reactive assessment, capturing naturally occurring differences in self-focused attention. We discuss possible clinical applications of language-based assessments and interventions with regard to self-focus. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE: Naturally occurring individual differences in first-person singular pronoun use provide an unobtrusive way to assess patients' automatic self-focused attention. Frequent use of first-person singular pronouns predicts an unfavourable course of depression.

1055,'Can you look me in the face?' Short-term SSRI administration reverts avoidant ocular face exploration in subjects at risk for psychopathology,,"Anxiety and depression are associated with altered ocular exploration of facial stimuli, which could have a role in the misinterpretation of ambiguous emotional stimuli. However, it is unknown whether a similar pattern is seen in individuals at risk for psychopathology and whether this can be modified by pharmacological interventions used in these disorders. In Study 1, eye gaze movement during face discrimination was compared in volunteers with high vs low neuroticism scores on the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire. Facial stimuli either displayed a neutral, happy, or fearful expression. In Study 2, volunteers with high neuroticism were randomized in a double-blind design to receive the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram (20 mg) or placebo for 7 days. On the last day of treatment, eye gaze movement during face presentation and the recognition of different emotional expressions was assessed. In Study 1, highly neurotic volunteers showed reduced eye gaze towards the eyes vs mouth region of the face compared with low neurotic volunteers. In Study 2, citalopram increased gaze maintenance over the face stimuli compared with placebo and enhanced recognition of positive vs negative facial expressions. Longer ocular exploration of happy faces correlated positively with recognition of positive emotions. Individuals at risk for psychopathology presented an avoidant pattern of ocular exploration of faces. Short-term SSRI administration reversed this bias before any mood or anxiety changes. This treatment effect may improve the capacity to scan social stimuli and contribute to the remediation of clinical symptoms related to interpersonal difficulties.",2014.0,10.1038/npp.2014.159,XFIQI5E2,0,personality,1056
1056,"Background emotions, proximity and distributed emotion regulation.","Varga, Somogy; Krueger, Joel","In this paper, we draw on developmental findings to provide a nuanced understanding of background emotions, particularly those in depression. We demonstrate how they reflect our basic proximity (feeling of interpersonal connectedness) to others and defend both a phenomenological and a functional claim. First, we substantiate a conjecture by Fonagy \& Target (International Journal of Psychoanalysis 88(4):917-937, 2007) that an important phenomenological aspect of depression is the experiential recreation of the infantile loss of proximity to significant others. Second, we argue that proximity has a particular cognitive function that allows individuals to morph into a cohesive dyadic system able to carry out distributed emotion regulation.We show that elevated levels of psychological suffering connected to depressive background emotions may be explained not only in terms of a psychological loss, but also as the felt inability to enter into dyadic regulatory relations with others-an experiential constraint that decreases the individual's ability to adapt to demanding situations.

Furthermore, IPV survivors have also often experienced trauma in childhood. Consequently, by examining a sample of IPV survivors, this study sought to assess typical trauma sequelae--Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), or dissociative symptoms-and trauma-related characteristics consistent with Herman's Trauma theory (1992; i.e., chronicity of trauma, age of first trauma exposure, and social support), in relation to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function. The study compared basal and diurnal cortisol in women (n = 88) based on diagnostic status and symptom severity (PTSD [n = 14], PTSD and comorbid MDD [n = 43], subthreshold symptoms of PTSD and MDD [n = 19]), dissociative symptoms, and the aforementioned trauma-related characteristics to a matched control group (n = 12) without any lifetime history of mental health diagnoses or exposure to interpersonal trauma. Regardless of their diagnostic status and trauma-related characteristics, trauma-exposed women had higher levels of dissociative symptoms relative to women in the control group, and these dissociative symptoms were inversely related to awakening cortisol levels. Findings suggest that low cortisol levels may not be a diagnostic marker, but instead may be associated with a dissociative coping style developed in the context of trauma exposure, consistent with mechanisms posited by Trauma theory.",2013.0,10.1521/pdps.2013.41.2.247,CAI9X3ST,0,cognitive_additional,1058

Design: Clinical cohort study. Setting: University-affiliated hospital. Participants: Sixty outpatients (age 59 years and older) completed 12 weeks of CBT between July 2010 and December 2011. Forty-four completed fMRI procedures. Measurements: The main outcome consisted of a conversion from a clinical diagnosis (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview) of depression to no clinical diagnosis of depression or a significant improvement in diagnostic criteria. Brain activation measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging during the Wisconsin Card Sorting task (WCST) was the primary predictor variable. Results: 67 \% of patients had a positive response to CBT. Decreased activation in the left inferior frontal triangle and right superior frontal gyrus as well as increased activity in the right middle frontal gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus predicted a positive response to CBT. Demographic and neurocognitive measures of WCST performance were not significant predictors of a positive CBT outcome, whereas the measure of WCST-induced activity in the prefrontal cortex was a significant predictor. Conclusions: These data are among the first to suggest that measures of prefrontal brain activation during executive functioning predict response to CBT in older adults. Further exploration of the specific underlying processes that these prefrontal cortical regions are engaging that contributes to better CBT outcomes is warranted in larger, randomized studies.

Recently, oxidative stress and inflammation have been shown to contribute to the loss of muscle strength, and although melatonin has antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, the association between melatonin secretion and muscle strength remains unclear. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study of 760 community-based elderly individuals (mean age, 71.0 years), we measured overnight urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin excretion (UME) and grip strength and quadriceps strength. RESULTS: Median UME was 7.0 mug (interquartile range, 4.2-11.1), and mean grip and quadriceps strength were 27.5+/-8.4kg and 162.6+/-80.1 Nm, respectively. On dividing participants into quartiles by their UME level (lowest-highest UME, Q1-Q4), higher quartiles were significantly associated with increased grip strength and quadriceps strength (p for trend \textless .001, both). Multivariable analyses adjusted for potential confounders (age, gender, body mass index, smoking and drinking statuses, renal function, hypertension, diabetes, physical activity, depressed mood, cognitive impairment, bedtime, sleep duration, and day length) revealed that both grip and quadriceps strength were significantly increased in Q4 compared with that in Q1 (adjusted mean difference, Q4 - Q1: grip strength, 1.5kg; 95 \% confidence interval [CI], 0.4-2.6kg; p = .006; quadriceps strength, 14.2 Nm; 95 \% CI, 1.3-27.1 Nm; p = .031).

T.","Although most older adults report one or more symptoms of a chronic health problem, little attention has been paid to the report of these symptoms over time and whether different symptom patterns affect well-being and symptom management in community-dwelling elders. Therefore, this study examined whether community-dwelling older adults in Ohio, U.S.A. who experience consistently recurring (a) arthritis or (b) cardiopulmonary symptoms report more depression and worse self-assessed health and show more symptom management than those who report inconsistent symptoms and if there are differences in well-being and symptom management over time. This secondary analysis used longitudinal data collected from a random sample of 387 older adults who reported their health complaints in four interviews over 27 months time. Subjects were included in this analysis if they reported either arthritis (n = 321) or cardiopulmonary (n = 232) symptoms at one or more times during 27 months, and then were classified as having either consistent (occurring at all four time points) or intermittent/inconsistent (occurring at three or fewer time points) symptoms. Data analysis included t-tests, chi-square tests, and Repeated Measures ANOVA. Results indicate that those with consistent symptoms reported greater depression and worse self-assessed health than those with less consistent symptoms. Specifically, those with consistent cardiopulmonary symptoms became more depressed over time. Those with consistent cardiopulmonary complaints were more likely than those with an inconsistent pattern to use an illness label to describe their symptoms. Those with consistent arthritis symptoms tended to use more self-care at all time points, to label their symptoms as an illness, and were more likely to consult a physician as their symptoms persisted.

METHODS: One hundred and two patients discharged from hospital with unipolar depression were followed up 18 months later and were interviewed in detail regarding aftercare and treatment received. Unmet needs were assessed on the community version of the MRC Needs for Care Assessment. RESULTS: In the first month after discharge approximately 70 \% of subjects received contacts with mental health services and in the first 3 months over 80 \% received at least one contact. About 40 \% were in contact with mental health services at 18 months. Needs assessment found comparatively low unmet needs, reaching highest levels (around 25 \% in any 6-month period) for medication. Two-thirds of unmet needs for medication and psychotherapy were due to patient refusal or non-compliance. Aftercare levels were higher in those with more previous admissions and were unrelated to presence of personality disorder. CONCLUSIONS: There were some deficiencies in service aftercare for depressed patients in a British NHS setting, although unmet need was not high.

We suggest that activation of the physiologic stress response (PSR) from chronic exposure to stressors, low socioeconomic status (SES), severe mental health problems, or aggressive behavior increases the risk of T2D. This article is a comprehensive review of the literature on the link between T2D and psychosocial factors focusing on prospective studies of the risk for developing diabetes. The review found an increased risk for T2D in people: exposed to stressful working conditions or traumatic events; with depression; with personality traits or mental health problems that put them in conflict with others; of low SES, either currently or in childhood; and in racial/ethnic minority populations, independent of current SES. This review suggests that T2D prevention research would be more effective if (a) the PSR to psychosocial factors (especially social disparities) was recognized and (b) intervention programs evaluated reduction in social disparities as part of a comprehensive approach.

The two treatment groups were run in parallel. Special attention was paid to constipation, nausea/vomiting, drowsiness and respiratory depression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 131 enrolled patients started the 4-week treatment at low doses of opioid (25 microg/h TTS-fentanyl for 3 days or 30 mg SRM every 12 h) and were individually titrated. Tolerability, efficacy and safety were assessed throughout the study period. Frequency of constipation was the primary study variable and accordingly the study was powered for this. Both patients and investigators made a global treatment evaluation. RESULTS: TTS-fentanyl and SRM were shown to be equally effective. Pain control and sleep quality improved with both treatments. None of the patients developed respiratory depression. Statistically significantly more patients in the SRM treatment group discontinued the trial prematurely (59% vs 27%; p < 0.001), particularly due to adverse events (36% vs 4%; p < 0.001). Fewer patients in the TTS-fentanyl than in the SRM treatment group reported constipation during the trial. This finding was statistically significant after 1 week of treatment (27% vs 57%; p = 0.003). The favourable tolerability profile of TTS-fentanyl was also reflected in both the patient and the investigator global evaluation of the treatment. Patient assessment favoured TTS-fentanyl treatment in terms of a significantly lower rate of troublesome side-effects ('quite a bit' to 'very much' troublesome side-effects in 14% vs 36% of patients; p = 0.003) and less interruption of daily activities (absence of any interruption of daily activities in 88% vs 63% of patients; p = 0.012). Investigators scored TTS-fentanyl as significantly better with respect to 'side-effects' (p = 0.039) and 'overall impression' (p = 0.013). Sub-analyses of opioid-naive users gave similar results.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients aged 18-65 years with a primary diagnosis of recurrent MDD, a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score >/=26 and a Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score >/=4 were randomized (1:1) to treatment with either vortioxetine or venlafaxine XR. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to Week 8 in MADRS total score (analysis of covariance [ANCOVA], full-analysis set [FAS], last observation carried forward [LOCF]), using a non-inferiority margin of +2.5 points. Pre-specified secondary endpoints included MADRS response and remission rates, anxiety symptoms (HAM-A), CGI, overall functioning (SDS), and health-related quality of life (Q-LES-Q). CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study (SOLUTION) has the www.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01571453. RESULTS: On the primary efficacy endpoint at Week 8, non-inferiority was established with a difference of -1.2 MADRS points in favor of vortioxetine (95% CI: -3.0 to 0.6). The MADRS total score decreased (improved) from 32.3 +/- 4.6 at baseline to 13.6 +/- 9.6 (vortioxetine: n = 209) and from 32.3 +/- 4.5 to 14.8 +/- 10.4 (venlafaxine XR: n = 215) (FAS, LOCF). At Week 8, the HAM-A and SDS total scores, CGI and Q-LES-Q scores, and response and remission rates demonstrated similar improvement for vortioxetine and venlafaxine XR, with remission rates (MADRS </=10) of 43.1% (vortioxetine) versus 41.4% (venlafaxine XR) (LOCF). Fewer vortioxetine than venlafaxine XR patients withdrew for any reason (18.0% versus 27.4%) or for adverse events (6.6% versus 13.7%). The most frequent adverse events (>/=5%) for both treatments were nausea, dizziness, headache, and dry mouth. In addition, accidental overdose, decreased appetite, constipation and insomnia were reported by (>/=5%) of patients treated with venlafaxine XR. LIMITATIONS: The inclusion and exclusion criteria may limit the generalizability of the study. Since patients with a history of lack of response to venlafaxine XR were excluded from this study, there is a selection bias in favor of venlafaxine XR. CONCLUSION: Vortioxetine was at least as efficacious as venlafaxine XR and was safe and better tolerated than venlafaxine XR.",2015.0,10.1185/03007995.2015.1014028,42WJTE66,0,diathesis,1067
1067,Understanding Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder in adolescence: A dimensional personality perspective,"Aelterman, N.; Decuyper, M. and","The validity of the Axis II Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) category and its position within the Cluster C personality disorder (PDs) section of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV, APA 2000) continues to be a source of much debate. The present study examines the associations between general and maladaptive personality traits and OCPD symptoms, prior to and after controlling for co-occurring PD variance, in a general population sample of 274 Flemish adolescents and further explores the incremental validity of two different maladaptive trait measures beyond general traits. The results demonstrate that the number of (general and maladaptive) personality-OCPD associations decreases after controlling for a general personality pathology factor, with the FFM factor Conscientiousness and its maladaptive counterpart Compulsivity as remaining correlates of OCPD. The findings further suggest to complement the general NEO-PI-R (Costa and McCrae 1992) scales with more maladaptive items to enable a more comprehensive description of personality pathology variance. Implications for understanding and assessing OCPD in the developmental context of adolescence are discussed. \ \textcopyright \ Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.",2010.0,,FKCG3Z7T,0,personality,1068

Method: Fifty-five women from the south of France area hospitalised or on bed rest for high-risk pregnancy completed five scales: the Edinburgh Post-Natal Depression Scale (EPDS), the High Risk Pregnancy Stress Scale (HRPSS), the Revised Prenatal Coping Inventory (NuCPI), the 'Questionnaire du Soutien Social Per \c c u' (QSSP), and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES). Results: The results show that over half of these women manifest symptoms characteristic of pre-natal depression and the entire sample showed high levels of anxiety symptoms. Predictive factors for depression included informational support and self-esteem; for anxiety, predictive factors were patient age and EPDS scores. Conclusion: This study underscores the importance of providing appropriate psychological support for women with high-risk pregnancies in order to avoid depressive disorders and any potential negative consequences on the perinatal period. \textcopyright 2012 Copyright Society for Reproductive and Infant Psychology.",2012.0,10.1080/02646838.2012.677020,DYRFHG7B,0,diathesis,1069

He had suffered an acute psychotic breakdown when he was nearing the age of seventy-two. Following the usual psychiatric treatments (electric shocks, etc.), he settled down to a chronic psychotic state characterized by depression, hypochondria, paranoid delusions, and attacks of insane rage. Nearly two years after the beginning of his overt illness, when no improvement occurred, and when the psychiatrists in Rhodesia, where he lived, gave a hopeless prognosis, his son, who resided in London, brought him for psycho-analytical treatment.

Low concentrations of toxin II (2-100 nM) evoked a dose-dependent positive inotropic effect in the three different heart muscle preparations investigated. Higher concentrations of toxin II produced toxic symptoms like contracture and arrhythmia in auricles and atria (about 25 nM). In isolated cat hearts high toxin II concentrations (about 160 nM) caused unusual toxic symptoms such as long periods of ventricular fibrillation alternating with periods of normal cardiac activity. In rat and guinea-pig auricles as well as in Langendorff hearts of guinea-pigs the extent and rate of the positive inotropic effect induced by toxin II depended on the extracellular calcium concentration (0.45 to 2.7 mM). Toxin II did not alter the heart rate in spontaneously beating isolated cat hearts.

However, early experience-related changes in the function of central visceral neural circuits that control stress responses have not been well characterized, particularly in humans. The paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), amygdala (Amyg) and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) form a core visceral stress-responsive circuit. The goal of this study is to examine how childhood emotional and physical abuse relates to adulthood stressor-evoked activity within these visceral brain regions. To evoke acute states of mental stress, participants (n = 155) performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-adapted versions of the multi-source interference task (MSIT) and the Stroop task with simultaneous monitoring of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate. Regression analyses revealed that childhood physical abuse correlated positively with stressor-evoked changes in MAP, and negatively with unbiased, a priori extractions of fMRI blood-oxygen level-dependent signal change values within the sgACC, BNST, PVN and Amyg (n = 138).

R. and","Purpose: Stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment, such as macrophages, play an active role in tumor growth and angiogenesis. However, little is known about relationships of biobehavioral factors with angiogenic cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) produced by stromal cells. This study examined distress, MMPs, and angiogenic cytokines in ovarian cancer patients and in vitro. Experimental Design: Patients suspected of ovarian cancer completed preoperative questionnaires. At surgery, 56 were confirmed to have epithelial ovarian cancer. Tumor samples were analyzed for macrophage (CD68+) and tumor cell levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, and vascular endothelial growth factor. In vitro stimulation of isolated macrophage cells by the stress hormones norepinephrine and cortisol was done to assess effects on MMP-9. Results: Depressed patients showed significant elevations of MMP-9 in CD68+ cells, adjusting for stage (P \textless 0.0001). Patients with higher levels of current stress (P = 0.01), life stress over the last 6 months (P = 0.004), and general negative affect (P = 0.007) also showed significantly greater MMP-9 in CD68 + cells. In contrast, higher social support was associated with lower levels of MMP-9 (P = 0.023) and vascular endothelial growth factor (P = 0.036) in tumor cells. In vitro analyses showed that macrophage MMP-9 production could be directly enhanced (up to a 2-fold increase) by the stress hormones norepinephrine and cortisol. Conclusions: Ovarian cancer patients with elevated depressive symptoms, chronic stress, and lowsocial support showed elevations in MMP-9 in tumor-associated macrophages. Direct in vitro enhancement of stromal MMP-9 production by stress hormones was also shown. These findings may have implications for patient outcomes in ovarian cancer. \textcopyright 2008 American Association for Cancer Research.",2008.0,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-0230,VWVMZLSF,0,diathesis,1073

M.; Schneider, B.; Bureau, A.; Turecki, G.","Altered stress reactivity is considered to be a risk factor for both major depressive disorder and suicidal behavior. The authors have sought to expand their previous findings implicating altered expression of spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1 (SAT1), the rate-limiting enzyme involved in catabolism of the polyamines spermidine and spermine in the polyamine stress response (PSR), across multiple brain regions between control individuals and depressed individuals who have died by suicide. Microarray expression of probesets annotated to SAT1 were examined across 17 brain regions in 13 controls and 26 individuals who have died by suicide (16 with a diagnosis of major depression and 10 without), all of French-Canadian origin. Profiling conducted on the Affymetrix U133A/B chipset was further examined on a second chipset (U133 Plus 2.0) using RT-PCR, and analyzed in a second, independent sample. A reduction in SAT1 expression identified through multiple probesets was observed across 12 cortical regions in depressed individuals who have died by suicide compared with controls. Of these, five cortical regions showed statistically significant reductionswhich were supported by RT-PCR and analysis on the additional chipset. SAT1 cortical expression levels were also found to be significantly lower in an independent sample of German subjects with major depression who died by suicide in comparison with controls. These findings suggest that downregulation of SAT1 expression may play a role in depression and suicidality, possibly by impeding the normal PSR program or through compensation for the increased polyamine metabolism accompanying the psychological distress associated with depressive disorders. \textcopyright 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",2009.0,10.1002/ajmg.b.30920,C8GE42IF,0,diathesis,1075

Methods: Five hundred and eleven adolescents aged 12-17 (high-school students from two rural Israeli schools) completed self-report questionnaires consisting of the following measures: peer rejection (PR; ranged from having been ignored, cursed, assaulted, bullied, to having been physically attacked), posttraumatic symptoms (PTS), social avoidance, depression symptoms, potency and perceived social support. Results: Thirty-five percent of the students reported experiencing some kind of social rejection (SR). One-way ANOVA and stepwise linear regression tests showed that those who experienced SR had higher levels of depression, PTS symptoms, and social avoidance compared to those who had no such history. In addition, personal resources, potency in particular was found to mediate the distress. Conclusions: Findings indicated that adolescents who reported experiencing peer rejection had higher levels of psychological distress. In addition, the lower the personal resources were, the higher the levels of psychological distress. Potency buffered the level of distress resulting from social rejection by peers.

Beckman and H. E. Richter, 1972), a personality inventory based on psychoanalytic principles. Results show that patients saw themselves more depressive and more retentive (loss of communication) at the time of their illness as compared with themselves prior to their illness or with control individuals. Nurses saw their patients socially less resonant, more aggressive, and less controlled than patients saw themselves. Items related to the patients' depression were answered in the same direction by both nurse and patient. The personality profile of the ideal patient as projected by patient and by nurse did not differ to any major extent; patients wished they could be more submissive than they actually felt. They thus adapted to nurses' expectations. The personality profiles of nurses, as seen by themselves, differed significantly from those of control individuals; nurses experienced themselves as being socially less resonant, dominant, depressive, retentive, and lacking self-control. The ideal nurse as projected by the nurses themselves was less aggressive, less depressive, socially more resonant, and exhibited more self-control. The ideal nurse as projected by the patient had a personality profile that did not differ much from that of a normal individual.

1077,"The association among neuropsychological functioning, response styles, cognitive content, and the severity of depression in people diagnosed with end-stage liver disease evaluated for a liver transplant: A structural equation model.","Zolnikov, Bryan J.","Significance. The presence of a clinically significant depressed mood in people diagnosed with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) is a factor contributing to premature mortality. To date, investigations concerning potent and modifiable predictors of depression among people diagnosed with ESLD awaiting a liver transplant are scant. Investigations in non-medically ill people suggest that ruminative and problem-solving coping styles predict the onset and maintenance of depression over time (Response Styles Theory; Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991). In light of these findings, the current study evaluates the fit of a structural equation model (SEM) that incorporates neuropsychological functioning, response styles, and dysfunctional attitudes as correlates of the severity of depression. Method. Two independent samples comprised of 119 people diagnosed with ESLD evaluated for a liver transplant and 45 people diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) were drawn from the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Results. Fit indices for the ESLD and MS samples suggest that the overall fit of the models were good. Conclusions. Results from the SEM suggest that decrements in neuropsychological functioning are associated with higher levels of ruminative coping and lower levels of problem-solving coping. In turn, higher levels of ruminative coping are associated with higher endorsement of dysfunctional attitudes and increased severity of depression, while lower levels of problem-solving coping are associated with increased severity of depression. These findings shed light on neuropsychological impairments that restrict a person's ability to engage in adaptive coping and disengage from adaptive coping, and provide a theoretical framework to understand the role of neuropsychological functioning in mood disturbance among people diagnosed with serious medical illnesses who are susceptible to neuropsychological compromise. This research goes beyond theoretical implications and into the applied realm of neuropsychological remediation and psychotherapy geared toward increasing neuropsychological functioning, and modifying cognitive content and coping styles respectively.

The title of this selection of psychoanalytically informed papers brings to mind the notion of geographical boundaries and cultural or racial diversity. In this manner it points towards one section of the book that indeed focuses on issues around migration, culture and society. In 2005 the Adult Section of the European Federation for Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy in the Public Sector held its fifth annual conference in Dresden. The editors have brought together the papers presented at this conference to offer a book with four subsections. Each contributor was encouraged to consider the topic in its broadest sense to include the many different ways in which psychoanalysts and psychoanalytic psychotherapists may be confronted with building bridges and establishing links as well as recognizing differences. It is, though, necessary to say that not all papers were of this standard and perhaps that reflects the conference beginnings. The paper on treatment resistant depression disappointed me but I found myself imagining how interesting the subsequent discussions may have been. The creativity, flexibility and honesty that allows for this kind of book to be written offers hope for the ongoing application of psychoanalysis in many different settings.

N.; Goldman, D.","Although the serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) contributes to depression and suicidality in a fashion modulated by environmental stress, 5-HTTLPR has been little examined in relation to suicidal behavior in substance dependence. Recently, a third functional allele of 5-HTTLPR was discovered enabling more of the interindividual variation in serotonin transporter expression to be predicted by genotype. We examined whether the 5-HTTLPR gene alone, or interacting with childhood trauma, was predictive of suicidal behavior in substance-dependent patients, a clinical population that is at high risk of suicide, as well as childhood trauma and other stress. We interviewed 306 abstinent male African-American substance-dependent patients about whether they had ever attempted suicide and administered the 34-item Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Patients and 132 male African-American controls were genotyped to determine the S, LG, and LA 5-HTTLPR alleles; some analyses grouped the S and L G alleles on the basis of equivalent function. The distribution of 5-HTTLPR genotypes did not differ between patients and controls, nor between suicide attempters and non-attempters. However, patients with low expression 5-HTTLPR genotypes and above-median CTQ scores were more likely to have attempted suicide. Logistic regression showed increasing risk of a suicide attempt with increasing reports of childhood trauma scores; in addition, this increase was exaggerated among those with low expression forms of the 5-HTTLPR genotype. Childhood trauma interacts with low expressing 5-HTTLPR genotypes to increase the risk of suicidal behavior among patients with substance dependence. \textcopyright 2007 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.",2007.0,10.1038/sj.npp.1301331,PKQQHAGT,0,diathesis,1080

Aim: In this study we explore the relationship between environmental stress during pregnancy and psychotic experiences in children in the general population at 12. years. Methods: We analysed a birth cohort of 5038 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Environmental stress was measured as life event exposure. Data on life events were collected on women during their pregnancy, whilst psychotic experiences in the offspring were assessed at age 12. Results: There was a weak association between maternal exposure to life events and psychotic experiences at twelve years (crude OR 1.10 95 \% CI 1.02-1.18) per quartile of life event score. This association was not reduced after adjustment for socio-economic status, family history of schizophrenia, maternal education or birth weight but after adjustment for maternal anxiety and depression and smoking in early pregnancy there was no longer any evidence for an association (OR 1.01 95 \% CI 0.93-1.10).

A.; Sozu, T.; Imai, H.; Kawakami, N.; Horikoshi, M.","BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) usually involves homework, the completion of which is a known predictor of a positive outcome. The aim of the present study was to examine the session-by-session relationships between enthusiasm to complete the homework and the improvement of psychological distress in depressed people through the course of therapy. METHODS: Working people with subthreshold depression were recruited to participate in the telephone CBT (tCBT) program with demonstrated effectiveness. Their enthusiasm for homework was enhanced with motivational interviewing techniques and was measured by asking two questions: How strongly do you feel you want to do this homework? and How confident do you feel you can actually accomplish this homework? at the end of each session. The outcome was the K6 score, which was administered at the start of each session. The K6 is an index of psychological distress including depression and anxiety. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to elucidate the relationships between enthusiasm and the K6 scores from session to session. RESULTS: The best fitting model suggested that, throughout the course of behavior therapy (BT), enthusiasm to complete the homework was negatively correlated with the K6 scores for the subsequent session, while the K6 score measured at the beginning of the session did not influence the enthusiasm to complete the homeworks assigned for that session. CONCLUSIONS: Empirical data now support the practitioners of BT when they try to enhance their patient's enthusiasm for homework regardless of the participant's distress, which then would lead to a reduction in distress in the subsequent week.

Our purpose was to investigate the effect of COMT Val158Met on personality traits from adolescence to young adulthood in a population representative Caucasian birth cohort. Also its association with educational attainment and anxiety and mood disorders by the age 25 were examined. This analysis is based on the older cohort of the Estonian Children Personality Behavior and Health Study (original number of subjects 593). The personality traits were assessed when the participants were 15, 18 and 25 years old. COMT Val158Met had an effect on Neuroticism in females by age 25 (p=0.001, Bonferroni-corrected for five traits), whereas female Val homozygotes scored the highest.

Method: A total of 80 adolescents (85 female) consecutively presenting to mental health services with self-harm and comorbid depression were randomly allocated to either MBT-A or TAU. Adolescents were assessed for self-harm, risk-taking and mood at baseline and at 3-monthly intervals until 12 months. Their attachment style, mentalization ability and borderline personality disorder (BPD) features were also assessed at baseline and at the end of the 12-month treatment. Results: MBT-A was more effective than TAU in reducing self-harm and depression. This superiority was explained by improved mentalization and reduced attachment avoidance and reflected improvement in emergent BPD symptoms and traits.

Self-report measures of resilience-ie, the ability to adapt and thrive in the face of adversity-may identify those depressed older adults with more favorable prognoses. Methods We investigated the utility of baseline variables including 4 factors of resilience (grit, active coping self-efficacy, accommodative coping self-efficacy, and spirituality) for predicting treatment response and remission in a 16-week randomized controlled trial of methylphenidate, citalopram, or their combination in 143 adults over the age of 60 with MDD. Results Final logistic regression models revealed that greater total baseline resilience (Wald chi2 = 3.8, P = 0.05) significantly predicted both treatment response and remission. Specifically, a 20% increase in total resilience predicted nearly 2 times greater likelihood of remission (OR = 1.98, 95% CI = [1.01, 3.91]). Examining the individual factors of resilience, only accommodative coping self-efficacy (Wald chi2 = 3.7, P = 0.05; OR = 1.41 [1.00-2.01]) was significantly associated with remission. We found no relation between baseline sociodemographic factors (age, sex, race, education level) or measures of cognitive performance and posttreatment depressive symptoms. Conclusions Self-reported resilience may predict greater responsivity to antidepressant medication in older adults with MDD. Future research should investigate the potential for resilience training-and in particular, interventions designed to increase accommodative coping-to promote sustained remission of geriatric depression.

1086,Effects on children of treating their mothers' depression: Results of a 12-month follow-up.,"Coiro, Mary Jo; Riley, Anne; Broitman, Marina; Miranda, Jeanne","OBJECTIVE: This study used a controlled research design to examine the effects on children of treating their mothers' depression and of remission of the mothers' depression. METHOD: The sample consisted of 60 low-income women with major depression, who were predominantly from minority racial-ethnic groups, and their children ages four to 11. Women were randomly assigned to receive one of two active treatments (medication or cognitive-behavioral therapy) or a referral to existing community services. The mothers' depression was assessed by self-report on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and the children's symptoms and adaptive skills were assessed by their mothers at baseline and six-month and 12-month follow-ups with the Behavior Assessment System for Children. RESULTS: Mixed-effects random intercept and random slope repeated-measures analyses using an intent-to-treat approach indicated that active treatment of mothers did not result in improvement in their children's behavior problems or adaptive skills. However, at both the six- and the 12-month follow-ups, children of mothers whose depression had remitted, regardless of treatment assignment, had significantly fewer behavior problems than children whose mothers remained depressed. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the need to expand access to, and support participation in, depression treatment among low-income women from minority racial-ethnic groups. Although treatment alone of this undertreated population was not associated with improvement in children's outcomes, it is a necessary first step to prevent psychopathology among offspring of depressed parents.",2012.0,10.1176/appi.ps.201100126,96FQ65IN,0,behavior,1087

T.; Brewer, W.; Soulsby, B.; Desmond, P.; McGorry, P. D.; Pantelis, C.","Background: Grey matter changes have been described in individuals who are pre- and peri-psychotic, but it is unclear if these changes are accompanied by changes in white matter structures. Aims: To determine whether changes in white matter occur prior to and with the transition to psychosis in individuals who are pre-psychotic who had previously demonstrated grey matter reductions in frontotemporal regions. Method: We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine regional white matter volume in 75 people with prodromal symptoms. A subset of the original group (n=21) were rescanned at 12-18 months to determine white matter volume changes. Participants were retrospectively categorised according to whether they had or had not developed psychosis at follow-up. Results: Comparison of the baseline MRI data from these two subgroups revealed that individuals who later developed psychosis had larger volumes of white matter in the frontal lobe, particularly in the left hemisphere. Longitudinal comparison of data in individuals who developed psychosis revealed a reduction in white matter volume in the region of the left fronto-occipital fasciculus. Participants who had not developed psychosis showed no reductions in white matter volume but increases in a region subjacent to the right inferior parietal lobule. Discussion: The reduction in volume of white matter near the left fronto-occipital fasciculus may reflect a change in this tract in association with the onset of frank psychosis.",2008.0,10.1192/bjp.bp.107.043463,62DE2JY5,0,cognitive_additional,1088

Method: Multiple samples of saliva were collected on 4 days from 61 parents (mean age = 60.07 years, SD = 10.01) of individuals with a SMI (bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and major depression; mean age = 32.46 years, SD = 10.57) and a comparison group of 321 parents (mean age = 58.09 years, SD = 12.88) of individuals without a SMI (mean age = 32.36; SD = 13.87). Saliva samples were assayed for the hormone cortisol and group differences in diurnal cortisol patterns and their association with daily stress severity were explored. Results: On days after elevated stress, a hypoactivation pattern of diurnal cortisol suggestive of chronic stress was evident for parents of individuals with a SMI. After more stressful days, cortisol levels increased less from waking to 30 min after waking and declined less from 30 min after waking to bedtime for parents of individuals with a SMI. Conclusions: The results of the current study add to a growing body of evidence that the long-term effects of parenting an adult with a disability has a biological impact on aging parents and support the need for family interventions across adulthood and into old age for parents of individuals with SMI.

1089,Confluence of depression and acute psychological stress among patients with stable coronary heart disease: Effects on myocardial perfusion,"Burg, M. M.; Meadows, J.; Shimbo, D.; Davidson, K. W.; Schwartz, J. E.; Soufer, R.","Background-Depression is prevalent in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients and increases risk for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) recurrence and mortality despite optimal medical care. The pathways underlying this risk remain elusive. Psychological stress (PS) can provoke impairment in myocardial perfusion and trigger ACS. A confluence of acute PS with depression might reveal coronary vascular mechanisms of risk. We tested whether depression increased risk for impaired myocardial perfusion during acute PS among patients with stable CHD. Methods and Results-Patients (N=146) completed the Beck Depression Inventory-I (BDI-I), a measure of depression linked to recurrent ACS and post-ACS mortality, and underwent single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging at rest and during acute PS. The likelihood of new/worsening impairment in myocardial perfusion from baseline to PS as a function of depression severity was tested. On the BDI-I, 41 patients scored in the normal range, 48 in the high normal range, and 57 in the depressed range previously linked to CHD prognosis. A BDI-I score in the depressed range was associated with a significantly greater likelihood of new/worsening impairment in myocardial perfusion from baseline to PS (odds ratio =2.89, 95 \% CI: 1.26 to 6.63, P=0.012). This remained significant in models controlling ACS recurrence/mortality risk factors and medications. There was no effect for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor medications. Conclusions-Depressed patients with CHD are particularly susceptible to impairment in myocardial perfusion during PS. The confluence of PS with depression may contribute to a better understanding of the depression-associated risk for ACS recurrence and mortality.",2014.0,10.1161/JAHA.114.000898,XB699FVI,0,diathesis,1090
1090,"Management of refractory irritable bowel syndrome and comorbid mental ill-health: Challenges, reflections and patient's perspective of life on the body-mind divide","Udo, I.; Gash, A.","This complex case illustrates how blurred the divide between body and mind can be. In a patient with refractory irritable bowel symptoms, the emergence of new social problems exacerbate both psychiatric (anxiety and depression) and physical symptoms. Treatment of the physical symptomatology consisted of acute hospital treatments initially and subsequent primary care consultations. Psychiatric treatment consists of psychopharmacological (venlafaxine and mirtazapine) and psychotherapeutic approaches (cognitive behavioural therapy initially, and clinical hypnosis). The objectives of psychiatric treatment were to stabilise symptoms, reduce hospital admissions and foster self-management. The gains of management are presented. Social difficulties encountered over the period of treatment were legal processes to gain custody of son, bereavement, financial difficulties occasioned by stoppage of welfare benefits and legal processes involved in welfare appeal. Importantly, the patient's perceptive of treatment and care is presented. Detrimental effects that current welfare reforms in the UK may have on health are highlighted. \ \textcopyright \ 2013 BMJ Publishing Group.",2013.0,,Q6IPIS6B,0,behavior,1091
1091,The formative evaluation of a curriculum designed to reduce subclinical eating disordered behavior in young girls.,"Schuman, Miriam Ruth","Given the prevalence of eating disturbances in increasingly younger women, many researchers have called for primary prevention targeting girls during middle school years. Therefore, a school-based curriculum for sixth grade girls, designed around the principles of empowerment and social learning theory was developed, implemented, and evaluated. The 16 session curriculum addresses young girls' extreme concern about body size, weight, and shape, and their dietary restraint and weight management efforts. Program aims are to reduce risk for problem eating by enhancing beliefs, attitudes, and practices conducive to normal female development and to increase knowledge, skills for, and practice of healthy dietary behaviors. The program was piloted in a pretest-posttest non-equivalent comparison group design. Impact assessment instruments included the Children's Eating Attitudes Test and a curriculum tailored questionnaire measuring program related pre- and post-knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Results from the chEAT showed that intervention group students showed improvement on the Dieting scale (F = 6.51, p \textless ). Results from the curriculum specific instrument showed that intervention group students showed improvement in diet and body related knowledge and skills (F = 24.54, p \textless 1); knowledge of the dietary change process (F = 4.80, p \textless ); attitudes to thinness and risky behaviors (F = 10.16, p \textless ); and social norms (F = 12.44, p \textless 1). Process evaluation indicated that teacher fidelity to the program was high as were student and teacher satisfaction. Program factors thought to be responsible for these results include an empowerment philosophy, emphasis on the affective domain, clear articulation of program goals, active involvement of students, and use of evaluation instruments sensitive to the pre-adolescent sub clinical eating disorder experience. These findings contrast with recent research suggesting the inadvisability of providing eating disord (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",1995.0,,SQBJILWG,0,behavior,1092
1092,Novel routes to bipolar disorder drug discovery.,"Hoertel, Nicolas; de Maricourt, Pierre; Gorwood, Philip","INTRODUCTION: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe and chronic medical condition typified by episodic recurrent mania (or hypomania) in addition to major depression. BD is associated with a number of negative outcomes including premature death, reduced quality of life and can also lead to other complications including impaired cognitive function. Unfortunately, the currently available pharmacological treatments for BD are insufficient for many with the condition. AREAS COVERED: This review focuses on known therapeutic targets of mood stabilizing drugs including: the glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), the phosphoinositide pathway and protein kinase C (PKC), the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and histone deacetylases (HDACs). This article also presents new promising therapeutic targets including: the glutamatergic pathway, mitochondrial modulators, neuropeptide-converting endopeptidases, the insulin transduction pathway, the purinergic system and the melatoninergic system. EXPERT OPINION: Challenges in improving methods and tools to generate, integrate and analyze high-dimensional data are required to allow opening novel routes to BD drug discovery. Through the application of systems biology approaches and the use of bioinformatical tools to integrate all omics data, it will be possible in the near future to gain deeper insights into pathophysiology of BD. This will in turn lead to the identification and exploitation of new potential therapeutic approaches.",2013.0,10.1517/17460441.2013.804057,4CGPYHG3,0,cognitive,1093

A. and","Background: Four constructs are encompassed by the term falls-related psychological concerns (FrPC); fear of falling (FOF), falls-related self-efficacy (FSe), balance confidence (BC) and outcome expectancy (OE). FrPC are associated with negative consequences including physical, psychological, and social. Identifying factors associated with FrPC could inform interventions to reduce these concerns. Methods: Sixty-two empirical papers relating to psychological factors associated with FrPC in community-dwelling older people (CDOP) were reviewed. Four levels of evidence were used when evaluating the literature: good, moderate, tentative, and none. Results: Evidence that anxiety predicted FOF, BC, and OE was tentative. Moderate evidence was found for anxiety predicting FSe. Good evidence was found for depression predicting FSe. Moderate evidence was found for depression predicting both FOF and BC. No evidence was found for depression predicting OE. Tentative evidence was found for FSe predicting depression. Good and moderate evidence was found for quality of life (QoL) being predicted by FOF and BC respectively. Tentative evidence was found for FSe predicting QoL. Moderate evidence was found for QoL predicting both FSe and BC. No evidence was found for QoL predicting FOF. Good and moderate evidence was found for activity avoidance/restriction (AA/AR) being predicted by FOF and FSe respectively. Tentative evidence was found for BC and OE predicting AA/AR, as well as for AA/AR predicting FOF. Moderate evidence for activity level (AL) predicting FOF was identified, however the evidence of this predicting FSe and BC was tentative. Evidence for FOF, FSe, and BC predicting AL was tentative as was evidence to suggest FOF predicted coping. Conclusions: Mixed evidence has been found for the association of psychological factors in association with FrPCs.

This between-group difference was not seen when age and level of education were controlled. In the LOD group, 47.5 \% (vs. 31.5 \% of the early-onset group [P=0.025]), scored below the cutoff for dementia. Age-at-onset status in a logistic regression model predicted MDRS category, and treatment of the depression had little effect on cognition.

M.; Su, T. P.","BACKGROUND: Clinical and animal studies have reported conflicting results regarding the effect of ketamine on cognitive function, although increasing evidence supports a rapid and sustained antidepressant effect of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine infusion for patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, the cognitive function before and after ketamine infusion was rarely investigated in patients with TRD. METHODS: A total of 71 adult patients with TRD were enrolled and randomized to 0.5-mg/kg ketamine, 0.2-mg/kg ketamine, or normal saline infusion groups. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at baseline and at different time points post ketamine infusion. Cognitive function was evaluated using working memory and go/no-go tasks at baseline, Day 3, and Day 14 post ketamine infusion. RESULTS: A single low dose of ketamine infusion did not impair the cognitive function of patients with TRD. The paired t test revealed that patients with TRD receiving 0.5mg/kg of ketamine infusion exhibited a slight improvement in sustained attention and response control measured using the go/no-go task at Day 14 post ketamine infusion. A significant association was also observed between depressive symptoms and cognitive function changes at Day 3 in the 0.5-mg/kg ketamine infusion group. DISCUSSION: A 0.5mg/kg dose of ketamine infusion was not harmful, but slightly beneficial, for the cognitive function of patients with TRD. Additional studies are necessary to elucidate the effects of repeated ketamine infusion on cognitive function.",2018.0,10.1016/j.jad.2018.07.033,HHK9PBTH,0,additional,1099

J.; Harris, S. E.; Isomets","Disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) has been associated with risk of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, major depression, autism and Asperger syndrome, but apart from in the original translocation family, true causal variants have yet to be confirmed. Here we report a harmonized association study for DISC1 in European cohorts of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. We identify regions of significant association, demonstrate allele frequency heterogeneity and provide preliminary evidence for modifying interplay between variants. Whereas no associations survived permutation analysis in the combined data set, significant corrected associations were observed for bipolar disorder at rs1538979 in the Finnish cohorts (uncorrected P0.00020; corrected P0.016; odds ratio2.7395 \% confidence interval (CI) 1.42-5.27) and at rs821577 in the London cohort (uncorrected P0.00070; corrected P0.040; odds ratio1.6495 \% CI 1.23-2.19). The rs821577 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) showed evidence for increased risk within the combined European cohorts (odds ratio1.2795 \% CI 1.07-1.51), even though significant corrected association was not detected (uncorrected P0.0058; corrected P0.28). After conditioning the European data set on the two risk alleles, reanalysis revealed a third significant SNP association (uncorrected P0.00050; corrected P0.025). This SNP showed evidence for interplay, either increasing or decreasing risk, dependent upon the presence or absence of rs1538979 or rs821577. These findings provide further support for the role of DISC1 in psychiatric illness and demonstrate the presence of locus heterogeneity, with the effect that clinically relevant genetic variants may go undetected by standard analysis of combined cohorts. \textcopyright 2009 Nature Publishing Group.",2009.0,,MXTSNSBN,0,behavior,1100
1100,Problem-solving ability and comorbid personality disorders in depressed outpatients.,"Harley, Rebecca; Petersen, Timothy; Scalia, Margaret; Papakostas, George I.; Farabaugh, Amy; Fava, Maurizio","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with poor problem-solving abilities. In addition, certain personality disorders (PDs) that are common among patients with MDD are also associated with limited problem-solving skills. Attempts to understand the relationship between PDs and problem solving can be complicated by the presence of acute MDD. Our objective in this study was to investigate the relationships between PDs, problem-solving skills, and response to treatment among outpatients with MDD. We enrolled 312 outpatients with MDD in an open, fixed-dose, 8-week fluoxetine trial. PD diagnoses were ascertained via structured clinical interview before and after fluoxetine treatment. Subjects completed the Problem-Solving Inventory (PSI) at both time points. We used analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) to assess relationships between PD diagnoses and PSI scores prior to treatment. Subjects were divided into three groups: those with PD diagnoses that remained stable after fluoxetine treatment (N = 91), those who no longer met PD criteria after fluoxetine treatment (N = 119), and those who did not meet criteria for a PD at any time point in the study (N = 95). We used multiple chi2 analyses to compare rates of MDD response and remission between the three PD groups. ANCOVA was also used to compare posttreatment PSI scores between PD groups. Prior to fluoxetine treatment, patients with avoidant, dependent, narcissistic, and borderline PDs reported significantly worse problem-solving ability than did patients without any PDs. Only subjects with dependent PD remained associated with poorer baseline problem-solving reports after the effects of baseline depression severity were controlled. Patients with stable PD diagnoses had significantly lower rates of MDD remission. Across PD groups, problem solving improved as MDD improved. No significant differences in posttreatment problem-solving were found between PD groups after controlling for baseline depression severity, baseline PSI score, and response to treatment. Treatment with fluoxetine is less likely to lead to remission of MDD in patients with stable PDs. More study is needed to investigate causal links between PDs, problem solving, and MDD treatment response.

Aims: The aims were to determine whether the interpersonal constructs proposed to underpin interpersonal psychotherapy do indeed change in response to this therapy and whether such changes are associated with changes in depression in young people. Method: Thirty-nine adolescents, aged 13-19 years, with a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder, were randomly assigned in blocks to group or individual treatment. Assessments were conducted at pre and posttreatment, and 12-month follow-up. Results: The results supported the hypotheses, with significant improvements in social skills, social functioning, and the quality of parent-adolescent relationships, and an increase in secure attachment style and decrease in insecure attachment style being evident following treatment. Benefits were maintained at 12-month follow-up. Adolescents who showed greater reductions in depressive symptoms over this period tended to also show greater improvement in parent reported social skills, quality of the parent-adolescent relationship, and attachment style from pretreatment to 12-month follow-up. Conclusions: The findings are consistent with the proposed underpinnings of interpersonal psychotherapy. Adolescents showed significant improvements in interpersonal functioning and changes in attachment style following treatment, and changes in social skills, parent-adolescent conflict and attachment style were associated with reductions in depression. As such, the results add to the body of knowledge regarding the construct validity of interpersonal psychotherapy as an intervention for depression in young people.

F.","Background: Prenatal exposure to maternal psychological distress and glucocorticoids result in neurobiological adaptations within the fetus that increase risk for developing exaggerated emotional, behavioral, and stress responses to novelty and challenges in childhood. The current study investigated the influence of maternal depressed mood and cortisol during pregnancy on infant cardiac vagal control (CVC) to standardized laboratory challenge tasks. Methods: The sample comprised 194 women and their infants. Maternal reports of depressed mood and salivary cortisol were assessed at 14 and 32 weeks gestational age. Linear regression was used to examine associations between maternal measures during early and late pregnancy, and infant CVC indexed via respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) at rest and in response to laboratory tasks designed to elicit frustration when infants were 6 months of age. It was hypothesized that maternal depressed mood and cortisol would be associated with lower basal RSA and smaller decreases in RSA from baseline to challenge. Results: A significant decrease in infant RSA from baseline to frustration tasks indicated that laboratory tasks elicited a reliable decrease in RSA from baseline to frustration among infants which is characterized by reduction in vagal efferent activity on the heart in response to challenge. Higher maternal cortisol, but not depressed mood, was associated with lower basal RSA and greater decrease in RSA from baseline to frustration. Associations between maternal cortisol and infant basal RSA were observed for both early and late pregnancy whereas the associations between prenatal cortisol and decrease in RSA from baseline to frustration were observed for early, but not late, pregnancy. Conclusions: Maternal cortisol during pregnancy was associated with infant CVC at 6-months of age. Such influences may have enduring impacts on the child and important implications for the development of physical and mental health outcomes.",2015.0,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.01.024,IQ7T8Y2K,0,diathesis,1103
1103,Large group didactic CBT classes for common mental health problems.,"White, Jim","This chapter describes delivery of cognitive behavior therapy techniques for mental health problems using the STEPS service in a class format to address mental health problems. Stress Control is a six-session, 90 minute, didactic cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) evening class. It teaches CBT skills for common mental health problems (CMHPs), such as depression, anxiety, panic, and sleep difficulties. Stress control is an integral part, and the most popular option, in the 'menu' based STEPS service. In keeping with the didactic, educational nature of the class, the 'therapist' becomes a 'teacher' and 'patients' become 'students'. The class is run in a community setting, is free, and is open to anyone over the age of 16. People can book a place in advance or simply turn up on the night of the class. The class aims to teach individuals to 'become their own therapists'. Classes have been run for 6 to 160 people. The approach was devised by the author in 1986. Although developed through clinical experience, it fits well with more recent trans-diagnostic models, which address issues of co-morbidity and overlap between different disorders. 'Stress' equates well with Barlow et al.'s 'emotional disorders'. As it attempts to enhance mental health and wellbeing on a community-wide basis using the minimum level of intervention necessary to create the maximum gain, Stress Control fits well as a low intensity (LI) intervention. It attempts to marry a high quality service, providing appropriate help for each individual, with a high quantity service, providing help to large numbers. The class can be seen as a flexible self-help approach where the educational sessions guide the individual towards self-control skills and allows the student to work at their own pace. As part of the normalization message, stress is portrayed as part of everyday life. Hence the class aims to control not cure it. It can also be used to prevent the development of problems and prevent relapse. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",2010.0,,9H3M74XB,0,behavior,1104

METHODS: A nationally representative sample of girls and young women (n = 929) from three age cohorts completed a telephone interview assessing various personality, attitudinal, and behavioral characteristics. Respondents were categorized into four groups based on self-reported binge drinking and smoking (binge drinker/nonsmoker, smoker/non-binge drinker, binge drinker/smoker, or non-binge drinker/nonsmoker) and were assessed on a number of variables, including self-monitoring, depressive symptoms, coping style, religiosity/spirituality, popularity, dieting behavior, and smoking- and alcohol-related expectations. Univariate and multiple regression analyses were conducted to identify characteristics that best describe each of these types of substance users. RESULTS: Risk profiles varied across the groups. Girls and young women who binge drank but did not smoke were more likely to be high self-monitors, to engage in disordered dieting, and to believe drinking provided an excuse to act with less inhibition. Those who smoked but did not binge drink were more likely to report depressive symptoms. Those who binge drank and smoked were more likely to be popular and to report depressive symptoms. Certain forms of avoidant coping and low religiosity were associated with all three types of substance use. CONCLUSION: Understanding the risk profiles of girls and young women who engage in specific forms of substance use can facilitate the identification of those at risk and the development of more targeted and effective prevention programs and interventions.",2006.0,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2004.09.012,ERDHTCHL,0,personality,1106

1107,Abuse in childhood and psychopathic traits in a sample of violent offenders.,"Schimmenti, Adriano and","A significant body of research underlines the link between the exposure to abuse in childhood and subsequent criminal behaviors. Research on the role played by childhood interpersonal trauma in the development of psychopathy, however, is still scant. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between childhood experiences of abuse and psychopathic traits in a group of violent offenders from Italy. Seventy-eight inmates who were convicted of violent crimes participated in this study. Participants were administered the Traumatic Experience Checklist to assess childhood experiences of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, and the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) to assess psychopathic traits. Almost two thirds of the participants reported either emotional, physical, or sexual abuse in childhood, with 17 \% having experienced all 3 types of abuse investigated in this study. Emotional abuse resulted in a positive predictor of PCL-R total scores and its Interpersonal-Affective and Lifestyle-Antisocial factors. This suggests that emotional abuse in childhood, in combination with neurobiological and temperamental vulnerabilities, can foster the development of psychopathic traits.

1108,Negative mood regulation (NMR) expectancies: A test of incremental validity.,"Davis, Robert N.; Andresen, Elizabeth N.; Trosko, Michelle; Massman, Paul J.; Lovejoy, M. Christine","Negative mood regulation (NMR) expectancies are beliefs in one's ability to initiate behaviors to alleviate a negative mood or induce a positive mood. They are one of many cognitive factors that appear to contribute to individual differences in depressed mood. However, it remains unclear whether NMR expectancies predict depressed mood above and beyond related constructs, and whether they predict depressed mood over a time interval. We investigated the incremental validity of NMR expectancies in the prediction of depressed mood in a sample of 122 adults, 73 of whom were reassessed approximately one year later. At baseline, both NMR expectancies and negative affect (NA) accounted for non-overlapping variance in depressed mood. However, NMR expectancies were the only significant predictor of depressed mood at follow-up, even after controlling for NA and baseline depressed mood. These findings support the incremental validity of NMR expectancies as specific mechanisms involved in maintenance of depressed mood.

1109,Psychosocial correlates of pelvic floor disorders in women seeking bariatric surgery.,"Merrell, Julie; Brethauer, Stacy; Windover, Amy; Ashton, Kathleen; Heinberg, Leslie","BACKGROUND: Women who struggle with obesity are at a significant risk for pelvic floor disorders (PFDs), defined as urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, and/or fecal incontinence. The association between PFDs and reduced quality of life has been demonstrated; however, the psychosocial correlates of PFDs in women undergoing bariatric surgery have yet to be examined. The present study explored the potential psychosocial correlates of PFD. The setting was an academic medical center. METHODS: Data were analyzed from 421 female patients evaluated for bariatric surgery. Based upon a screening questionnaire, participants were dichotomized as women with PFDs (n = 121) and women without PFDs (n = 300). Patients completed the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, 2nd ed., Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF), and medical records were reviewed for demographic data, body mass index, substance abuse/dependence history, history of physical and/or sexual abuse, psychiatric medication usage, and psychiatric diagnoses. MMPI-2-RF scales measuring depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, and social support were examined. RESULTS: Women with PFDs were significantly older (F(1,420) = 3.87, P \ \textless \ .05) and more likely to evidence a history of substance abuse/dependence (chi-square = 4.53, P \ \textless \ .05) and depression (chi-square = 4.31, P \ \textless \ .05) than women without PFDs. There also was a trend for previous inpatient hospitalization (chi-square = 2.93, P \ \textless \ .09), outpatient behavioral health treatment (chi-square = 2.89, P \ \textless \ .09), and psychotropic medication usage (chi-square = 3.32, P \ \textless \ .07). No differences were found in the objective psychological testing. CONCLUSION: Women with PFDs may be more psychiatrically vulnerable than other bariatric surgery candidates. Additional research on the association among PFDs, substance abuse, and depression is warranted. Future research should consider whether this potential relationship changes postoperative bariatric surgery.",2012.0,10.1016/j.soard.2012.01.019,CCSRFAN5,0,personality,1110
1110,"Interactive models of depression vulnerability: The role of childhood trauma, dysfunctional attitudes, and coping.","Morris, Matthew C.; Kouros, Chrystyna D.; Fox, Kathryn R.; Rao, Uma; http://orcid.org/Morris","Objectives: This prospective study investigated whether within-individual relations between depression vulnerability factors (childhood trauma, dysfunctional attitudes, maladaptive coping) and depressive symptom trajectories varied as a function of the number of prior major depressive episodes (MDEs) experienced in their lifetime. Design Participants were 68 young adults who varied with regard to their history of depression; 32 were remitted depressed and 36 were never depressed. Methods: Depressive symptoms and disorders were assessed using semi-structured psychiatric interviews conducted twice over a 6-month period; interviews yielded weekly ratings of depressive symptoms during the follow-up interval. Childhood trauma, dysfunctional attitudes and coping were assessed with self-report measures. Data analyses were conducted using time-lagged multilevel models. Results: Individuals with more previous MDEs who reported greater childhood trauma exposure, more dysfunctional attitudes, or greater use of maladaptive coping strategies experienced more rapid increases in depressive symptoms during the follow-up period. A significant interaction of coping, number of previous MDEs, and time was found indicating that among individuals with less adaptive coping (i.e., lower primary or lower secondary control coping scores), depressive symptoms rating (DSR) increased significantly in relation to number of prior depressive episodes; no change in DSR was observed for never-depressed individuals. Among individuals with higher primary control coping scores, significant increases in DSR scores were observed for individuals with \textgreater 3 prior MDEs only. Conclusions: Findings highlight the need for treatment and prevention programmes that target stress reactivity and coping strategies early in the course of depression. Practitioner points Findings highlight the need to conduct multi-dimensional assessments of depression vulnerability that examine the interplay among risk factors over time. Relations between vulnerability factors (childhood trauma, dysfunctional attitudes, maladaptive coping) and depressive symptoms were stronger for individuals with more prior major depressive episodes (MDEs). Interventions for recurrent depression should focus on secondary control coping strategies that emphasize accommodation to stressful life events. Future studies should assess high-risk individuals before their first MDE to determine whether vulnerability factors linked with recurrence are pre-existing and relatively stable, or if they reflect 'scars' from MDEs.

We lack prospective studies that identify risk factors to be targeted in medical schools. Methods: From 1993 to 2008, graduating medical students (n=631) from all four Norwegian universities participated in the Longitudinal Study of Norwegian Medical Students and Doctors (NORDOC). After their graduating term (T1), they were followed up 1 (T2), 4 (T3), 10 (T4), and 15 (T5) years later with postal surveys. Severe depressive symptoms were measured by the General Health Questionnaire-28 (T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5) and analyzed by generalized estimating equations. Results: At T1 and T5, 13.7 \ \% \ and 7.2 \ \% \ , respectively, of the doctors reported severe depressive symptoms; a significant reduction over time (p=0.001) in both genders (response rates 56-83 \ \% \ ). Independent risk factors for future depressive symptoms were: young age (odds ratio [OR] 1.1, 95 \ \% \ confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.2, p=0.003); high neuroticism (OR 3.4, 95 \ \% \ CI 1.5-7.6, p=0.003); high reality weakness (OR 2.3, 95 \ \% \ CI 1.2-4.2, p=0.008); and severe depressive symptoms at T1 (OR 3.6, 95 \ \% \ CI 2.1-6.1, p \ \textless \ 0.001). Limitations: Selection bias and concurrent life and work stress may have influenced the results. Conclusions: In addition to low age, high neuroticism yielded a threefold increased risk over the 15-year follow-up, whereas high reality weakness, which is linked to personality pathology, doubled the risk. These factors are clinically relevant for identification of students at risk. \ \textcopyright \ 2012 Elsevier B.V.",2013.0,10.1016/j.jad.2012.08.047,I4Y9EIY6,0,personality,1112

The participants included 206 college students who were enrolled in summer courses. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesis that agency mediates the relationship between attachment avoidance and depression and that nurturance mediates the relationship between attachment anxiety and depression. Results confirmed the literature that both attachment avoidance and anxiety were positively related to depression and that agency was inversely correlated with depression. Attachment avoidance was not correlated with agency and nurturance was inversely correlated with depression. Gender moderated the relationship between attachment and depression. Results also suggested that agency partially mediated the relationship between attachment anxiety and depression, while attachment avoidance was partially mediated by nurturance.

K.; Hooten, W. M.","Objective: This study examined depression, pain catastrophizing, psychosocial functioning, and physical and emotional health attributes for geriatric patients admitted to an interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation center compared with middle and younger age groups. Design: Quasi-experimental time series. Setting. Interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation center at a tertiary referral medical center. Patients. In total, 411 patients with chronic non-cancer pain completed the pain rehabilitation program from October 2004 to April 2006. Patients were divided into three groups based on age: older (ages 60+; n = 78); middle-age (ages 40-59; n = 230) and younger (ages 18-39; n = 141). Intervention: A 3-week outpatient interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation program based on a cognitive-behavioral model that incorporates opioid withdrawal. Outcome Measures. The Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI), Short Form-36 Health Status Questionnaire (SF-36), Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), and Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) were administered at admission, discharge, and 6 months following treatment. The frequency of patients using opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and benzodiazepines at each assessment point were compared. Results. Older patients reported reduced depression, catastrophizing, pain severity, and pain interference (P \textless 0.001) at discharge and 6 months follow-up. Older patients also reported increased perceived control, and physical and social functioning at discharge and follow-up (P \textless 0.001). Improvement in older patients was comparable in magnitude to that of middle-age patients on all variables, whereas younger patients exhibited greater improvement on four variables. Significant reductions in analgesic use were observed in all groups. Conclusion. Interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation incorporating opioid withdrawal can improve long-term psychological, social and physical functioning for geriatric chronic pain patients.

1116,"Self-Efficacy for Managing Pain Is Associated With Disability, Depression, and Pain Coping Among Retirement Community Residents With Chronic Pain.","Turner, Judith A.; Ersek, Mary; Kemp, Carol","Little is known about cognitive and behavioral factors that influence older adults' adjustment to chronic pain. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship of self-efficacy for managing pain to reports of pain intensity, pain-related disability, depressive symptoms, and pain coping strategy use among 140 retirement community residents (88 \% female; age mean = 81.7, range 66-99 years) with chronic pain. The 8-item Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale, modified to specify pain rather than arthritis, demonstrated good psychometric characteristics (Cronbach alpha = .89, minimal floor and ceiling effects, and validity) in this sample. Controlling for age, gender, and pain intensity, self-efficacy was associated significantly and negatively with pain-related disability and depressive symptoms (P values \textless .001), and positively with use of pain coping strategies previously found to be associated with better outcomes (task persistence, exercise/stretch, coping self-statements, activity pacing; P values \textless .05). Self-efficacy for managing pain appears to be important in the adjustment of older adults with pain. Research is needed to determine whether interventions designed to increase self-efficacy improve quality of life and prevent functional declines in this population. Perspective: Among retirement community residents (mean age of 82 years) with chronic pain, higher self-efficacy for managing pain is associated with less disability and depression and with the use of pain coping strategies related to better adjustment. This suggests the potential value of interventions to increase self-efficacy in this population.

1117,"Attachment, mentalization, and reflective functioning.","Jurist, Elliot L.; Meehan, Kevin B.","Mentalization theory represents an important new contribution to the field of clinical psychology. It offers a developmental perspective on psychopathology and provides guidance in terms of technique and treatment, integrating ideas and research from psychoanalytic theory and attachment theory-two theories that originally were not regarded as compatible. Moreover, mentalization theory is grounded in ideas and debates from neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and philosophy, and thus ought to be recognized as a theory that is truly interdisciplinary in scope (Jurist, 2008). Although mentalization theory has primarily been applied to the treatment of borderline personality disorder (BPD), it has broader ramifications for treating other kinds of psychopathology and carrying out therapeutic interventions. The notion of mentalized affectivity is used here to support the case for the wide-ranging significance of mentalization theory. Mentalized affectivity is the capacity to reflect on the meaning of affective states-a capacity that is closely related to affect regulation, since it is fair to presume that trying to understand affects will help people to be able to modify how these are experienced. Although mentalized affectivity is a new concept, all forms of psychotherapy aim to expand it, whether implicitly or explicitly. In the first part of this chapter, we elaborate the issues described above by placing mentalization theory in the context of its roots in developmental research, neuroscience, and philosophy. In the second part of this chapter, we discuss recent research findings on reflective function (RF), the operationalization of mentalization, and the implications of both of these for our developing understanding of the concept. In the third part of this chapter, we discuss recent clinical applications of mentalization theory, using clinical examples and vignettes. In the conclusions, we consider some unresolved issues regarding mentalization that future study will need to address.

Dutch,"F, Jonghe; J, Dekker; S, Kool; G, Aalst; J, Peen and","BACKGROUND: Many clinicians are convinced that combined therapy (psychotherapy plus antidepressants) instead of farmacotherapy (antidepressants) is the treatment of choice for ambulatory patients suffering from depression. This view, however, is not supported by empirical evidence. AIM: To compare the acceptability, feasibility and efficacy of antidepressants with that of combined therapy (antidepressants plus psychotherapy) in the (ambulatory) treatment of depression. METHOD: The study in this article is a 6-month randomised clinical trial of antidepressants (n = 84) and combined therapy (n = 83) in ambulatory patients with major depression and a 17-item HDRS (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) baseline score of at least 14 points. The antidepressant protocol provides for three successive steps in case of intolerance or inefficacy: fluoxetine, amitriptyline and moclobemide. The combined therapy condition consists, in addition to pharmacotherapy, of 16 sessions of 'short psychodynamic supportive psychotherapy'. RESULTS: Acceptability of treatment: 32 \% of the patients refused after randomisation the proposed pharmacotherapy, while 13 \% refused the proposed combined therapy. Feasibility of treatment: in 24 weeks 40 \% of the patients started with the pharmacotherapy stopped medication, while 22 \% did so in the combined therapy condition. Efficacy of treatment: at week 24 the mean success rate was 41.2 \% in the pharmacotherapy group and 60,9 \% in the combined therapy group.

1121,Safety of pain control with morphine: New (and old) aspects of morphine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,"Coetzee, J. F.","Background: A 26-year-old, 59 kg female was administered morphine 10 mg during tonsillectomy, and 5 mg in the recovery room. She died 5 hours after the operation. Hypoxic cerebral injury, arising from morphine side-effects, was pronounced the cause of death, in spite of morphine being undetectable in blood. Recent pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling indicates that, after a single intravenous dose, maximum respiratory depression occurs after 1 hour and 40 minutes and persists for hours. Furthermore, respiratory depression is accompanied by airway obstruction, sleep potentiates respiratory depression and airway obstruction, pain stimulates breathing and antagonises respiratory depression, pain relief unmasks respiratory depression, and a slow breathing rate is uncommon. Methods: Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic simulations were used to estimate the time course of morphine effect-site concentrations in an average 59 kg female, and to calculate the degree of resulting respiratory depression. Results: Morphine effect-site concentrations approached dangerous levels for respiratory depression and persisted for hours, while plasma concentrations were undectectably low. Discussion: Court testimony indicates that additional factors contributed to the patient's demise. Respiratory depression was potentiated by pain relief following quinsy tonsillectomy, and by falling asleep. The airway was obstructed, as witnessed both by nurses and a fellow patient. In addition, nursing staff failed to recognise that snoring can indicate a dangerously obstructed airway. Conclusions: Dangerous respiratory depression often goes unrecognised in surgical wards. Strategies for improved safety include education of nursing and other staff regarding the following aspects of respiratory depression: (i) recognition of delayed and prolonged respiratory depression; (ii) noisy breathing indicates obstructed breathing; (iii) respiratory rate is an unreliable monitor of respiratory depression; (iv) training in airway management should be compulsory; (v) sleeping patients should be administered oxygen, and pulse oximetry monitoring should be done (especially at night); (vi) more local anaesthesia should be administered for postoperative pain; (vii) combination analgesic therapy (NSAIDs, paracetamol, ketamine, dexmedetomidine, gabapentin) should be utilised to reduce morphine requirements; (viii) high risk patients (e.g. elderly, obese, sleep-apnoea syndrome) should be identified; (ix) sedation scores should be recorded to detect obtunded patients.

Snyder highlights the relationship dynamics that so critically contribute to, and often exacerbate, sexual desire complaints. While acknowledging the value of psychological exploration of each partner's psychodynamic and developmental issues that may be thwarting sexual desire, Snyder suggests a more flexible approach-one in which a collaborative alliance between the partners is first achieved and the major couple conflicts are addressed before dealing with the sexual difficulties. He recommends a pluralistic affective reconstructive approach , wherein each partner becomes more aware of, and empathic to the other's emotional needs and struggles, so that better communication and greater receptivity-both emotional and sexual-can be achieved. Through the use of sample dialogue, Snyder illustrates how gently challenging and encouraging couples to reconsider how they speak to, and think about, each other paves the way for more effective communication and empathic responding. While an improvement in marital harmony and appreciation is achieved, the change in sexual desire is less dramatic. And, in truth, this is usually the outcome in most cases involving a sexual desire discrepancy-actual increases in sexual frequency are often modest despite greatly enhanced couple satisfaction.

D.","The Social Problem Solving Inventory-Revised Scale (SPSI-R) has been shown to be a reliable and valid self-report measure of social problem-solving abilities. In busy medical and rehabilitation settings, a brief and efficient screening version with psychometric properties similar to the SPSI-R would have numerous benefits including decreased patient and caregiver assessment burden and administration/scoring time. Thus, the aim of the current study was to identify items from the SPSI-R that would provide for a more efficient assessment of global social problem-solving abilities. This study consisted of three independent samples: 121 persons in low-vision rehabilitation (M age = 71 years old, SD = 15.53), 301 persons living with diabetes mellitus (M age = 58, and SD = 14.85), and 131 family caregivers of persons with severe disabilities (M age = 56 years old, SD = 12.15). All persons completed a version of the SPSI-R, Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). Using Rasch scaling of the SPSI-R short-form, we identified a subset of 10 items that reflected the five-component model of social problem solving. The 10 items were separately validated on the sample of persons living with diabetes mellitus and the sample of family caregivers of persons with severe disabilities. Results indicate that the efficient 10-item version, analyzed separately for all three samples, demonstrated good reliability and validity characteristics similar to the established SPSI-R short form. The 10-item version of the SPSI-R represents a brief, effective way in which clinicians and researchers in busy health care settings can quickly assess global problem-solving abilities and identify those persons at-risk for complicated adjustment.

METHOD: The CATCH-IT intervention model consists of primary care screening to assess risk, a primary care physician interview to encourage participation, and 14 online modules of Internet training to teach adolescents how to reduce behaviors that increase vulnerability to depressive disorders. Specifically, we evaluated this program from both a management/organizational behavioral perspective (provider attitudes and demonstrated competence) and a clinical outcomes perspective (depressed mood scores) using the RE-AIM model (Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance of the intervention). RESULTS: While results varied by clinic, overall, clinics demonstrated satisfactory reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of the CATCH-IT depression prevention program. Measures of program implementation and management predicted clinical outcomes at practices in exploratory analyses. CONCLUSION: Multidisciplinary approaches may be essential to evaluating the impact of complex interventions to prevent depression in community settings. Primary care physicians and nurses can use Internet-based programs to create a feasible and cost-effective model for the prevention of mental disorders in adolescents in primary care settings.

J.","OBJECTIVESThe myocardial recovery time following on-pump cardiac surgery remains uncertain. Global peak longitudinal strain is a sensitive measure of endocardial function which is most susceptible to ischaemia. We aimed to evaluate changes in global peak longitudinal strain up to 6 months after surgery and to compare initial changes with alterations in troponin T. Secondarily, we aimed to describe perioperative changes in strain of the inter-ventricular septum when compared with reference segments.METHODSPatients scheduled for coronary bypass, aortic valve replacement or combination procedures were enrolled. Echocardiography was performed on the day before surgery, the day after surgery, 4 days after surgery, 30 days after surgery and 6 months after surgery. Troponin T was measured 3, 16 and 24 h following procedure.RESULTSForty patients were enrolled and one was later excluded. Global peak longitudinal strain decreased from-14.5 ± 3.33 \% preoperatively to-9.98 ± 3.09 \% and-10.57 ± 3.16 \% on the first and fourth postoperative day, respectively. Global strain was still reduced on the 30th postoperative day, but had returned to preoperative values 6 months after surgery. Absolute values and relative changes in global strain did not correlate with postoperative peak troponin T measurements. Strain of the inter-ventricular septum was unaffected by surgery as opposed to reference segments, although septal displacement in the longitudinal direction decreased from 12.0 ± 3.75 mm preoperatively to 3.58 ± 4.22 mm 4 days after surgery.CONCLUSIONSGlobal peak longitudinal strain was reduced for at least 30 days after on-pump cardiac surgery and seems to represent a more sensitive marker of myocardial function than ejection fraction. The decrease in global strain was not reflected in troponin T measurements. The visual, echocardiographic impression of septal dysfunction may be a translational phenomenon, as septal strain was unaffected by surgery. \textcopyright 2012 The Author 2012.

Chlorpromazine served as a reference compound. Tr-10 expressed in general the pharmacological profiles as neuroleptic ascertained by anti-methamphetamine activity, supression of conditioned avoidance response, taming effects, decrease in exploratory behavior and cataleptogenic activity. Among these effects, anti-methamphetamine action was most potent. Different from chlorpromazine, TR-10 showed a similar pharmacological activity pattern in the intraperitoneal and oral routes of administration as depicted from ED50/LD50 values. Although the effects relevant to neuroleptics were less potent than chlorpromazine, such were seen with TR-10 at lower doses than those causing muscle relaxation. TR-10 significantly depressed the spontaneous motor activity but showed no anti-convulsant action in mice. Hypothermic action, potentiating effects of hypnotics and alpha-adrenergic blocking action, characteristic to chlorpromazine, were very weak for TR-10.

Idiosyncratic content and cognitive distortions.,"Beck, Aaron T.","Systematic errors in the logical or realistic thinking of 16 male and 34 female depressed patients between 18 and 48 years of age and treated in 1-6 weekly sessions over 1/2-6 yr. in psychotherapy or formal psychoanalysis by the author are presented and discussed. 31 nondepressed psychotherapy patients served as controls. The typical ideational content of the depressed patients was characterized by themes of low self-esteem, self-blame, overwhelming responsibilities, and desires to escape. Affective disturbances in depression are hypothesized to be secondary to or reciprocal with cognitive distortions resulting from the progressive dominance of the thought processes by idiosyncratic schemas.

K.; Wilson, B.; Stebbins, G. T.","Objective: Videotape assessments in psychogenic movement disorder patients (PMDs) following psychodynamic psychotherapy and continuing neurological observation using a clinimetrically tested videotape-based PMD scale (Hinson 2005). Background: We conducted a 6 month parallel design trial with PMD patients assigned to three months of either active psychotherapy or neurological observation in randomized order. Movements, depression and anxiety improved in both arms. In this report we compare the PMD rating scale from entry to end of the study. Design: A blinded investigator assessed videotapes using the PMD scale. Data were analyzed using Kolmogorov- Smirnov Z test for pre-post treatment video ratings. Results: Fourteen women and one man, age 42.3± 11, disease duration 63.2± 73 months, were randomized to immediate (7) or delayed (8) treatment. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for either visit 1 vs. visit 2 or visit 2 vs. visit 3 (minimum p = 0.28). Conclusion: In this group of PMD patients, movements, depression and anxiety improved, but there was no change in videotape assessments. Scale limitations in assessing longitudinal changes in paroxysmal PMDs may account for these results.",2012.0,,ICJQGNSZ,0,psychodynamic,1129
1129,Adolescent substance use and abuse prevention and treatment: Primary care strategies involving social networks and the geography of risk and protection,"Walker, L. R.; Mason, M.; Cheung, I.","The use and abuse of licit and illicit substances in adolescence is a national public health concern. This behavior impairs healthy development for many adolescents in the United States. Although not every adolescent who becomes a regular user of licit and illicit substances will develop a substance abuse disorder, all adolescents using these substances can experience a life-threatening outcome. Understanding the epidemiology and social profile of adolescent substance use, namely the risk and protective factors and the environmental and genetic factors, is essential to the development of strategies for prevention. There are many methods that can be employed to better assess environments in which adolescents live. The method discussed in this paper is descriptive and utilizes Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology. The primary goal of this paper is to illustrate and describe an analysis of substance using and non-substance using adolescents, their social networks, the risky and protective settings where they socialize, and the relationship of these variables to health outcomes such as substance use, depression, and stress. Published data from the researchers' recent investigation examine the effect of social network affiliations and geographical risk factors on drug involvement and illustrate how these factors may then be incorporated into prevention and intervention planning, especially in medical settings. \textcopyright Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.",2006.0,10.1007/s10880-006-9021-z,6PZJMEUX,0,diathesis,1130
1130,A study of treatment compliance following kidney transplantation.,"Kiley, D. J.; Lam, C. S.; Pollak, R.","Kidney transplantation is a successful treatment for end-stage renal disease. We studied demographic and psychosocial variables that relate to compliance behaviors following renal transplant. One hundred and five renal allograft recipients, with a minimum of 18 months follow-up, were studied. A biographical questionnaire, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale, and the Social Support Appraisals Questionnaire were used as measuring instruments. Specifically for this study, we designed a Health Belief Model Questionnaire, a Patient and Provider Relationship Questionnaire, a Compliance Self-Report Questionnaire, and a Self-Efficacy Questionnaire. Compliance was determined by cyclosporine whole blood levels \textgreater 30 ng/ml, maintenance of ideal body weight ( \textless 20 \% gain), and percentage of missed clinic visits ( \textless 20 \% ). Data was analyzed using discriminant analysis, Pearson's correlation, and chi-square. Four groups were identified, i.e., overall compliant (n = 25), noncompliant with diet (n = 29), noncompliant with medication (n = 27), and overall noncompliant (n = 29). No patient missed \textgreater 20 \% of clinic visits. Discriminant function analysis distinguished patients who were compliant from those who were not. Males were more likely to be noncompliant with medication, whereas females were more likely to be noncompliant with diet. Noncompliance was also associated with increased numbers of prescribed medications, depression, black race, locus of control attributed to powerful others, unemployment, as well as the perceived amount of social and family support. Patients with failed grafts (n = 14) were more depressed (P \textless 0.05), perceived less benefit from the treatment regimen (P \textless 0.01), and had less confidence in their care providers (P \textless 0.05) than those recipients of successful grafts (n = 91). In conclusion, this study identifies a number of psychosocial and demographic variables that impact on patient compliance behaviors after renal transplant. Interventional strategies to obviate noncompliance will need to consider these heterogeneous variables in order to maximize long-term renal allograft survival.",1993.0,,7UEGXIXL,0,behavior,1131
1131,Cognitive reactivity mediates the relationship between neuroticism and depression.,"Barnhofer, Thorsten; Chittka, Tobias","Although neuroticism has long been established as an important risk factor for depression, the mechanisms through which this temperamental predisposition translates into the occurrence of symptoms are still relatively unclear. This study investigated cognitive reactivity, i.e. the ease with which particular patterns of negative thinking are reactivated in response to mild low mood, as a potential mediator. Individuals with (N = 98) and without a previous history of depression (N = 83) who had provided neuroticism scores six years previously were assessed for cognitive reactivity and current symptoms of depression using self-report questionnaires. Tendencies to respond to mild low mood with ruminative thinking mediated the relation between neuroticism and current symptoms of depression in both groups. Reactivation of hopelessness and suicidal thinking occurred as an additional mediator only in those with a history of previous depression. The results suggest that neuroticism predisposes individuals to depression by generally increasing the likelihood of ruminative responses to low mood. In those with a history of depression in the past, neuroticism additionally increases risk of recurrence by facilitating reactivation of previously associated patterns such as suicidal thinking and hopelessness. These findings suggest potential targets for interventions to help preventing the occurrence, or recurrence of depression in those who due to their temperamental predisposition are at an increased risk.",2010.0,10.1016/j.brat.2009.12.005,5TSKLRGI,0,cognitive,1132

E.","From the subway driver's point of view, a 'person under train' (PUT) incident is a serious life event. This study focuses on the 1-yr consequences of such events. Follow-up was made 3 wk, 3 months and 1 yr after the event. 40 consecutive PUT subway drivers were followed. For each PUT driver, a control driver matched with regard to gender, age and country of birth was followed at identical intervals. Main results: the PUT group had significantly more sick days during the interval from the event to 3 wk later. During the period 3 wk to 3 months after the event no difference between the groups was observed. From 3 months to 1 yr after the PUT significantly more days were again reported by the PUT group. 38 \% in the PUT groups vs 14 \% in the control group had at least 1 month of sickness absence during this period. A mild acute psychophysiological reaction was observed 3 wk after the event, with elevated prolactin and increased sleep disturbance in the PUT group. Such acute reactions were transitory and not correlated with long-term sick leave, which was predicted independently, however, by a high plasma cortisol level (analysed in men) and a high depression score. Drivers in the group with seriously injured victims were absent from work for longer periods than drivers in the groups with mildly injured or dead victims. PUT victims described a successively worsened psychosocial work situation during the 12 months of follow-up whereas the drivers in the control group described an unchanged situation.",1994.0,10.1016/0277-9536(94)90449-9,JRLD4IBD,0,diathesis,1133

A.","Immune complex assays (and other immunologic tests) were performed on sera from 162 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and 275 AIDS-related subjects. Immune complexes were detected in 89 \% of AIDS patients and 93 \% of homosexual men with lymphadenopathy. Immune complex levels in AIDS patients were not associated with a particular risk group or with types of opportunistic infection or malignancy; however, they correlated with other laboratory features of the immune defect (depression in T helper cells and T helper/suppressor-cell ratio, and IgG levels). Immune complexes were also detected in a lesser proportion of risk-group controls (homosexual men, hemophiliacs, Haitians). In risk-group controls, immune complex levels were associated with certain features reflecting sexual practice, blood product exposure, or infection, but these features did not account for the higher levels found in AIDS patients. In appropriate situations, immune complex assays may be of value as screening tests or, possibly, as prognostic indicators for AIDS or AIDS-related syndromes.",1985.0,10.1007/BF00915011,S8X6QHZM,0,cognitive_additional,1134

S.; Wieck, A.; Argimon, I. I. L.; Bromberg, E.","Physical activity has been proposed as a promising intervention to improve cognition and decrease the risk of dementia in older adults. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) appears to mediate, at least partially, these effects of exercise. However, intervention studies of the effects of multimodal exercises on cognition and BDNF levels are scarce and composed by small samples. Thus, the generalization of the conclusions of these studies depends on the reproducibility of the results. In order to contribute to the knowledge on the field, the present study evaluated the effects of a physical activity intervention composed by muscle strengthening and aerobic conditioning on BDNF levels and cognition in older women. Independent and non-demented subjects (≥75 years) were assigned to a 3-month physical activity intervention (n = 22, 60 min exercise sessions three times a week) or to a control condition (n = 10, no exercise). Clinical (anxiety and depression symptoms), neuropsychological (Digit Span, Stroop, Trail Making, and Contextual Memory tests), physical (upper and lower limb strength, aerobic conditioning), and physiological (serum BDNF) parameters were evaluated immediately before, 1 month, and 3 months after starting intervention. Results indicated that controls had stable levels for all measured variables, whereas the intervention group improved on physical fitness, depressive symptoms, cognitive performance, and BDNF levels. Moreover, a linear regression identified an association between aerobic conditioning and BDNF levels. In conclusion, combined muscle strengthening and aerobic conditioning was able to improve cognitive performance and increase BDNF levels. Aerobic conditioning seems to be an important mediator of these outcomes.",2017.0,10.1007/s11357-017-9987-5,7ZXCMXDA,0,additional,1135

The questionnaire was completed by 199 children aged 9 to 16 years. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed five scales: eating in response to anger, anxiety, restlessness, helplessness, and depression. The EES-C showed good internal consistency and test-retest reliability, and it showed moderate relationships with measures of disordered-eating [Children's Eating Attitudes Test-26 (ChEAT-26), Questionnaire of Eating and Weight Patterns-Adolescent Version (QEWP-A)] and psychopathology (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children, Children's Depression Inventory, Child Behavior Checklist). There were significant differences between the BE/NED groups (with the OE group in the middle position) in desire to eat when Anger (the girls in BE group, and the oldest children in OE group obtaining higher scores) or Helplessness were present. Eating due to Depression was higher in the older groups. Multiple regression analysis conducted showed that anxiety-trait was the best predictor of emotional eating. Results support the potential utility of the EES-C in the study of emotional eating in children and its validity in the Spanish population.",2011.0,10.1080/15374416.2011.563468,GBEW8SRP,0,cognitive,1137

In this study, 163 patients with documented coronary artery disease (CAD) were interviewed for multiple indices of SI/A and administered the Symptom Checklist 90 - Revised (SCL90R). A spouse or friend provided an independent rating of ED using the spouse/friend version of the Ketterer Stress Symptom Frequency Checklist (KSSFC). The measures of ED and SI/A covaried. All three scales from the KSSFC (depression, anxiety, and AIAI - aggravation, irritation, anger, and impatience), and three scales from the SCL90R (anxiety, depression, and psychoticism), were associated with early Age at Initial Diagnosis (AAID) of CAD. Neither three scales derived from the SCL90R (shyness, feeling abused, and feeling lonely) nor the interview indices of SI/A (married, living alone, having a confidant, self description as a lone wolf, and self-description as lonely) were associated with early AAID. Thus, it is concluded that the present results indicate that ED and SI/A are confounded and that, even when tested head-to-head in a multivariate analysis, only ED is associated with AAID.",2011.0,10.1080/13548506.2010.534486,CNRIDESC,0,personality,1138

There have been reports about the possibility of forming psychoorganic disorders in opiate addiction. Currently, the main number of drugs used opioid is heroin, which combines a variety of highly toxic ingredients: strychnine, quinine, chlorine derivatives. The use of opium treated with acetic anhydride, promotes the formation of toxic encephalopathy with intellectual disabilities. Some authors deny the decline of intelligence in these patients and suggest that intelligence remains intact for a long time from the start of anesthesia. Because of narcotic destruction of the cerebral hemispheres are largely violated mental disorders, attention, psychomotor coordination, speech, gnosis, praxis, the bill, thinking, orientation, planning and control of mental activity. With long-term substance abuse appears fatigue, exhaustion of attention, lack of ability to concentrate, inability to intense mental activity. The patient becomes irritable, dysphoric, and evil. Develops overall emotional brutalization, deceit, lack of a sense of shame, they become indifferent; they do not care about losing a job or a family, and even their own health. Cerebrolysin - peptidergicnootropic drug has low molecular weight, biologically active neuropeptides, which overcome the blood-brain barrier and enter directly to the nerve cells. In particular, it reduces the concentration of lipid peroxidation products, which increased in heroin addiction. A very important aspect of the action cerebrolysin is that it shows a positive effect on cognitive function, improves concentration, the processes of memorizing and reproducing information associated with short-term memory, increases the ability to maintain skills that will intensify the process of mental activity, improves mood, promotes the formation of positive emotions, i.e. has a neuroprotective effect, acting as proof of cognitive impairment. Furthermore, it has such important characteristics as antiastenic, antidepressant and psychostimulant. Very important is the brain-specific adaptogenic effect Cerebrolysin associated with increased stability of the nerve cells to the damaging effects of different nature. Due to its properties Cerebrolysin found extremely wide application in the treatment of various cognitive disorders, including mnemonic arising from hypoxia, intoxication, and various degenerative diseases of the brain. The aim of the study was evaluation of cognitive disorders and neurotic disorders in Cerebrolysin therapy in patients with heroin addiction. The study involved 26 patients with heroin dependence during inpatient treatment, mean age 31.5 years, disease duration of 3.5 years, the daily dose of drugs used intravenously 0.5 g Patients were divided into study and control groups are not statistically different.

Prolactin and cortisol responses to D-fenfluramine challenge, clinical psychobehavioural changes, personality characteristics, including mood, aggressiveness and temperamental aspects, were evaluated 3 weeks after MDMA discontinuation. MDMA users had significantly reduced prolactin and cortisol responses in comparison with control individuals (p \ \textless \ 0.001 and p \ \textless \ 0.005, respectively). Dysphoria and mood changes were exhibited in seven individuals, tiredness in five and sensation-seeking behaviour in twelve at the clinical evaluation.

A.; Seeman, T. E.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of educational attainment with an array of risk factors for poor health among high-functioning older men and women. METHODS: Cross-sectional analyses of psychosocial, behavioral, and biological factors and educational attainment were conducted using data from a population-based cohort study of older men and women. Participants consisted of 70- to 79-year-old residents of communities of East Boston, MA; New Haven, CT; and Durham County, NC (N = 1192) participating in the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly programs, a three-site longitudinal study of community-dwelling men and women. Participants were selected on the basis of high physical and cognitive function, representing approximately the top third of their peers in terms of functional ability in 1988. In-home interviews were conducted. Associations among education and behavioral (e.g., cigarette smoking and physical activity), biological (e.g., pulmonary function, serum cholesterol), psychological (e.g., self-efficacy, anxiety), and social (e.g., networks and support) factors were examined. RESULTS: Low levels of education were associated with poorer psychological function (less mastery, efficacy, happiness), less optimal health behaviors (increased tobacco consumption and decreased levels of physical activity), poorer biological conditions (decreased pulmonary function, increased body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio), and larger social networks (increased number of contacts, decreased negative support). Several factors (alcohol consumption, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) were nonlinearly related to educational attainment. CONCLUSIONS: Educational attainment is associated with a broad array of psychosocial and biological conditions among the elderly. That an education gradient functions over an array of factors that structure daily life, even in later life in a healthy population, may suggest how socioeconomic status influences health.",1998.0,,EP7FWLY7,0,behavior,1141

Case series data and pilot trials suggest metacognitive therapy (MCT) is a promising treatment for anxiety and depression. Other research has found negative metacognitive beliefs and thought-control strategies may be involved in the development and maintenance of hallucinations and delusions. The potential of MCT in treating psychosis has yet to be investigated. AIMS: Our aim was to find out whether a short number of MCT sessions would be associated with clinically significant and sustained improvements in delusions, hallucinations, anxiety, depression and subjective recovery in patients with treatment-resistant long-standing psychosis. METHOD: Three consecutively referred patients, each with a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia and continuing symptoms, completed a series of multiple baseline assessments. Each then received between 11 and 13 sessions of MCT and completed regular assessments of progress, during therapy, post-therapy and at 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Two out of 3 participants achieved clinically significant reductions across a range of symptom-based outcomes at end-of-therapy. Improvement was sustained at 3-month follow-up for one participant. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using MCT with people with medication-resistant psychosis. MCT was acceptable to the participants and associated with meaningful change.

However, this association could be due to genetic factors influencing exposure to such risky environments or increasing sensitivity to the detrimental impact of abuse. Therefore, using a large epidemiological case-control sample, we explored the interplay between a specific form of childhood abuse and family psychiatric history (a proxy for genetic risk) in the onset of psychosis. METHODS: Data were available on 172 first presentation psychosis cases and 246 geographically matched controls from the Aetiology and Ethnicity of Schizophrenia and Other Psychoses study. Information on childhood abuse was obtained retrospectively using the Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse Questionnaire and occurrence of psychotic and affective disorders in first degree relatives with the Family Interview for Genetic Studies. RESULTS: Parental psychosis was more common among psychosis cases than unaffected controls (adjusted OR = 5.96, 95 \% CI: 2.09-17.01, P = .001). Parental psychosis was also associated with physical abuse from mothers in both cases (OR = 3.64, 95 \% CI: 1.06-12.51, P = .040) and controls (OR = 10.93, 95 \% CI: 1.03-115.90, P = .047), indicative of a gene-environment correlation. Nevertheless, adjusting for parental psychosis did not measurably impact on the abuse-psychosis association (adjusted OR = 3.31, 95 \% CI: 1.22-8.95, P = .018). No interactions were found between familial liability and maternal physical abuse in determining psychosis caseness. CONCLUSIONS: This study found no evidence that familial risk accounts for associations between childhood physical abuse and psychotic disorder nor that it substantially increases the odds of psychosis among individuals reporting abuse.",2014.0,10.1093/schbul/sbt201,Z2BTH4VP,0,diathesis,1143
1143,Psychotherapy in patients with coronary heart disease.,"Lingen, Christoph-Herrmann","In patients with coronary heart disease, psychosomatic-somatopsychic interactions are frequent and clinically relevant. Starting in the 1960s, psychosocial interventions have been used to improve the patient's well-being and disease outcomes. Besides educational and non-specific supportive interventions or relaxation trainings, more specific psychotherapeutic interventions have been reported. Many of these interventions aim at reducing distress and promoting healthy behaviors, thereby slowing down the disease process. More recently, studies have also been made on the psychotherapy for psychiatric comorbidities. In the largest psychotherapy trial in coronary patients, the ENRICHD trial, 2,481 post-myocardial infarction patients with depression or low perceived social support were randomized to receive up to six months of cognitive behavioral psychotherapy or treatment as usual. The treatment resulted in a marked reduction in depressive symptoms. However, given the high remission rate in the control group, the net treatment effect was modest. The targeted reduction in mortality was not achieved. The current state of the literature does not yet allow to give general evidence- based treatment recommendations. It rather requires the development of differential indications, the refinement of existing treatment concepts and the exploration of alternative psychotherapeutic methods. Individual treatment decisions must be based on the specific case, on the well-documented subjective benefits of psychotherapy in coronary patients as well as on theoretical assumptions about stress management and relaxation trainings and on general knowledge about the effectiveness of psychotherapy obtained in other patient groups. When working with coronary patients, psychotherapists should be aware of the cardiac condition and its typical precursors and consequences. They should also closely collaborate with the patients' cardiologists and family physicians. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",,,4X8998SP,0,cognitive,1144

K.; Colle, R.; Skeif, H.; Rotenberg, S.; Gressier, F.; Costemale-Lacoste, J. F.; Rigal, A.; Becquemont, L.; Corruble, E.; Ducreux, D.","Introduction: Brain structural connectome is a set of all neuronal connections; it reflects the brain neuronal communication capacity and computational power. Antidepressant drugs (AD) increase hippocampal volume and modify limbic brain activity [1, 2] in patients with Major depressive episodes (MDE). However, to the best of our knowledge, studies of the impact of AD on brain structural connectome have never been published yet. Thus, we compared brain structural connectome in depressed patients with and without previous AD treatment. Method: Our sample consisted of 55 patients with a current MDE (DSM-V). Twenty-three patients had previous antidepres sant treatment in the past with a median of 6 months (IQR = 23 months) and 32 had never been treated with AD previously. All of them were antidepressant-free for at least 1 month before the Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. T1-weighted image and a High angular resolution diffusion imaging scans in 60 directions were acquired for all patients. Brain structural connectome was built for each patient based on tractography from 164 cortices and sub-cortical grey matter structures (following Destrieux atlas). These connections were weighted by fiber density and their mean fractional anisotropy (FA). After bivariate analyses, multiple linear regressions were used to compare patients with and without previous AD treatment for connections' metrics. Statistical significance was ascertained by Student's t-test with Network Based Statistics, in applying shuffling 10, 000 times, p-value <0.05 and FWER-corrected. Result: Patients with and without previous AD treatment were not different in terms of age, sex and severity as measured by HDRS score. But patients with previous AD treatment had more frequently recurrent MDE (18 vs 9 patients, p < 0.05). Brain's fiber density and FA value did not differ between patients with and without history of MDE in bivariate analysis. Although not different in terms of fiber density neither in bivariate nor in multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex, smoking status and history of MDE, patients with previous AD treatment had significantly higher FA values in 436 connections (5.6%, mean Cohen's d = 0.66 ±0.18) than patients without previous AD treatment. The differences were located in sub-cortical U-fibers, bilateral thalamo-cortical radiations, bilateral superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, anterior commissural fibers, bilateral uncinate fasciculus, bilateral basal ganglia cortical radiations, bilateral cingulum bundle, and the left fornix. Conclusion: By using structural connectome, we found that patients with previous AD treatment have higher brain's diffusion capacity without changing its density, almost limbic tracts were involved as it was observed with functional MRI [3, 4]. This difference isn't related to history of MDE and severity of current episode. Together, these findings provided evidence that anti-depressant drugs could have long-term effect on brain connec-tions. Subsequent and future researches on imaging-based biomarkers for major depression need to treat carefully this information.",2017.0,,Z3EBG7DE,0,additional,1145
1145,Barriers to change in depressive symptoms after multidisciplinary rehabilitation for whiplash: the role of perceived injustice.,"Scott, Whitney; Trost, Zina; Milioto, Maria; Sullivan, Michael J. L.","OBJECTIVE: Depressive symptoms complicate patients' recovery after musculoskeletal injury. There is strong evidence to support the utility of multidisciplinary approaches for treating comorbid pain and depressive symptoms. Despite this, a significant proportion of patients may not experience meaningful reductions in depressive symptoms following intervention. The purpose of this study was to identify barriers to change in depressive symptom during multidisciplinary rehabilitation for patients with whiplash injuries. METHODS: A total of 53 patients with clinically meaningful levels of depressive symptoms before participating in a standardized multidisciplinary rehabilitation program participated in this study. Patients completed self-report measures of depressive symptoms, demographic factors, pain intensity, disability, posttraumatic stress symptoms, pain catastrophizing, perceived injustice, and self-efficacy upon commencement and completion of the rehabilitation program. Analyses examined whether pretreatment variables predicted change in depressive symptoms over treatment and the maintenance of clinically meaningful levels of depressive symptoms at posttreatment. RESULTS: Duration of work absence and perceived injustice were significant unique predictors of percent change in depressive symptoms in a linear regression analysis. Perceived injustice was the only significant unique predictor of the presence of clinically meaningful levels of depressive symptoms at posttreatment in a logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the identification of patients with high levels of perceived injustice and implementation of targeted interventions for these patients might contribute to greater improvements in their depressive symptomatology.",2015.0,10.1097/AJP.0000000000000095,TLHVV7DD,0,behavior,1146

A.","This study assessed levels of depressive symptomatology in a household probability sample of Mexico-born (N = 706) and U.S.-born (N = 538) Mexican Americans. We hypothesized that immigration status differences in acculturation, strain resources, and social conflict, as well as differences in the associations of these variables with depression, would account for differences in depression between U.S.-born and Mexico-born respondents. U.S.-born Mexican Americans had higher depression scores than those born in Mexico. When cultural and social psychological variables were controlled in a multiple regression analysis, the immigrant status difference persisted. Tests of interaction terms suggested greater vulnerability to the effects of low acculturation and low educational attainment among the U.S.-born relative to those born in Mexico; however, the immigrant status difference persisted after controlling for these interactions. Unmeasured variables such as selective migration of persons with better coping skills, selective return of depressed immigrants, or generational differences in social comparison processes may account for the immigration status difference.",1990.0,,Q9R4FNMH,0,diathesis,1147

It is designed to help patients with histories of depression develop core skills that will help to prevent the relapse and recurrence of depression in the future. This chapter reviews the rationale and background of the model, as well as relevant research. A case illustration is presented to provide additional detail about the use of common treatment strategies and client responses, describing the experience of one client who benefited tremendously from the treatment. In our experience, leading these classes presents both challenges and opportunities for the instructors: Staying mindfully in the moment while also running a group and teaching new approaches to experience blends many clinical and personal skills. As described in other chapters in this volume, current efforts to apply this model to a range of other disorders are under way. In the group described herein, participants also reported that the skills were of assistance in managing anxiety. We eagerly await ongoing clinical reports and research investigations to increase the applicability and future directions of mindfulness-based therapies.

Thirty-six outpatients with chronic PTSD, featuring resistant olfactory-induced flashbacks, were treated with six 1.5-hour sessions using hypnosis. The authors used the revised Impact of Events Scale (IES-R), Beck Depression Inventory, and Dissociative Experiences Scale as outcome measures. Significant reductions in symptomatology were recorded by the end of the 6-week treatment period for the IES-R, as well as for the Beck Depression Inventory and the Dissociative Experiences Scale; 21 (58 \% ) of the subjects responded to treatment by a reduction of 50 \% or more on the IES-R. Improvement was maintained at 6-month and 1-year follow-ups. Use of medication was curtailed. HOC shows potential for providing benefit to individuals suffering from PTSD with olfactory components.

D.; Ruepp, A.; Mller-Myhsok, B.; Hariri, A. R.; Binder, E. B.","Depression risk is exacerbated by genetic factors and stress exposure; however, the biological mechanisms through which these factors interact to confer depression risk are poorly understood. One putative biological mechanism implicates variability in the ability of cortisol, released in response to stress, to trigger a cascade of adaptive genomic and non-genomic processes through glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation. Here, we demonstrate that common genetic variants in long-range enhancer elements modulate the immediate transcriptional response to GR activation in human blood cells. These functional genetic variants increase risk for depression and co-heritable psychiatric disorders. Moreover, these risk variants are associated with inappropriate amygdala reactivity, a transdiagnostic psychiatric endophenotype and an important stress hormone response trigger. Network modeling and animal experiments suggest that these genetic differences in GR-induced transcriptional activation may mediate the risk for depression and other psychiatric disorders by altering a network of functionally related stress-sensitive genes in blood and brain.",2015.0,10.1016/j.neuron.2015.05.034,GVIQ3MBK,0,diathesis,1153

E.; Saba, S.; Zaher, M. and","Objective: Depression illnesses are commonly observed in hemodialysis (HD) patients, which can influence the quality of life of end-stage renal disease patients. We evaluate the prevalence and predictive risk factors of depression in the Arab population undergoing HD in Nazareth, Israel. Methods: We conducted a prospective study that included 71 patients in the HD unit with a mean age of 61.9 ± 14.13 years who had undergone HD and 26 healthy control subjects with a mean age of 59.3 ± 7.3. Beck's Depression Inventory and Hamilton Depression Scale assessments were administered. Blood analysis for hematological and biochemical parameters was obtained. Diagnosis was made using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders scale to correlate psychological variables with clinical, hematological, and biochemical parameters. Statistical analysis was carried out using analysis of variance followed by Tukey post-hoc multiple comparison tests. Results: The prevalence of depression was 43.7 \% in HD patients. Between HD patients and controls, cortisol values were 16.96 ± 0.5476 and 11.96 ± 1.116, respectively (P \textless 0.0001; 95 \% confidence intervals [CI]: 2.416-6.825). Between depressed HD patients versus control subjects, cortisol values were 16.48 ± 0.72 and 11.96 ± 1.116, respectively (P = 0.0013; 95 \% CI: 1.878-7.184). Hematological and biochemical parameters were compared between depressed HD and nondepressed patients, but differences between the two groups were found to be insignificant (P \textgreater 0.05). Conclusion: Our HD patients were severely depressed. Studies of glucocorticoid turnover activity such as cortisol, a potent chemical stress hormone, may be used as a model and marker for early diagnosis of depression among HD patients. The strong familial support system in Arabic traditions has failed to decrease depression among these patients. \textcopyright 2012 Armaly et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.",2012.0,10.2147/NDT.S31903,V7UL7C73,0,diathesis,1154
1154,TEMPS-A: validation of a short version of a self-rated instrument designed to measure variations in temperament.,"Akiskal, Hagop S.; Mendlowicz, Mauro V.; Jean-Louis, Girardin; Rapaport, Mark H.; Kelsoe, John R.; Gillin, J. Christian; Smith, Tom L.","OBJECTIVE: To validate a short English-language version of the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-autoquestionnaire version (TEMPS-A), a self-report questionnaire designed to measure temperamental variations in psychiatric patients and healthy volunteers. Its constituent subscales and items were formulated on the basis of the diagnostic criteria for affective temperaments (cyclothymic, dysthymic, irritable, hyperthymic, and anxious), originally developed by the first author and his former collaborators. Further item wording and selection were achieved at a later stage through an iterative process that incorporated feedback from clinicians, researchers, and research volunteers. METHOD: A total of 510 volunteers (284 patients with mood disorders, 131 relatives of bipolar probands, and 95 normal controls) were recruited by advertisement in the newspapers, announcements on radio and television, flyers and newsletters, and word of mouth. All participants were interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R, and completed the 110-item TEMPS-A and the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI-125). The factorial structure, the alpha coefficients, and the item-total correlations coefficients of the TEMPS-A and the correlation coefficients between the dimensions of the TCI and the TEMPS-A subscales were then determined. RESULTS: A principal components analysis with a Varimax rotation found that 39 out of the 110 original items of the TEMPS-A loaded on five factors that were interpreted as representing the cyclothymic, depressive, irritable, hyperthymic, and anxious factors. Coefficients alpha for internal consistency were 0.91 (cyclothymic), 0.81 (depressive), 0.77 (irritable), 0.76 (hyperthymic), and 0.67 (anxious) subscales. We found statistically significant positive correlations between all-but the hyperthymic-subscales and harm avoidance. Positive correlations with the hyperthymic and cyclothymic, and novelty seeking and negative correlations with the remaining subscales were also recorded. Other major findings included positive correlations between the hyperthymic and reward dependence, persistence and self-directedness; positive correlation between the self-transcendence and the cyclothymic, hyperthymic and the anxious; and negative correlations between the depressive, cyclothymic, irritable, anxious and cooperativeness. LIMITATION: As the full-scale anxious temperament was added after the four scales of the TEMPS-A were developed, it has only been evaluated in 345 subjects. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the TEMPS-A in its shortened version is a psychometrically valid scale with good internal consistency. The proposed five subscale structure is upheld. Concurrent validity against the TCI is shown. Most importantly, for each of the temperaments, we were able to show positive attributes which are meaningful in an evolutionary context, along with traits which make a person vulnerable to mood shifts. This hypothesized dual nature of temperament, which is upheld by our data, is a desirable characteristic for a putative behavioral endophenotype in an oligogenic model of inheritance for bipolar disorder.",2005.0,10.1016/j.jad.2003.10.012,C56PHTSD,0,personality,1155
1155,Hypertension in pregnancy,"Soydemir, F.; Kenny, L.","Hypertension is a common complication of pregnancy. Maternal and foetal outcomes depend upon the nature of the hypertension affecting the pregnancy, which can range from mild gestational hypertension to severe preeclampsia with its associated multisystemic complications. Preeclampsia is a leading cause of maternal mortality. The World Health Organization estimates that, worldwide, over 100 000 women die from preeclampsia each year, and the condition has remained one of the leading causes of maternal death in the UK over recent decades. Features of substandard care were shown in 46 \% of the 14 deaths associated with preeclampsia or eclampsia in the last report on Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths in the UK. Intracranial haemorrhage was the single largest cause of death, reflecting a failure of effective antihypertensive therapy and in particular ineffectual treatment of the raised systolic blood pressure. Although recent research has clarified the underlying aetiology of this condition, this has disappointingly not yet translated into a clinical useful prevention strategy. There is a clear need for greater awareness of the causes and optimal management of this common condition. \textcopyright 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

1156,"The birth of intersubjectivity: Psychodynamics, neurobiology, and the self.","Ammaniti, Massimo; Gallese, Vittorio","This book, the exciting collaboration of a developmental psychoanalyst at the forefront of functional magnetic resonance attachment research and a leading neurobiological researcher on mirror neurons, presents a fresh and innovative look at intersubjectivity from a neurobiological and developmental perspective. Grounding their analysis of intersubjectivity in the newest advances from developmental neuroscience, modern attachment theory, and relational psychoanalysis, Massimo Ammaniti and Vittorio Gallese illustrate how brain development changes simultaneously with relationally induced alterations in the subjectivities of both mother and infant. Ammaniti and Gallese combine extensive current interdisciplinary research with in-depth clinical interviews that highlight the expectant mothers changing subjective states and the various typologies of maternal representations. Building on Gallese's seminal work with mirror neurons and embodied simulation theory, the authors construct a model of intersubjectivity that stresses not symbolic representations but intercorporeality from a second-person perspective. Charting the prenatal and perinatal events that serve as the neurobiological foundation for postnatal reciprocal affective communications, they conclude with direct clinical applications of early assessments and interventions, including interventions with pregnant mothers. This volume is essential for clinicians specializing in attachment disorders and relational trauma, child psychotherapists, infant mental health workers, pediatricians, psychoanalysts, and developmental researchers. It combines fascinating new information and illustrative clinical experience to illustrate the early intersubjective origins of our own and our patients' internal worlds. Chapter 1 addresses the topic of intersubjectivity through relevant contributions from cognitive neuroscience, developmental psychology, philosophy, and psychoanalysis, while chapter 2 discusses the evolutionary origins of maternal care that have stimulated the capacity to be sensitive and more attuned to children. The transformations of maternal identity due to hormonal and neurobiological change, as well as alterations in the maternal psychic world and identity, are illustrated and discussed through three interviews with mothers who show different and prototypical maternal representations and psychic constellations during their pregnancies. Next, the authors examine research on the concept of maternal-fetal attachment, and in chapter 4 widen motherhood to encompass the role of fathers and of coparenting during pregnancy and the postnatal period, discussing the emerging triadic capacity during pregnancy as an anticipation of family dynamics after the birth of the baby. Chapter 5 provides a review of the research on mothers' brain transformations and its implications about the activation of care circuits. And chapter 6 deals further with the rise of the primary matrix of intersubjectivity. Chapter 7 considers the negative impact of parental stress on the infant's development, starting from pregnancy and including evidence of later difficulties in temperament and behavior. The concluding chapter applies the discoveries generated by parents-infant studies and laboratory research to the development of best practices in the community, such as interventions in the parents-child interaction systems, as suggested by translational research.

When they are, sources tend to differ greatly in their interpretations.

1158,Predicting PTSD using the New York Risk Score with genotype data: Potential clinical and research opportunities,"Boscarino, J. A.; Kirchner, H. L.; Hoffman, S. N.; Erlich, P. M.","Background: We previously developed a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) screening instrument, ie, the New York PTSD Risk Score (NYPRS), that was effective in predicting PTSD. In the present study, we assessed a version of this risk score that also included genetic information. Methods: Utilizing diagnostic testing methods, we hierarchically examined different prediction variables identified in previous NYPRS research, including genetic risk-allele information, to assess lifetime and current PTSD status among a population of trauma-exposed adults. Results: We found that, in predicting lifetime PTSD, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the Primary Care PTSD Screen alone was 0.865. When we added psychosocial predictors from the original NYPRS to the model, including depression, sleep disturbance, and a measure of health care access, the AUC increased to 0.902, which was a significant improvement (P = 0.0021). When genetic information was added in the form of a count of PTSD risk alleles located within FKBP5, COMT, CHRNA5, and CRHR1 genetic loci (coded 0-6), the AUC increased to 0.920, which was also a significant improvement (P = 0.0178). The results for current PTSD were similar. In the final model for current PTSD with the psychosocial risk factors included, genotype resulted in a prediction weight of 17 for each risk allele present, indicating that a person with six risk alleles or more would receive a PTSD risk score of 17 × 6 = 102, the highest risk score for any of the predictors studied. Conclusion: Genetic information added to the NYPRS helped improve the accuracy of prediction results for a screening instrument that already had high AUC test results. This improvement was achieved by increasing PTSD prediction specificity. Further research validation is advised. \textcopyright 2013 Boscarino et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.",2013.0,10.2147/NDT.S42422,PCVINPVT,0,diathesis,1159
1159,Cognitive dysfunction in bipolar disorder: future place of pharmacotherapy.,"Burdick, Katherine E.; Braga, Raphael J.; Goldberg, Joseph F.; Malhotra, Anil K.","Bipolar disorder is an episodic affective illness, once believed to involve complete inter-episode remission. More recent data have highlighted the presence of persistent symptoms during purported periods of wellness, including subsyndromal affective symptoms and neurocognitive impairment. These unremitting symptoms are of extreme clinical importance, as they are directly related to a worsening of clinical course, functional impairments and psychosocial difficulties in patients with bipolar disorder. Although there is now substantial evidence demonstrating the prevalence of neurocognitive impairment during euthymia, there have been few studies, to date, targeting this disabling aspect of the illness using pharmacological strategies. While treatment approaches have previously focused on primary affective and psychotic symptoms of the disease, it is important to consider the debilitating impact that impaired cognition has on patients with bipolar disorder. A recent focus has been placed on the significant need for large-scale clinical trials designed to specifically target cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia, with a parallel need existing in the field of bipolar research. There is now early evidence for the presence of neurocognitive deficits in patients with bipolar disorder and a relationship between these impairments and functional disability, making this a symptom domain that requires immediate clinical attention. Convergent data indicate a compelling need for formal assessment of cognition in patients with bipolar disorder, and for researchers and clinicans alike to consider the necessity for treatment specific to cognition in this population. Although limited data exist from cognitive enhancement trials in this population, there are a number of potential pharmacotherapy targets based on evidence from neuroimaging, molecular genetic, pharmacological and animal studies related to the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. Future directions for potential cognitive enhancement strategies in bipolar disorder may include medications that influence dopaminergic or glutamatergic neurotransmission; however, further work is needed to adequately assess the safety and effectiveness of these agents in bipolar patients. Finally, psychosocial intervention and/or cognitive remediation should be considered as alternatives to medications, although these techniques will also require additional systematic study.",2007.0,,UD96YF54,0,cognitive,1160

AIM: To summarise the findings of published studies regarding possible causes/predisposing factors and outcomes of fear of childbirth for childbearing women. DESIGN: A systematic review, searching five databases in March 2015 for studies on causes/predisposing factors and outcomes of fear of childbirth, as measured during pregnancy and postpartum. Quality of included studies was assessed independently by pairs of authors. Data were extracted independently by reviewer pairs and described in a narrative analysis. FINDINGS: Cross-sectional, register-based and case-control studies were included (n=21). Causes were grouped into population characteristics, mood-related aspects, and pregnancy and birth-related aspects. Outcomes were defined as mood-related or pregnancy and birth-related aspects. Differing definitions of fear of childbirth were found and meta-analysis could only be performed on parity, in a few studies. CONCLUSIONS: Stress, anxiety, depression and lack of social support are associated with fear during pregnancy. Need for psychiatric care and presence of traumatic stress symptoms are reported outcomes together with prolonged labour, longer labours, use of epidural and obstetric complications. Nulliparous and parous women have similar levels of fear but for different reasons. Since the strongest predictor for fear in parous women is a previous negative birth experience or operative birth, we suggest it is important to distinguish between fear of childbirth and fear after birth. Findings demonstrate the need for creating woman-centred birthing environments where women can feel free and secure with low risk of negative or traumatic birth experiences and consequent fear.",2018.0,10.1016/j.wombi.2018.07.004,GJWBBF9Q,0,additional,1161
1161,Biological perspectives: pain: it's not all in your head,"Kowalski, P. C.; Dowben, J. S.; Keltner, N. L.","Neuroanatomy correlates with the psychological changes of pain. Neuroplastic transformation appears in the reduction of gray matter volume, or shrinkage in the top-down cortical areas vital for working memory, problem solving, sequencing and discrimination of different information and cognitive modulation of pain via the descending pain modulatory tracts and control over other cortical areas involved in the emotional perception of pain. These latter areas become more active,thereby intensifying the susceptibility to negative affect associated with pain (Geha \& Apkarian, 2006).An animal model of chronic neuropathic pain was associated with impairment in the firing activity of the locus coeruleus and its expression of noradrenaline in ascending and descending pathways, which plays roles in not only pain perception, but mood, anxiety,attention and concentration, the sympathetic nervous system,and the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis,which serves to mobilize an organism's survival by the expression of cortisol in an immediate survival circumstance.",2014.0,,UC2N74DF,0,behavior,1162
1162,Enhanced pain perception prior to smoking cessation is associated with early relapse,"Nakajima, M.; Al'Absi, M.","Accumulated evidence suggests that nicotine induces analgesia, and endogenous pain regulatory mechanisms may be altered by chronic smoking. The extent to which individual differences in pain perception are related to smokers' ability to abstain from smoking has not been directly examined. Seventy-one smokers who were interested in quitting completed a pre-cessation laboratory session which included the cold pressor test (CPT). Pain ratings were collected during and after CPT. Also, mood changes, cardiovascular measures, and salivary cortisol samples were evaluated prior to, during, and after CPT. Participants attended 4 weekly follow-up assessment sessions after their quit day. Cox regression analysis revealed that higher pain ratings during and after CPT predicted greater risk for smoking relapse. These results remained significant after affective and physiological responses to CPT were controlled, suggesting that pain ratings prior to smoking cessation are potentially useful in identifying smokers who are at greater risk of early smoking relapse and may reflect underlying putative risk for nicotine dependence and relapse. \textcopyright 2011 Elsevier B.V.",2011.0,10.1016/j.biopsycho.2011.07.006,XAXVS5LH,0,cognitive_additional,1163
1163,Incidence and risk factors of insomnia in a population-based sample.,"LeBlanc, Melanie; Merette, Chantal; Savard, Josee; Ivers, Hans; Baillargeon, Lucie; Morin, Charles M.","INTRODUCTION: Despite the high prevalence of insomnia, there is little information about its incidence and risk factors. This study estimated the incidence of insomnia and examined potential risk factors in a cohort of good sleepers followed over a one-year period. METHODS: Participants were 464 good sleepers who completed 3 postal evaluations over a one-year period (i.e., baseline, 6 months, and 12 months). Questionnaires assessed sleep, psychological and personality variables, stressful life events and coping skills, and health-related quality of life. Participants were categorized into 3 subgroups: (a) good sleepers (i.e., participants who remained good sleepers at the 3 assessments), (b) insomnia symptoms incident cases (i.e., developed insomnia symptoms either at 6- or 12-month follow-up), and (c) insomnia syndrome incident cases (i.e., developed an insomnia syndrome either at 6- or 12- month follow-up). RESULTS: One-year incidence rates were 30.7 \% for insomnia symptoms and 7.4 \% for insomnia syndrome. These rates decreased to 28.8 \% and 3.9 \% for those without prior lifetime episode of insomnia. Compared to good sleepers and insomnia symptoms incident cases, insomnia syndrome incident cases presented a premorbid psychological vulnerability to insomnia, characterized by higher depressive and anxiety symptoms, lower extraversion, higher arousability, and poorer self-rated mental health at baseline. They also presented a higher level of bodily pain and a poorer general health. Five variables were associated with a new onset of an insomnia syndrome: previous episode of insomnia, positive family history of insomnia, higher arousability predisposition, poorer self-rated general health, and higher bodily pain. CONCLUSION: The one-year insomnia incidence rate was very high and several psychological and health factors were associated with new onset insomnia. Improved knowledge about the nature of these predisposing factors would be helpful to guide the development of effective public health prevention and intervention programs to promote better sleep quality.",2009.0,,QMSBZDN8,0,cognitive,1164

However, SMI is also a predictor for future dementia. Thus, there is a need to identify subtypes of SMI that are particularly related to inferior memory performance and may represent at-risk stages for cognitive decline. METHOD: A total of 2389 unimpaired subjects were recruited from the German Study on Ageing, Cognition and Dementia in Primary Care Patients (AgeCoDe), as part of the German Competence Network on Dementia. Clusters of SMI according to patterns of response to SMI questions were identified. Gender, age, depressive symptoms, apolipoprotein E (apoE) genotype, delayed recall and verbal fluency were included in a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis to identify discriminators between the clusters. RESULTS: We identified three clusters. Cluster 1 contained subjects without memory complaints. Cluster 2 contained subjects with general memory complaints, but mainly without memory complaints on individual tasks of daily living. Cluster 3 contained subjects with general memory complaints and complaints on individual tasks of daily living. Depressive symptoms, as the first-level discriminator, distinguished between clusters 1 and 2 versus cluster 3. In subjects with only a few depressive symptoms, delayed recall discriminated between cluster 1 versus clusters 2 and 3. CONCLUSIONS: In SMI subjects with only a minor number of depressive symptoms, memory complaints are associated with delayed recall. As delayed recall is a sensitive predictor for future cognitive decline, SMI may be the first manifestation of future dementia in elderly subjects without depression.",2007.0,10.1017/S0033291707001122,ZIH7RHSB,0,cognitive,1165

Sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-graders from two central city and one suburban school in a large Midwestern city were surveyed. Among other factors, they were questioned about (1) the frequency of their experiences with real-life violence, (2) the degree of violence-related anxiety they suffer as a result of these incidents, (3) their perceptions about violence in the real world, (4) their affective responses to television violence, and (5) the gratifications they associate with violent programs. The nature of the associations that emerged between frequency of victimization and the dependent factors was very different from that obtained between traumatic anxiety and these variables. Frequency of victimization, for example, was positively related to attraction to television violence and affective enjoyment of it, while anxiety was associated with both an aversion to violent television fare and a negative emotional reaction to it. Such discrepancies are interpreted in relation to the different symptoms and coping strategies underlying the victimization and anxiety measures. In addition to being significantly predicted by exposure to real-life violence and traumatic anxiety, children's gratifications and character identifications were found to intervene between these predictor variables and the cognitive and affective outcomes associated with television violence. Again, frequency of exposure to real-life violence and traumatic anxiety were associated with distinct patterns of relationships. All results are considered against a typology of victimization that distinguishes between the unique symptoms of anxiety associated with single-incident and chronic victimization.

1168,"Depressive symptoms in new first-time fathers: associations with age, sociodemographic characteristics, and antenatal psychological well-being.","Bergstrom, Malin","BACKGROUND: New fathers may be as vulnerable as new mothers to depression, and their symptoms also can affect the mother and child. The purpose of this study was to investigate depressive symptoms and associations with paternal age, sociodemographic characteristics, and antenatal psychological well-being in Swedish first-time fathers. METHODS: Depressive symptoms, defined as scores of 11 or greater on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, were investigated in 812 men 3 months after their first baby was born. The study sample included primarily Swedish-born, married or cohabiting men who participated in antenatal education classes during the partner's pregnancy. RESULTS: In all, 10.3 percent of study men suffered from depressive symptoms. Compared with fathers aged 29-33 years (sample mean age +/- 2 yr), the younger fathers had an increased risk for depressive symptoms (OR 2.55; 95 \% CI 1.50-4.35). Low educational level, low income, poor partner relationship quality, and financial worry increased the risk for depressive symptoms, but these factors could not explain the increased risk among the young. CONCLUSIONS: New fathers in their twenties seem to have an increased risk for depressive symptoms that cannot be explained solely by socioeconomic factors. Support should be offered to new fathers with particular focus on the young.",2013.0,10.1111/birt.12026,AK8YGYY9,0,cognitive_additional,1169
1169,Hopelessness as a predictor of non-response to fluoxetine in major depressive disorder.,"Papakostas, George I.; Petersen, Timothy; Homberger, Caitlin H.; Green, Cassandra H.; Smith, Juliana; Alpert, Jonathan E.; Fava, Maurizio","BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to study hopelessness as a predictor of response to fluoxetine in outpatients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). METHODS: The degree of hopelessness was assessed during the baseline visit with the use of the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) in 312 patients with MDD (56.1 \% women; 39.8 +/- 10.3 years of age) who entered an 8-week, 20-mg, fixed-dose, open trial of fluoxetine. With the use of a logistic regression we tested whether BHS scores at baseline predicted clinical response, controlling for the severity of depression as reflected by the total score on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17). With the use of a multiple regression we also tested whether BHS scores at baseline predicted HAM-D-17 scores at endpoint, controlling for HAM-D-17 scores at baseline. RESULTS: After controlling for depression severity at baseline, a greater degree of hopelessness was found to significantly increase the risk of non-response to fluoxetine (p = 0.0413), as well as the risk of greater endpoint depression severity (p = 0.0305). CONCLUSIONS: Hopelessness appeared to be associated with poorer response to treatment with fluoxetine in MDD, and this was independent of depression severity. Similar studies involving treatment with higher doses of fluoxetine and for greater duration as well as a placebo comparator arm are needed to further explore the relationship between hopelessness, placebo response and drug response.",2007.0,10.1080/10401230601163451,2WASRVGR,0,cognitive,1170

J.; Fischer, F. H.; Rose, M.; Penninx, B. W. J. H.; Thompson, P. M.; Hibar, D. P.","The pattern of structural brain alterations associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) remains unresolved. This is in part due to small sample sizes of neuroimaging studies resulting in limited statistical power, disease heterogeneity and the complex interactions between clinical characteristics and brain morphology. To address this, we meta-analyzed three-dimensional brain magnetic resonance imaging data from 1728 MDD patients and 7199 controls from 15 research samples worldwide, to identify subcortical brain volumes that robustly discriminate MDD patients from healthy controls. Relative to controls, patients had significantly lower hippocampal volumes (Cohen's d=-0.14, \% difference=-1.24). This effect was driven by patients with recurrent MDD (Cohen's d=-0.17, \% difference=-1.44), and we detected no differences between first episode patients and controls. Age of onset 21 was associated with a smaller hippocampus (Cohen's d=-0.20, \% difference=-1.85) and a trend toward smaller amygdala (Cohen's d=-0.11, \% difference=-1.23) and larger lateral ventricles (Cohen's d=0.12, \% difference=5.11). Symptom severity at study inclusion was not associated with any regional brain volumes. Sample characteristics such as mean age, proportion of antidepressant users and proportion of remitted patients, and methodological characteristics did not significantly moderate alterations in brain volumes in MDD. Samples with a higher proportion of antipsychotic medication users showed larger caudate volumes in MDD patients compared with controls. This currently largest worldwide effort to identify subcortical brain alterations showed robust smaller hippocampal volumes in MDD patients, moderated by age of onset and first episode versus recurrent episode status.",2016.0,10.1038/mp.2015.69,CV29NCWS,0,cognitive,1171
1171,Serum homocysteine levels and cognitive functioning in euthymic bipolar patients.,"Dias, Vasco Videira; Brissos, Sofia; Cardoso, Carlos; Andreazza, Ana Cristina; Kapczinski, Flavio","BACKGROUND: Studies have found elevated plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels in bipolar disorder (BD). We investigated serum Hcy levels in euthymic BD patients, and its relationship with cognitive and psychosocial functioning. METHODS: Sixty-five BD type I euthymic patients and 49 healthy controls were assessed using a neuropsychological test battery. Hcy levels were measured using an HPLC method with fluorescence detection. RESULTS: The mean Hcy levels were 1.37 mg/L for BD patients and 1.30 mg/L for healthy controls (P=0.342), male patients showing higher Hcy levels as compared to females (P=0.009). Older patients, those with later illness onset, and patients taking more medications showed higher Hcy levels, but no significant correlation was found with psychosocial functioning. Patients with elevated Hcy levels performed significantly worse on all neurocognitive tests, and in patients we found significant associations between Hcy levels and number of perseverations on the SCT (r=0.248, P=0.047), and number of moves on the ToH (r=0.265, P=0.033); however, a linear regression model revealed that Hcy was not a significant predictor of neurocognitive test performance. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that increased homocysteinemia may play a role in the pathophysiology of neurocognitive deficits in BD, with a higher impact among older patients, or who had a delayed onset of illness.",2009.0,10.1016/j.jad.2008.05.011,53SZ9VK3,0,cognitive,1172
1172,Methods of affective re-education.,"Klapman, J. W.","As already stated, group psychotherapy is largely, if not essentially, a re-educational process. This is not to say that it is any the less psychotherapeutic, for it will contain most of the affective elements of individual psychotherapy in somewhat different configuration. In the course of the therapy the mechanisms of catharsis, abreaction, intellectualization, etc., will likewise take place. We have already seen that lectures and textbook contents have the effect of removing resistances; they are like the interpretations which the psychoanalyst gives in the individual session. We also see a mechanism even more strikingly demonstrated by the lectures and sample history readings. It might be called a law of psychic resonance. For in the dynamics of every psychosis there are phases and facets which every individual will find similar to or identical with his own personality structures and functions. Patients finding such similarities will often be stimulated to productions from their own private desires and motivations, just as the setting into vibration of one resonance chamber will provoke a resonance of another of the same frequency. There are, however, some pertinent statements to be made on the techniques of administration. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",1946.0,,L4N5B4N5,0,psychodynamic,1173
1173,"The elephant tied up with string: a clinical case study showing the importance of NHS provision of intensive, time-limited psychoanalytic psychotherapy treatments","Shaw, S.","Prof. Richard Layard's influential advocacy for greater provision of ‘evidence-based' psychological therapies, based in part on an economic rationale, has lead to greatly increased provision of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and short-term therapies for depression, through the Increasing Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) initiative, whilst longer-term psychodynamic treatments are under threat, criticised as lacking an evidence base. This paper argues for the continuing provision of intensive thrice-weekly psychoanalytic psychotherapy treatments, time-limited to two years. It does so by describing such a treatment within an NHS psychotherapy department with a patient with a long history of severe personality pathology, including significant levels of perversity. The paper describes the patient's difficulties and his movement through the treatment, focussing on his difficulties making genuine emotional contact, his destructiveness of such contact, his acting out in the treatment, his perversity and the vital working through of the ending. The shifts the patient made are described, and follow-up information on the patient is given. The paper discusses the unique benefits of time-limited treatment and intensive psychoanalytic treatments for this ‘hard-to-help' group of patients, and the economic rationale that can be made for such treatments.",2014.0,,E5W5JVKR,0,psychodynamic,1174
1174,A social theory and treatment of depression,"Scheff, T. J.","This article outlines a theory of depression and the rudiments of a treatment plan. It builds upon my earlier study of interviews in a mental hospital and the work of the psychologist Helen Block Lewis. Theory: Recursive shame-based spirals may be the basic mechanism of both clinical depression and extreme violence. Shame-fear, shame-shame, and shame-anger spirals are described. Hypotheses: depression may result from a shame-shame spiral or when the anger in shame-anger spirals is directed in, recursively, without limit. Similarly, violence can result if the anger in the shame-anger spiral is directed out. These ideas lead to a proposal for treatment of depression focused on social bonds and hidden emotions. In this connection, possible effects of antidepressants on emotion are also discussed. \textcopyright 2009 Springer Publishing Company.",2009.0,,S63TSSLH,0,psychodynamic,1175

The association between these two variables in adult, non-student samples has not been consistently demonstrated. The current study sampled 188 adult men who completed the Gender Role Conflict Scale (GRCS) and the Beck Depression Inventory. Data revealed that while two of the subscales of the GRCS are associated with depression, that relationship is not as strong or significant when a measure of hopelessness is introduced. Success, Power, and Competition (one of the GRCS subscales), income, and hopelessness were found to be the most powerful predictors of clinical depression among this sample of adult men.

1176,Influence of the 5-HT3A receptor gene polymorphism and childhood sexual trauma on central serotonin activity,"Jang, K. I.; Lee, S. H.; Huh, H. J.; Chae, J. H.","Background Gene-environment interactions are important for understanding alterations in human brain function. The loudness dependence of auditory evoked potential (LDAEP) is known to reflect central serotonergic activity. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 5-HT3A serotonin receptor gene are associated with psychiatric disorders. This study aimed to investigate the effect between 5-HT3A receptor gene polymorphisms and childhood sexual trauma on the LDAEP as an electrophysiological marker in healthy subjects. Methods A total of 206 healthy subjects were recruited and evaluated using the childhood trauma questionnaire (CTQ) and hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS). Peak-to-peak N1/ P2 was measured at five stimulus intensities, and the LDAEP was calculated as the linearregression slope. In addition, the rs1062613 SNPs of 5-HT3A (CC, CT, and TT) were analyzed in healthy subjects. Results There was a significant interaction between scores on the CTQ-sexual abuse subscale and 5-HT3A genotype on the LDAEP. Subjects with the CC polymorphism had a significantly higher LDEAP than T carriers in the sexually abused group. In addition, CC genotype subjects in the sexually abused group showed a significantly higher LDAEP compared with CC genotype subjects in the non-sexually abused group. Conclusions Our findings suggest that people with the CC polymorphism of the 5-HT3A gene have a greater risk of developing mental health problems if they have experienced childhood sexual abuse, possibly due to low central serotonin activity. Conversely, the T polymorphism may be protective against any central serotonergic changes following childhood sexual trauma.",2015.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0145269,QENYED3W,0,diathesis,1177

However, there have been few empirical tests of this idea. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that depression vulnerability is related to difficulties with emotion regulation by comparing recovered-depressed and never-depressed participants (N = 73). In the first phase, participants completed questionnaires assessing their typical use of emotion regulation strategies. In the second phase, sad mood was induced using a film clip, and the degree to which participants reported to have spontaneously used suppression versus reappraisal to regulate their emotions was assessed. In the third phase, participants received either suppression or reappraisal instructions prior to watching a second sadness-inducing film. As predicted, suppression was found to be ineffective for down-regulating negative emotions, and recovered-depressed participants reported to have spontaneously used this strategy during the first sadness-inducing film more often than controls. However, the groups did not differ regarding the effects of induced suppression versus reappraisal on negative mood. These results provide evidence for a role for spontaneous but not instructed emotion regulation in depression vulnerability.",2010.0,10.1037/a0019010,HYVAD5KR,0,cognitive_additional,1178

Cognitive behavior treatment of residual symptoms was found to yield a significantly lower relapse rate than clinical management in recurrent depression at a 2-year follow-up. The objective of this investigation was to provide a 6-year follow-up of cognitive behavior treatment versus clinical management. METHOD: Forty patients with recurrent major depression who had been successfully treated with antidepressant drugs were randomly assigned to either cognitive behavior treatment of residual symptoms (supplemented by lifestyle modification and well-being therapy) or clinical management. In both groups, antidepressant drugs were tapered and discontinued. A 6-year follow-up was undertaken. During this period, no antidepressant drugs were used unless a relapse ensued. RESULTS: Cognitive behavior treatment resulted in a significantly lower relapse rate (40 \% ) at a 6-year follow-up than did clinical management (90 \% ). When multiple recurrences were considered, the group that received cognitive behavior treatment had a significantly lower number of relapses in comparison with the clinical management group. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the sequential use of cognitive behavior treatment after pharmacotherapy may improve the long-term outcome in recurrent depression. A significant proportion of patients with recurrent depression might be able to withdraw from medication successfully and to stay well for at least 6 years with a focused course of psychotherapy.",2004.0,10.1176/ajp.161.10.1872,C7W9XMFE,0,cognitive,1179

The purpose of this randomized, controlled trial was to determine the effectiveness of the Chronic Pain Management Program, an 8-week online intervention targeting cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and social pain determinants. Program efficacy and engagement was evaluated for 92 individuals with a diagnosis of chronic noncancer pain who had a current opioid prescription. Participants were recruited from primary care practices and Internet sites, then randomly assigned to receive access to the intervention either immediately (treatment group) or after an 8-week delay (wait-list comparison). Biweekly self-report measurements were collected using online surveys on pain, depressive symptoms, pain self-management behaviors, and health care utilization during the 8-week trial. Additional measurements of opioid misuse behaviors, pain self-efficacy, and medicine regimens were completed at baseline and week 8. Engagement was evaluated by examining completion of program learning modules. The results from analysis of variance showed that at week 8, the treatment group had significantly greater improvements on pain self-efficacy and opioid misuse measures than the wait-list comparison group. Engagement level was positively associated with improvements in pain intensity, pain interference, and pain self-efficacy. In conclusion, patients on opioids were able to engage and demonstrate positive outcomes using an Internet-based self-management program. Future efforts toward heightening engagement could further maximize impacts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",,,HMRZARYB,0,behavior,1181
1181,Gender differences in vulnerability to social stress: A Darwinian perspective,"Troisi, A.","This article offers a theoretical framework based on evolutionary thinking designed to clarify relationships between social stress and mental illness, including the origin of gender differences in vulnerability to stress. From a Darwinian perspective, stress is an interference with evolved behavioral strategies. Human behavior is organized around the pursuit of biological goals, and any social event that interferes with these evolved strategic goals may constitute a stressor. The response to such interference - the stress response - is made up of physiological, psychological and behavioral components. These components determine how individuals deal with those social events that were likely to reduce inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment. Evolved gender differences in commitment to goals play a role in determining individual differences in response to stressors. When a social stressor interferes with achieving a biological goal, its harmful impact will depend primarily on the importance of the goal to an individual, and the importance assigned to different goals by an individual does not depend exclusively on personal variables and cultural values. Two evolutionary theories are relevant to gender differences in vulnerability to social stress: sexual selection theory and life history theory. Clinical data from patients suffering from depression triggered by social stress are reviewed to test predictions derived from these theories. \textcopyright 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.",2001.0,10.1016/S0031-9384(01)00459-0,ITHMWP8A,0,diathesis,1182

The value of exercise-induced ST-segment depression for the prognostic evaluation of patients with 1 mm of ST depression or greater on the resting electrocardiogram is controversial. Methods and Results. Patients who underwent exercise myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (MPS) and had resting ST depression of 1 mm or greater with a nondiagnostic exercise electrocardiographic response (n = 1122) were followed up for 3.4 ± 2.3 years. Those with paced rhythm, pre-excitation, left bundle branch block, or myocardial revascularization within the first 60 days after MPS were excluded. Additional exercise-induced ST-segment depression was considered significant if ≥2 mm MPS was scored semiquantitatively by use of a 20-segment model of the left ventricle; the percentage of myocardium involved with stress defects ( \% myo) was derived by normalizing to the maximal possible score of 80. Hard events were defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiac death. A Cox analysis was used to determine independent predictors of hard events among clinical, exercise, and nuclear variables. Hard event rates increased as a function of \% myo for either patients with exercise-induced ST depression (1.4 \% /y for normal MPS vs 4.1 \% /y for \% myo \textless 10 \% , P \textless .03) or those without it (0.7 \% /y for normal MPS vs 3.0 \% /y for \% myo \textgreater 10 \% , P = .0001). Age, diabetes mellitus, shortness of breath as the presenting symptom, and \% myo were independent predictors of hard events. Exercise-induced ST depression was predictive of hard events only when it was 3 mm or greater. The presence and extent of perfusion defects, reflected in the \% myo, had incremental prognostic value over clinical variables and also over all degrees of exercise-induced ST depression. Conclusions. Although MPS effectively risk-stratifies patients with resting ST depression of 1 mm or greater, the prognostic value of exercise-induced ST depression is limited in these patients, with a small added risk when severe (≥3 mm).

However, a wide range of treatments for delinquency has historically not been successful in either stopping antisocial activity or preventing future relapse. Recently, gang or social delinquency has become a major concern in urban areas. This dissertation explored a specific aspect of social delinquents' psychological makeup that has not been explored in previous studies: the nature of their ability to empathize with others. Interviews with male social delinquent adolescents at the Maloney Correctional Institution were interwoven with theories of empathy and adolescence to bring new understanding to the cognitive and affective processes of this large and growing group of delinquent youth. The results of these interviews suggested a novel step of dividing empathy into two unique forms in relation to when an action occurs. Anticipatory empathy was used to describe feelings they had in considering future actions, and reactive empathy was used to describe their feelings after. It is hoped that the new insights presented here help in the development of more effective treatment. Some suggestions to this end are made in the last part of the dissertation.

Design: Data obtained from intake interviews, screening questionnaires, and baseline headache diaries of 283 consecutive adolescents referred for behavioral treatment of recurrent headache were reviewed for demographics, length of headache history, headache type, current headache activity, symptoms of anxiety and depression, perceived self-efficacy regarding headache control, school performance, participation in extracurricular activities, and school absenteeism. The study population was divided into 2 groups at the median number of days missed due to headache in the previous 6 months that school was in session. Adolescents who missed 2 or less days of school due to headache (low absenteeism) were compared with those who missed more than 2 days (high absenteeism). Results: Compared with the low absenteeism group, the high absenteeism group had higher scores on the Children's Depression Inventory (8.7 +/- 6.5 versus 6.8 +/- 6.2, P \textless .05) and lower academic performance (2.1 +/- 1.0 versus 1.7 +/- 0.8, P \textless .0001). The 2 groups were not statistically different in age, sex, length of headache history, type of headache, current headache frequency or intensity scores, anxiety scores, self-efficacy ratings, or participation in extracurricular activities. Conclusions: In a referred population, students who missed more school due to headache had higher depression scores and lower academic performance than students who missed less school. A directional relationship, however, cannot be implied from these results. Future studies should investigate the complex relationship between recurrent adolescent headache, potential risk or protective factors, and school absenteeism.

1189,The Borderline Prototype.,"Rasmussen, Paul R.","The borderline personality is one of the most challenging of the personality prototypes. In fact, it is not uncommon to come across therapists who refuse to take on such challenging clients. It may not have been until the emergence of dialectical behavior therapy, developed by Linehan, that clinicians began to develop some confidence that this personality disorder could be successfully treated. The personality attributes defining this prototype reveal a pattern characterized by extreme reactivity. Clients with a borderline prototype personality are hypersensitive to signs of rejections by others and respond with frantic efforts to prevent abandonment, or to at least save a sense of self-integrity. Their reactive nature contributes to the difficulties they have in committing to a treatment regimen. The more intensely a client is characterized by the borderline disorder, the greater are the treatment demands and often the need for inpatient treatment or more concerted and intense outpatient treatment, such as that using the dialectical-behavioral approach. Even when the borderline style is merely prototypal rather than floridly disordered, treatment challenges can be considerable. However, the individual with a borderline style is often able to cope with great uncertainty and to control emotional reactions such that recurrent interpersonal problems are less common and less severe. Because the individual with a borderline style of personality maintains such a strong desire for self-fulfilling interpersonal relations, treatment that provides a consistent and supportive atmosphere in which the client can reconsider uncertain cognitive assumptions and learn to regulate labile affective states should be most effective.

1190,Mother's personality and infant temperament.,"Macedo, A.; Marques, M.; Bos, S.; Maia, B. R.; Pereira, T.; Soares, M. J.; Valente, J.; Gomes, A. A.; Nogueira, V.; Azevedo, M. H.","We examined if perfectionism and the perception of being an anxious person were associated with more negative infant temperament ratings by the mothers. 386 women (mean age=30.08; standard deviation=4.21) in their last trimester of pregnancy completed the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS), the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and an item about their perception of being or not an anxious person. The Portuguese version of the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies and the Operational Criteria Checklist for Psychotic Illness were used to generate diagnoses according to DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria. After delivery, women completed eight items of the Difficult Infant Temperament Questionnaire (developed by our team) and filled in, again, the BDI-II and were interviewed with the DIGS. Women with depression (DSM-IV/ICD-10) and probable cases of depression using different cut-offs adjusted to Portuguese prevalence (BDI-II), in pregnancy and postpartum, were excluded. The Difficult Infant Temperament Questionnaire showed to have factorial validity and internal consistency. There was a statistically significant negative correlation between perfectionism total scale score and item 6 from the temperament scale ( is your baby irritable or fussy? ). Considering MPS 3-factor solution found for pregnancy there was also a statistically significant negative correlation between SOP and the same item. Women with low SOP differed from those with medium and high SOP in the total temperament score. Moreover, the low SOP group differed from the medium group on items three and four scores. There were no significant associations with SPP, which is the dimension more closely associated with negative outcomes. There was an association between anxiety trait status (having it or not) and scoring low, medium or high in the infant temperament scale. The proportion of anxious vs. non-anxious women presenting a high score on the infant temperament scale was higher (24.2 \ \% \ vs. 12.9 \ \% \ ). Linear regressions showed that SOP (low vs. medium/high) offered a significant contribution to the prediction of total temperament scale score and items 3 and 4 scores, but a logistic regression did not confirm trait anxiety as a significant predictor of mother's infant temperament perception. Concluding, a major result concerns the fact that higher levels of adaptive perfectionism (i.e. SOP) are associated (and predict) a less negative view of their infant's temperament. These results on the effect of mother's anxiety and perfectionism on the child temperament perception might have treatment implications. As perfectionism is not always maladaptive, some of its positive features could be used to enhance women's self-efficacy/sense of parental competence in their role as mothers and positive affect towards their infants. Also, antenatal interventions aimed at minimising anxiety could help to optimise infant temperament outcomes, which could, eventually, also, lead to subsequent maternal and infant mental health better outcomes.",2011.0,10.1016/j.infbeh.2011.06.009,LGCDSKWJ,0,personality,1191

1192,Quality of depressive experiences in borderline personality disorders: differences between patients with borderline personality disorder and patients with higher levels of personality organization.,"Leichsenring, Falk","Clinical observations suggest that depressive experiences in patients with borderline personality disorder have a specific quality. These experiences are characterized by emptiness and anger ( angry depression ) and are associated with primitive forms of object relations. In this study, this observation was tested empirically. A sample of borderline inpatients (N=30) was compared with a sample of inpatients with higher levels of personality organization suffering from neurotic disorders (N=30). Depression and other affects were assessed by the Affective Dictionary Ulm (Dahl, Holzer, \& Berry, 1992). The quality of object relations was assessed by a scale developed by Urist (1977), which was applied to responses in the Holtzman Inkblot Technique (Holtzman, Thorpe, Swartz, \& Herron, 1961). Correlations were assessed between depression, on the one hand, and anger, anxiety, and the quality of object relations, on the other hand. The clinical observations were confirmed: In the patients with borderline personality disorder, depression showed significant correlations with the affects of anger, anxiety, and fear, and with primitive forms of object relations. In the patients with higher levels of personality organization, no such correlations were found. The results are discussed with regard to the understanding of borderline disorders, diagnosis, and therapy.",2004.0,,4V2HVU4H,0,psychodynamic,1193
1193,A biopsychosocial approach to understanding postpartum adjustment.,"Boyd-Bragadeste, Kelly Lynn","The purpose of this doctoral dissertation is to examine the broad spectrum of postpartum adjustment difficulties and gain insight into their etiology and their impact on women and their families. Implications for treating these disorders are also discussed. This document includes a synthesis and critical review of the literature, focusing on the broad spectrum of biological, psychological, and psychosocial factors involved in the postpartum period. While the birth of a child is often joyous and blissful some individuals fail to recognize the tremendous impact and adjustment that soon follows in the lives of the women and their families. For some, that adjustment becomes further complicated by intense difficulty coping with significant hormonal and emotional upheaval, resulting in some type of postpartum-related mood disorder. Postpartum mood disorders fall on a continuum ranging from normal adjustment to postpartum blues, postpartum depression and anxiety reactions, to the most severe being postpartum psychosis. While each of these range in severity and duration, appropriate recognition, intervention, and treatment is essential to avoid further distress to the woman, baby, and the family at this most critical time. Most of the current literature focuses on the distinct-entity debate. This argument centers on whether postpartum disorders are specific to child bearing, or whether they are pre-existing disorders that surface during the postpartum period. Further problems in the literature include disagreement on clinical terminology and time frames for postpartum disorders, and the lack of consistent, reliable measures to assess postpartum-specific symptoms. It is argued here that a biopsychosocial approach to the understanding and treatment of these disorders is essential in order for women to recover. An individual case study of a woman whose postpartum distress mainly focused on breastfeeding, is discussed in order to illustrate the critical issues that may arise following childbirth. The individual clinical case is conceptualized from a cognitive, as well as, a developmental-psychodynamic perspective. In addition, a postpartum support group, led by the author is also presented, and used to illustrate some of the difficulties postpartum women face in seeking and utilizing therapeutic and support services.

METHODS: Adults with type 2 diabetes and no regular source of primary care were enrolled from the emergency room and randomized to an NP or MD practice. Chart reviews were conducted to assess processes of care; patient interviews and hemoglobin A1C (A1C) testing were performed to measure patient outcomes. RESULTS: NPs were more likely than MDs to document provision of general diabetes education and education about nutrition, weight, exercise, and medications. They were more likely to document patient height, urinalyses results, and A1C values. No differences were found in documenting current medications; alcohol, illicit drug, or tobacco use; depression; weight and blood pressure; foot and cardiovascular exams; blood glucose and creatinine testing; or referral to ophthalmologists. No differences were found in patient outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence of interdisciplinary differences in the processes of care employed by primary care NPs and MDs in caring for patients with type 2 diabetes. NPs documented the provision of diabetes education and selected monitoring tests more frequently than MDs; however, these differences were not reflected in 6-month patient outcomes.",2012.0,10.1177/014572170202800413,DYMLFNX9,0,cognitive_additional,1195
1195,Psychosocial and disability differences between patients with migraine headaches with and without aura.,"Napolitano, Tammy L.","The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between migraine headaches with and without aura and the level of disability, locus of control, headache management self-efficacy, and responses to treatments prescribed through a headache center. Previous research has shown these constructs may predict disability above and beyond the severity of migraine attacks and are to be considered when choosing appropriate treatment options. While these social learning factors are important in migraine headache, there remains a gap in the literature regarding migraine headaches with and without aura. Therefore, the purpose of this nonequivalent quasi-experimental study was to examine biopsychosocial differences between these two groups of chronic migraine headache patients. Participants in the study completed a set of measures assessing depression, anxiety, migraine related disability, Headache-Specific Locus of Control and Headache Management Self-efficacy. Results of the MANOVA analysis of the study indicated that patients with migraine with aura experience less frequent but potentially more severe migraine attacks compared to patients with migraine without aura. Results also demonstrate differences in responses to current treatment regimens suggesting that headache locus of control and headache management self-efficacy are significantly related to effectiveness of migraine headache treatment. This study promotes positive social change by encouraging headache treatment providers as they determine the most effective treatment while continuing to address referrals and the broader biopsychosocial factors important for individual migraine headache sufferers, their families, support systems, and employers as well.

Total exercise time (r=-0.40) and time until onset of pain (r=-0.44) were significantly correlated with perceived physical limitations. Somatic symptoms were related to total time (r=-0.38). Apart from a significant correlation between depressed mood and total exercise time (r=0.36), there was no corresponding correlation with well-being and sleep disturbance.

Matthew; Havens, Jennifer; Leukefeld, Carl","Objective: Rural women, particularly those in the criminal justice system, are at risk for HIV related to the increasing prevalence of injection drug use as well as limited services. Research on HIV risk correlates, including drug use and mental health, has primarily focused on urban women incarcerated in prisons. The purpose of this exploratory study is to examine dual HIV risk by 3 different mental health problems (depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) among drug-using women in rural jails. Method: This study involved random selection, screening, and face-to-face interviews with 136 women in 1 Appalachian state. Analyses focused on the relationship between mental health and HIV risk. Results: Nearly 80 \% of women self-reported symptoms of depression, and more than 60 \% endorsed symptoms consistent with anxiety and PTSD symptoms. Mental health significantly correlated with severity of certain types of drug use, as well as risky sexual activity. In addition, for women experiencing anxiety and PTSD, injection drug use moderated the relationship between mental health and risky sexual activity. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Based on these rates of drug use, mental health problems, and the emergence of injection drug use in rural Appalachia, the need to explore the relationships between these issues among vulnerable and understudied populations, such as rural women, is critical. Because of service limitations in rural communities, criminal justice venues such as jails provide opportune settings for screening, assessment, and intervention for drug use, mental health, and HIV education and prevention.

This misperception may increase binge drinking among adolescents with depressive symptomatology. The social networks of adolescents with depressive symptomatology are systematically different, providing different social learning opportunities. Using Add Health, we find that individuals who suffer from depressive symptomatology are more likely to have peers with higher depression scores. Adolescents with higher depressive symptomatology are more likely to perceive their peers as drinking alcohol. Our results suggest that normative beliefs are the key mediator in explaining the association between depressive symptomatology and binge drinking.

J.","OBJECTIVE: Neuropsychological deficits in the context of psychiatric disease may be associated with suicide risk. In this study, neuropsychological performance was compared among depressed patients with at least one prior suicide attempt of high lethality, depressed patients with low-lethality prior attempts, depressed patients with no prior suicide attempts, and nonpatients. METHOD: Fifty unmedicated patients in a major depressive episode (21 with no history of suicide attempts and 14 and 15 patients with previous attempts of low and high lethality, respectively) and 22 nonpatients were assessed. Groups were comparable in age, education, occupational level, and estimated premorbid intelligence. The neuropsychological battery produced scores within five composite domains: general intellectual functioning (current), motor functioning, attention, memory, and executive functioning. RESULTS: Patients whose prior suicide attempts were of high lethality performed significantly worse than all groups on tests of executive functioning and were the only group to perform significantly worse than nonpatients on tests of general intellectual functioning, attention, and memory. A discriminant function analysis revealed two prominent dimensions in the data: one that discriminated high-lethality suicide attempters from all other groups (primarily associated with performance on tests of executive functioning) and another that discriminated all depressed patient groups from nonpatients (associated with performance on measures of attention and memory). For the patients with high-lethality prior suicide attempts, deficits did not appear to reflect diffuse brain damage from past attempts, since the results of tests commonly affected by diffuse injury were not selectively impaired. CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychological deficits in depressed patients with high-lethality prior suicide attempts suggest impairment of executive functioning beyond that typically found in major depression. This more extensive neuropsychological impairment in the context of depression may be a risk factor for severe suicide attempts.",2001.0,10.1176/appi.ajp.158.5.735,P53CBRD7,0,cognitive_additional,1203

Afterwards, empirically substantiated starting points for psychosis psychotherapy are described, taking particular account of the cognitive model of delusions. Furthermore, disorder-specific strategies of building the therapeutic relationship are identified, which take account of symptoms, such as mistrust or affective flattening. Finally, the evidence-based therapeutic strategies for relapse prevention and symptom reduction are delineated.

1204,Stable trait variance of temperament as a predictor of the temporal course of depression and social phobia,"Naragon-Gainey, K.; Gallagher, M. W.; Brown, T. A.","A large body of research has found robust associations between dimensions of temperament (e.g., neuroticism, extraversion) and the mood and anxiety disorders. However, mood-state distortion (i.e., the tendency for current mood state to bias ratings of temperament) likely confounds these associations, rendering their interpretation and validity unclear. This issue is of particular relevance to clinical populations who experience elevated levels of general distress. The current study used the trait-state-occasion latent variable model (D. A. Cole, N. C. Martin, \& J. H. Steiger, 2005) to separate the stable components of temperament from transient, situational influences such as current mood state. We examined the predictive power of the time-invariant components of temperament on the course of depression and social phobia in a large, treatment-seeking sample with mood and/or anxiety disorders (N=826). Participants were assessed 3 times over the course of 1 year, using interview and self-report measures; most participants received treatment during this time. Results indicated that both neuroticism/behavioral inhibition (N/BI) and behavioral activation/positive affect (BA/P) consisted largely of stable, time-invariant variance (57 \% to 78 \% of total variance). Furthermore, the time-invariant components of N/BI and BA/P were uniquely and incrementally predictive of change in depression and social phobia, adjusting for initial symptom levels. These results suggest that the removal of state variance bolsters the effect of temperament on psychopathology among clinically distressed individuals. Implications for temperament-psychopathology models, psychopathology assessment, and the stability of traits are discussed. \textcopyright 2013 American Psychological Association.",2013.0,,UQW9UBAN,0,behavior,1205

Y.; Kuha, J.; Murphy, M.","Physical frailty in older people is an escalating health and social challenge. We investigate its physical, psychological, and social predictors, including how and for whom these conditions exert their effects. For 4638 respondents aged 65–89 years from wave 2 of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, we examine prediction of future physical frailty by physical, psychological, and social conditions using latent growth curve analysis with multiple indicators. In addition, we explore their indirect effects through disease and physiologic decline, and repeat these analyses after stratification by gender, age group, and selected conditions which are possible moderators. We find that chronic disease, allostatic load, low physical activity, depressive symptoms, cognitive impairment, and poor social support all predict future physical frailty. Furthermore, chronic disease and allostatic load mediate the effects of low physical activity, depressive symptoms, and cognitive impairment on future physical frailty. Finally, although poor social integration is not a predictor of future physical frailty, this condition moderates the indirect effect of poor social support through chronic disease by rendering it stronger. By virtue of their roles as predictor, mediator, or moderator on pathways to physical frailty, chronic disease, allostatic load, low physical activity, cognitive impairment, depressive symptoms, poor social support, and poor social integration are potentially modifiable target conditions for population-level health and social interventions to reduce future physical frailty in older people.",2017.0,10.1007/s10522-017-9677-9,J843B4BC,0,additional,1207

1208,Affective communication as a mechanism of change in the treatment of borderline personality disorder.,"Meehan, Kevin B.","This study examined the presence of an affective communication created between patient and therapist that allows for a dyadic process of symbolization in psychotherapy. The expression of affect is one of many channels by which patients communicate their internal world to the therapist, and due to impairments in object representations patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) may unconsciously communicate their internal experience through affect. This affective communication allows the therapist to use his/her own internal structures to give organization and meaning to the unsymbolized affect and give it back to the patient in a more symbolic form. The present study is part of a recent randomized controlled trial comparing Transference Focused Psychotherapy (TFP) to a psychodynamic supportive psychotherapy (SPT) and dialectic behavioral therapy (DBT) for patients with BPD. Therapists from the three treatments completed questionnaires focusing on the therapist's experience of an affective communication in the treatment. It was demonstrated (1) that the construct of affective communication can be reliably assessed by therapists of various treatment modalities, (2) that the construct of affective communication relates in predicted ways to similar constructs, and (3) that the affective communication created between therapist and patients with BPD in the initial stages of treatment predicted aspects of the course and outcome of a twelve month treatment. Specifically, it was found that patients stayed in treatment longer when therapists experienced their patients and themselves as enlivened and emotionally-present in the treatment. Overall, the relationship between affective communication and symptom change during treatment was not strong, with decreased negative affect predicting some indicators of symptom change. However, this construct may have a greater impact on structural change within the patient; affective communication variables were found to predict change in reflective function (RF) in patients treated in TFP but not SPT or DBT, with findings indicating that there is an optimal level of engagement and affect within which change in RF occurs. Affective communication is hypothesized to be of particular relevance to TFP due to that treatment's explicit effort to promote mentalization in the context of heightened affect in the attachment relationship with the therapist.

G.; Wong, C. K.; Stewart, R. A. H.; Williams, B. F. and","Background: Patients who suffer re-infarction during initial hospitalization for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have decreased survival compared to patients without re-infarction, so treatment of re-infarction may influence survival. Methods and results: To determine whether the utilization of reperfusion therapies varied within 12 h of re-infarction and was associated with 30-day mortality, we studied 552 patients with re-infarction of 17 073 patients with STEMI enrolled in HERO-2 in five regions (Russia, Eastern Europe, Western Countries, Asia, and Latin America). Patients presenting within 6 h of symptom-onset were randomized to receive either bivalirudin or unfractionated heparin intravenously just prior to streptokinase. Re-infarction occurred in 2.8 and 3.6 \% of bivalirudin and heparin treated patients, respectively (P = 0.004), but treatment assignment did not influence mortality after re-infarction. Patients with re-infarction had a higher 30-day mortality than those without re-infarction (24 vs. 10 \% ; P \textless 0.001 by Cox model). Within 12 h of re-infarction, fibrinolytic therapy was administered to 12.0 and 8.2 \% underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI); these two treatments were more frequently utilized in patients from Western countries (n = 112), compared to patients from other countries (n = 440) (34.8 and 16.1 \% compared to 6.1 and 6.1 \% , respectively, P \textless 0.001). Mortality was 15 \% in patients receiving reperfusion therapy for re-infarction and 27 \% for those with conservative management, hazard ratio (HR) 0.53 (95 \% CI 0.32-0.88), P = 0.01. In multiple Cox regression analysis which included adjustment for clinical variables and randomized treatment assignment, 30-day mortality after re-infarction varied by region (highest Latin America 29 \% , lowest Western countries 15 \% ; P = 0.01). Other independent prognostic factors included age, time from randomization to re-infarction, and Killip class at randomization. The HR for PCI treatment of re-infarction was 0.18 [(95 \% CI 0.04-0.76), P = 0.02] in analyses which excluded deaths within 12 h. Conclusion: Treatment of re-infarction with reperfusion therapies was markedly under-utilized, especially in non-western countries. PCI for re-infarction, in particular, was associated with a lower 30-day mortality, which may reflect both patient selection and effects of treatment. \textcopyright The European Society of Cardiology 2007.

Patients and methods: The participants were 55 stabilized outpatients with schizophrenia. Their mean age was 39.36 (SD =10.65) years. Social function was assessed using the Quality of Life Scale (QLS). Cognitive function was evaluated with the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). Clinical symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia, and the Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale. Results: Neither the MCCB cognitive domain score nor composite score was correlated with the QLS scores. However, of the 10 MCCB subtests, the Trail Making Test Part A and the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia-Symbol Coding (BACS-SC) scores were positively correlated with the QLS scores. Among clinical variables, especially the PANSS negative syndrome scale score had a strong negative correlation with the QLS scores. Stepwise regression analyses showed that the PANSS negative syndrome scale score was an independent predictor of the QLS scores, and although the BACS-SC score predicted the QLS common objects and activities subscale score, the association was not so strong compared to the PANSS negative syndrome scale score. Conclusion: These results indicate that speed of processing evaluated by BACS-SC could predict some aspect of social function but negative symptoms have a much stronger impact on global social function in people with schizophrenia.",2018.0,10.2147/ndt.S171207,RRZIU8LA,0,additional,1212

Objectives: To compare the trajectory of depressive symptoms among boys and girls from childhood to adolescence; to analyze the role of genetic, shared, and unique environmental factors in depression among prepubertal and pubertal male and female twins; and to investigate a possible link between liability to depression and one salient index of the child's environment: past-year life events.

Results: The impact of life events on depression was particularly evident in the adolescent girls. The results from model fitting indicate increased heritability for depression in this group, and its long-term consistency was mediated primarily by latent genetic factors. Model fitting also showed that at least part of the liability to depression and to life events can be linked to a common set of genes in the adolescent girls, and there is a notable developmental increase in the genetic variance for life events. Conclusions: The greater heritability for depression in pubertal girls, its genetic mediation over time, and the increase in genetic variance for life events may be one possible explanation for the emergence of increased depression among pubertal girls and its persistence through adolescence.",1999.0,,PSRGXK2Q,0,diathesis,1213
1213,Is pregnancy anxiety a distinctive syndrome?,"Huizink, A. C.; Mulder, E. J. H. and","Assessment of general anxiety during pregnancy may underestimate anxiety specifically related to pregnancy. Pregnancy anxiety rather than general anxiety has been shown to predict birth outcome and neuroendocrine changes during pregnancy. Therefore, a questionnaire on pregnancy anxieties was used to test their structure, and to examine their associations with general anxiety and depression. Nulliparous pregnant women with a normal risk status (N=230) filled in a 34-item questionnaire on pregnancy-related anxiety and other questionnaires covering general anxiety and depression. These questionnaires were filled in at 15-17, 27-28, and 37-38 weeks of gestation. A three-factor model of pregnancy anxiety was found by means of confirmatory factor analysis, reflecting 'fear of giving birth', 'fear of bearing a handicapped child' and 'concern about one's appearance'. General anxiety and depression measures explain only a small part of the variance of these fears. Pregnancy anxiety should be regarded as a relatively distinctive syndrome. Its measurement enables researchers and clinicians to address issues of prediction, identification and risk reduction more precisely and perhaps more effectively in the future. \textcopyright 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

METHOD: For 5 years, we followed 192 adolescents (56.2 \% female; 20.8 \% minority) who had participated in the Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study (TADS; TADS Team, 2004) and who had no prior diagnoses of AUD or SUD. TADS initial treatments were cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), fluoxetine alone (FLX), the combination of CBT and FLX (COMB), or clinical management with pill placebo (PBO). We used both the original TADS treatment response rating and a more restrictive symptom count rating. During follow-up, diagnostic interviews were completed at 6- or 12-month intervals to assess onset of AUD or SUD as well as MDD recovery and recurrence. RESULTS: Achieving a positive response to MDD treatment was unrelated to subsequent AUD but predicted a lower rate of subsequent SUD, regardless of the measure of positive response (11.65 \% vs. 24.72 \% , or 10.0 \% vs. 24.5 \% , respectively). Type of initial MDD treatment was not related to either outcome. Prior to depression treatment, greater involvement with alcohol or drugs predicted later AUD or SUD, as did older age (for AUD) and more comorbid disorders (for SUD). Among those with recurrent MDD and AUD, AUD preceded MDD recurrence in 24 of 25 cases. CONCLUSION: Effective short-term adolescent depression treatment significantly reduces the rate of subsequent SUD but not AUD. Alcohol or drug use should be assessed prior to adolescent MDD treatment and monitored even after MDD recovery.",2012.0,10.1037/a0026929,GYLH4J4V,0,cognitive,1218

M.","Background Mexican-American women exhibit high rates of prenatal maternal depressive symptoms relative to the general population. Though pregnant acculturated Mexican-American women experience cultural stressors such as acculturation, acculturative stress and discrimination that may contribute to elevated depressive symptoms, the contribution of these socio-cultural correlates to depressive symptomology is unknown. Method Ninety-eight pregnant women of Mexican descent were recruited from a community hospital clinic during their first trimester. Women completed surveys about acculturation, acculturative stress, perceived discrimination, general perceived stress, and maternal depressive symptoms as well as the potential protective factor of Mexican cultural values. Results Women who experienced greater acculturative and perceived stress, but not perceived discrimination or acculturation, reported significantly elevated depressive symptoms during pregnancy. Also, women who experienced greater acculturative stress identified with a mixture of Mexican and American cultural values. However, only the Mexican cultural value of respect was protective against maternal depressive symptoms while adhering to the Anglo value of independence and self-reliance was a risk factor. Limitations A limitation in the study is the cross-sectional and descriptive self-report nature of the work, underscoring the need for additional research. Moreover, physiological measures of stress were not analyzed in the current study. Conclusions Results point to acculturative stress, above other cultural stressors, as a potential intervention target in culturally competent obstetric care. These findings have implications for maternal mental health treatment during pregnancy, which likely affects maternal-fetal programming and may favorably affect perinatal outcomes in the vulnerable Mexican-American population.",2015.0,10.1016/j.jad.2015.01.036,7URUK5T3,0,diathesis,1222
1222,Towards the pharmacotherapy of eating disorders.,"Pederson, Kristine J.; Roerig, James L.; Mitchell, James E.","The purpose of this review is to discuss pharmacological options for the treatment of patients with eating disorders. Sequentially described are pharmacotherapy studies of anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge-eating disorder (BED). The quantity of drug trials performed with AN patients has been very limited. While the majority of studies have failed to show medication efficacy for the acute treatment of AN, there is data which suggests that fluoxetine hydrochloride may play a role in preventing relapse during maintenance therapy. Atypical antipsychotics, most often olanzapine, have shown promise in a number of uncontrolled studies. BN has been most extensively studied, with the majority of pharmacological trials focusing on antidepressants. Fluoxetine, at a dose of 60 mg/day, is FDA-approved for the treatment of BN. Psychotherapy, particularly cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is of well-established utility in BN and data suggests that the combination of an antidepressant plus CBT is superior to either treatment alone. Recently, there has been interest in the 5-HT3 antagonist, ondansetron, and the anticonvulsant, topiramate. BED investigators have focused largely on antidepressants, which may reduce symptoms of depression and augment psychotherapy. While sibutramine and topiramate have both been associated with weight loss in controlled trials, the former appears to be fairly well-tolerated and the latter appears to be responsible for the emergence of significant cognitive and peripheral nervous system side effects in some patients. Further pharmacological research with eating disorder patients is needed, particularly in the areas of AN and BED. Also, pharmacological augmentation strategies for those not responding to primary therapies should be explored.",2003.0,10.1517/14656566.4.10.1659,MGP2CJBI,0,cognitive,1223

D.; Escamilla, M.; Gonzalez, S.; Mercedes Ramirez, E.; Zavala, J.; Conteras, J.; Almasy, L.; Raventós, H.; Nicolini, H.; Villa, E.; Rodriquez, M.","Background: Personality traits have been suggested as potential endophenotypes for Bipolar Disorder (BP), as they can be quantitatively measured and show correlations with BP. We have previously reported on the heritability of factors in the Five Factor personality model (NEO) in a large sample of pedigrees segregating BP Type I and related psychiatric phenotypes.1 In Hare et'al. (2011) we reported all five NEO factor scores were heritable'(from 0.23 for neuroticism to 0.32 for openness). In addition, four of these factors correlated significantly with a broad phenotype of BP (BPI, BPII, schizoaffective BP, recurrent unipolar depression). Neuroticism correlated positively with BP, while conscientiousness, extraversion, and agreeableness correlated negatively with BP. A recent genome-wide linkage scan for bipolar disorder in these families reported BP susceptibility loci at 8q24 and 14q32.2 to identify other genetic loci that might have relevance to BP, we subsequently performed a quantitative trait linkage analysis for the five NEO factors in this same set of families. Methods: The present study utilized data from 3757 individuals from 686 extended pedigrees originally ascertained for having multiplex cases of BP (963 cases of BPI or schizoaffective BP). This sample consists of Latino families (Mexican or Central American ancestry) from the United States, Mexico, Guatemala, and Costa Rica. The majority of subjects also completed assessments using The NEO Personality Inventory, Revised (NEO PI-R). Raw scores for each of the five factors were analyzed for linkage analysis using SOLAR (Sequential Oligogenic Linkage Analysis Routines). All subjects were genotyped using the Illumina HumanLinkage-24 Bead Chip, with an average genetic coverage of 0.67 cM. Two point linkage scores were calculated for each trait as a quantitative variable with the following co-variables taken into account (age, gender, language, and lifetime depression and mania scores from the Lifetime Dimensions of Psychosis Scale3). Results: Suggestive evidence for linkage was found for neuroticism at 1p11.2 (LOD=2.52), 1p22 (2.26), 6q23.3 (2.32), 16p12 (2.79), 17q11.2 (2.24)), extraversion at 4p15.3 (2.33), agreeableness at 4q31.1 (2.37), 5q34 (2.80), 7q31.1 (2.56), 16q22 (2.52), and conscientiousness at 4q31.1 (2.50). Each of the above traits have been shown to be correlated with the broad BP phenotype in this same sample. In addition, for the trait of openness, we found significant evidence of linkage to chromosome 3p24.3 (rs336610, LOD=4.75) and suggestive evidence at 1q43 (2.74), 3p26 (2.71), 5q35.1 (3.03), 11q14.3 (2.61), 11q21 (2.30), and 19q13.1 (2.52). Discussion: Our findings with regard to genetic loci for NEO personality traits support linkage findings of the openness trait to chromosome 19q13 and the agreeableness trait to 4q31 reported in other population based linkage studies. In terms of the genetics of BP in the Latino population we report a number of additional suggestive loci for personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) not previously identified in linkage analyses for the BP phenotype itself. These regions may harbor genes which play a role in these personality traits and (by virtue of their correlation with BP) may point to additional regions containing genes which contribute to the BP phenotype.",2017.0,10.1016/j.euroneuro.2015.09.010,DBZG9F2Z,0,additional,1226

1227,Piercing the body: A symbolic voice. A psychoanalytic view of contemporary body modification.,,"Modern body modification has been little discussed in the psychoanalytic literature despite its relatively widespread practice. Those clinicians and researchers who have looked at body modification have focused their attention on psychiatric populations. Much of this work assumes that these practices are inevitably accompanied by a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, childhood abuse, a history of early trauma, and primitive episodes of dysphoria. This dissertation proposes a different perspective, based on the Freudian concept of the relationship between Eros and the death drive. Body piercing is presented as a link between the mind and the body, an articulation on the body which transforms the unconscious, destructive nature of the death drive into the realm of Eros. The goal of this study is to better understand the motives, drives, and intrapsychic processes at work in individuals who engage in body piercing. This study compares two groups, each comprised of 20 non-psychiatric subjects. One group consists of individuals with multiple ( \textgreater body piercings, excluding ear piercings. The other group contains subjects who pierce only the ears. The two groups will be compared on a number of instruments: the SCL-90-R; the MCMI; the HEI; and the Rorschach, scored according to R. R. Holt's scoring method. Hypotheses were posited that the subjects who practiced body piercing would score lower than the subjects who did pierce on the SCL-90-R and the MCMI. These hypotheses were confirmed with regard to depression, dysthymia, anxiety, paranoid ideation, dependence, and the overall indicator of psychopathology. A hypothesis was posited that the subjects who practiced body piercing would evidence less annihilation anxiety, on the HEI, than those subjects who did not engage in body piercing. Although this hypothesis was not confirmed with statistical significance, there was a trend toward significant difference with the body piercing subjects scoring lower on general (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",1995.0,,RK3NF9NX,0,psychodynamic,1228

J.; Zotev, V.; Phillips, R.; Misaki, M.; Yuan, H.; Drevets, W. C.; Bodurka, J.","OBJECTIVE: Patients with depression show blunted amygdala hemodynamic activity to positive stimuli, including autobiographical memories. The authors examined the therapeutic efficacy of real‐time functional MRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI‐nf) training aimed at increasing the amygdala's hemodynamic response to positive memories in patients with depression. METHOD: In a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, randomized clinical trial, unmedicated adults with depression (N=36) were randomly assigned to receive two sessions of rtfMRI‐nf either from the amygdala (N=19) or from a parietal control region not involved in emotional processing (N=17). Clinical scores and autobiographical memory performance were assessed at baseline and 1 week after the final rtfMRI‐nf session. The primary outcome measure was change in score on the Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the main analytic approach consisted of a linear mixed‐model analysis. RESULTS: In participants in the experimental group, the hemodynamic response in the amygdala increased relative to their own baseline and to the control group. Twelve participants in the amygdala rtfMRI‐nf group, compared with only two in the control group, had a >50% decrease in MADRS score. Six participants in the experimental group, compared with one in the control group, met conventional criteria for remission at study end, resulting in a number needed to treat of 4. In participants receiving amygdala rtfMRI‐nf, the percent of positive specific memories recalled increased relative to baseline and to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: rtfMRI‐nf training to increase the amygdala hemodynamic response to positive memories significantly decreased depressive symptoms and increased the percent of specific memories recalled on an autobiographical memory test.

RESULTS: The mean incidence rate ratio was 0.78, indicating a reduction of the incidence of depressive disorders by 22 \% in experimental compared with control groups. Heterogeneity was low to moderate (I(2)=33 \% ). The number needed to treat to prevent one case of depressive disorder was 22. Moderator analyses revealed no systematic differences between target populations or types of prevention (universal, selective, or indicated). The data included indications that prevention based on interpersonal psychotherapy may be more effective than prevention based on cognitive-behavioral therapy.

1232,Advanced BrainAGE in older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus,"Franke, K.; Gaser, C.; Manor, B.; Novak, V.","Aging alters brain structure and function and diabetes mellitus (DM) may accelerate this process. This study investigated the effects of type 2 DM on individual brain aging as well as the relationships between individual brain aging, risk factors, and functional measures. To differentiate a pattern of brain atrophy that deviates from normal brain aging, we used the novel BrainAGE approach, which determines the complex multidimensional aging pattern within the whole brain by applying established kernel regression methods to anatomical brain magnetic resonance images (MRI). The Brain Age Gap Estimation (BrainAGE) score was then calculated as the difference between chronological age and estimated brain age. 185 subjects (98 with type 2 DM) completed an MRI at 3Tesla, laboratory and clinical assessments. Twenty-five subjects (12 with type 2 DM) also completed a follow-up visit after 3.8 ± 1.5 years. The estimated brain age of DM subjects was 4.6 ± 7.2 years greater than their chronological age (p = 0.0001), whereas within the control group, estimated brain age was similar to chronological age. As compared to baseline, the average BrainAGE scores of DM subjects increased by 0.2 years per follow-up year (p = 0.034), whereas the BrainAGE scores of controls did not change between baseline and follow-up. At baseline, across all subjects, higher BrainAGE scores were associated with greater smoking and alcohol consumption, higher tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) levels, lower verbal fluency scores and more severe deprepession. Within the DM group, higher BrainAGE scores were associated with longer diabetes duration (r = 0.31, p = 0.019) and increased fasting blood glucose levels (r = 0.34, p = 0.025). In conclusion, type 2 DM is independently associated with structural changes in the brain that reflect advanced aging. The BrainAGE approach may thus serve as a clinically relevant biomarker for the detection of abnormal patterns of brain aging associated with type 2 DM. \textcopyright 2013 Franke, Gaser, Manor and Novak.",2013.0,10.3389/fnagi.2013.00090,7A7JFMJK,0,cognitive_additional,1233

1234,The effectiveness of psychodynamic-interpersonal therapy (PIT) in routine clinical practice: A benchmarking comparison,"Paley, G.; Cahill, J.; Barkham, M.; Shapiro, D.; Jones, J.; Patrick, S.; Reid, E.","Aims. To investigate the effectiveness of psychodynamic-interpersonal therapy (PIT) in a routine clinical practice setting. Methods. Full pre-post data were available on 62 out of a total of 67 patients aged between 19 and 60 years. Patients were seen over a 52-month period (2001-2005) receiving a course of PIT therapy (mean number of sessions = 16.9, median number of sessions = 16). The outcomes were assessed using a range of outcome measures: the 32-item version of the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP-32), the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation Outcome Measure (CORE-OM), and the Beck Depression Inventory - Second Edition (BDI-II). Study data were benchmarked against comparative national and local data. Results. There were significant pre-post reductions on all measures: IIP-32 effect size (ES) = 0.56; CORE-OM ES = 0.76; BDI-II ES = 0.76. Reliable and clinically significant change was achieved by 34 \% of clients on the BDI-II and by 40 \% of clients on the CORE-OM. Clients with high pre-therapy levels of interpersonal problems had poorer outcomes. Conclusion. Benchmarking our results against both national and local comparative data showed that our results were less favourable than those obtained where PIT had been used in efficacy trials, but were comparable with reports of other therapies (including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)) in routine practice settings. The results show that PIT can yield acceptable clinical outcomes, comparable to CBT in a routine care setting, within the context of current limitations of the practice-based evidence paradigm. \textcopyright 2008 The British Psychological Society.",2008.0,,WJ2U5XGD,0,psychodynamic,1235
1235,Resilience and meaning: The development of concepts of self and world in adult survivors of childhood trauma.,"Herringshaw, Lee Rovira","This study explores the phenomenon of resilient adults who have experienced multiple traumatic events, including sexual abuse, in childhood. It focuses on the lifelong development of concepts of self and world in resilient individuals. This qualitative study analyzes the experiences of eight adults who were asked to describe their understanding of themselves and the world through time. Each subject completed a demographic questionnaire, a trauma inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Satisfaction With Life Scale, the Self-Efficacy Scale and The World Assumptions Scale. The interviews were conducted, transcribed, and analyzed for common themes and patterns of concept development. The clinical measures were rated and applied to the analysis of the interview data. Suggestions were made for enhancing the development of resilience in adult survivors of childhood trauma in clinical treatment. The data describe the subjects as endorsing a strong belief in the benevolence of the world. They do not identify themselves as victims of a cruel world, but rather tend to view themselves as powerful agents of change in the world, and give little credence to the influence of justice as a force in determining the distribution of events. They believe that some occurrences are random in nature, and do not personalize the occurrence of negative events in their lives. The group endorses a belief in luck, an impersonal distributional property of positive events, much more strongly than a belief in the purely random occurrence of positive events and view their traumatic experiences as randomly assigned to and endured by them. In the developmental patterns of the subjects studied, recovery was heralded by the proclamation of an existential truce in which they achieved a complex cognitive reconstruction of concepts of self and world which accounted for the extremes of both positive and negative experiences of their lives. The subjects describe a pattern of ultimately relinquishing the search for meaning to their childhood trauma. In the developmental pattern of the subjects studied an early experience of powerlessness was followed by a period of perceived inauthenticity of the highly functioning outer self.

1236,Longitudinal relationship of low leisure satisfaction but not depressive symptoms with systemic low-grade inflammation in dementia caregivers.,"von Kanel, Roland; Mausbach, Brent T.; Mills, Paul J.; Dimsdale, Joel E.; Patterson, Thomas L.; Ancoli-Israel, Sonia; Ziegler, Michael G.; Allison, Matthew; Chattillion, Elizabeth A. and","Objectives: This study aimed to further elucidate the biobehavioral mechanisms linking dementia caregiving with an increased cardiovascular disease risk. We hypothesized that both elevated depressive symptoms and a behavioral correlate of depression, low leisure satisfaction, are associated with systemic inflammation. Method: We studied 121 elderly Alzheimer's disease caregivers who underwent 4 annual assessments for depressive symptoms, leisure satisfaction, and circulating levels of inflammatory markers. We used mixed-regression analyses controlling for sociodemographic and health-relevant covariates to examine longitudinal relationships between constructs of interest. Results: There were inverse relationships between total leisure satisfaction and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha; p = .047), interleukin-8 (IL-8; p \ \textless \ .001), and interferon-gamma (IFG; p = .020) but not with IL-6 (p = .21) and C-reactive protein (p = .65). Lower enjoyment from leisure activities was related to higher levels of TNF-alpha (p = .045), IL-8 (p \ \textless \ .001), and IFG (p = .002), whereas lower frequency of leisure activities was related only to higher IL-8 levels (p = .023). Depressive symptoms were not associated with any inflammatory marker (all p values \ \textgreater \ .17). Depressive symptoms did not mediate the relationship between leisure satisfaction and inflammation. Discussion: Lower satisfaction with leisure activities is related to higher low-grade systemic inflammation. This knowledge may provide a promising way of improving cardiovascular health in dementia caregivers through behavioral activation treatments targeting low leisure satisfaction.

The present study examined reward dysregulation--measured via the behavioral activation system (BAS)--as one putative marker of BPSD in adolescence. A diverse group of 425 outpatient adolescents between 11 and 17 years of age (52 \ \% \ male) completed the Behavioral Inhibition and Activation Scale (BIS-BAS) scale to measure reward dysregulation. Semi-structured interviews determined diagnoses and severity of mood symptoms. Parent-reported BAS was associated with increased symptoms of mania, and parent and adolescent-reported BAS were associated with symptoms of depression. Parent-reported BIS scores were associated with increased symptoms of mania. Results held independent of diagnostic status. Furthermore, parent BIS/BAS reports were stronger predictors for manic symptoms compared to adolescent-reports. Results extend work in adults with BPSD, suggesting a transdiagnostic association between reward dysregulation and mood symptom severity in adolescence.",2013.0,10.1007/s10802-013-9746-8,7DCEVR86,0,personality,1238
1238,QT wave dispersion in patients with panic disorder,"Atmaca, M.; Yavuzkir, M.; Izci, F.; Gurok, M. G.; Adiyaman, S.","Objective QT dispersion (QTd), defined as the maximal inter-lead difference in QT intervals on 12 leads of the surface electrocardiogram (ECG), reflects the regional heterogeneity of ventricular repolarization and has been suggested as an important marker for risk of arrhythmia in addition to the QT interval. Some investigators proposed that it might be a predisposing factor for arrhythmic events and sudden death. Thus, we aimed to investigate whether QTd differs in patients with panic disorder from that in healthy controls. Methods: In 40 panic disorder patients and 40 healthy controls, Qmax, Q min, and QTd values were measured. In addition, the Hamilton depression rating scale and the panic agoraphobia scale were scored for both patients and healthy volunteers. Results: Qmax and Qmin values in the panic disorder patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls. The mean corrected QTd was significantly greater in the patients than in the controls. One-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA; using left atrial size, age and heart rate as covariates) also corrected the significant difference. In addition, ANCOVA revealed a significant main effect for the diagnosis, indicating a significantly higher QTd for patients compared with controls. Conclusion: QTd might be associated with panic disorder. Future studies in larger samples evaluating the effects of treatment are required. \textcopyright Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.",2012.0,10.1007/s12264-012-1237-3,B2HD8V2R,0,cognitive_additional,1239

Whether or not these psychological changes are present after remission remains a matter of debate. To date, no study provided concomitant assessment of cognition and psychological functions in this particular clinical setting. METHOD: Using a cross-sectional design, 58 remitted outpatients (36 with unipolar early-onset depression (EOD) and 22 with bipolar disorder (BD)) were compared to 62 healthy controls. Assessment included detailed neurocognitive measures and evaluation of the five factor personality dimensions (NEO-Personality Inventory). RESULTS: Group comparisons revealed significant slower processing speed, working and episodic memory performances in BD patients. EOD patients showed cognitive abilities comparable to those of elderly controls. In NEO PI assessment, both BD and EOD patients displayed higher Depressiveness facet scores. In addition, the EOD but not BD group had lower Extraversion factor, and Warmth and Positive Emotion facet scores than controls. CONCLUSIONS: After remission from acute affective symptoms, older BD patients show significant impairment in several cognitive functions while neuropsychological performances remained intact in elderly patients with EOD. Supporting a long-lasting psychological vulnerability, EOD patients are more prone to develop emotion-related personality trait changes than BD patients.",2010.0,10.1016/j.jns.2010.08.045,I6NUSHR7,0,cognitive,1240
1240,Counteracting depression and delinquency in late adolescence: The role of regulatory emotional and interpersonal self-efficacy beliefs.,"Caprara, Gian Vittorio; Gerbino, Maria; Paciello, Marinella and","A prospective study was conducted to examine a conceptual model in which affective and interpersonal social self-efficacy beliefs affect depression and delinquency concurrently and at 4 years of distance, controlling for earlier adolescents' exposure to family violence and adolescents' self-regulation problems. Three hundred and ninety adolescents aged 11-13 years at Time 1 participated in the study. Data were collected 1, 3, and 7 years later. Self-reported questionnaires were used to measure emotional and interpersonal self-efficacy, depression, and delinquency. Findings of structural equation modeling corroborated the posited paths of relations, showing that in middle adolescence self-efficacy beliefs related to individuals' perceived capacity to handle negative emotions and to express positive emotions influence depression and delinquency concurrently and longitudinally through interpersonal social self-efficacy, namely individuals' beliefs in their capability to handle relations with parents, to rebuff peer pressures toward transgressive behavior, and to empathize with others' feelings. A significant and direct path from self-efficacy to manage negative emotions to concurrent depression was found. The posited covariates (i.e., adolescents' self-regulation problems at age 12 and exposure to family violence at age 13) predicted both lower self-efficacy beliefs and higher adjustment problems. Findings showed the importance of adolescents' emotional and interpersonal self-efficacy beliefs in contrasting maladjustment, despite the impairing effect of personal and contextual risk factors. Overall, the study provides suggestions regarding the crucial factors that could decrease adolescents' risk of detrimental outcomes.

There was a significant temporal association between mother and child diagnoses, especially in unipolar families, and most children who experienced a major depressive episode did so in close proximity to maternal depression. Regression analyses indicated that children's own stressful life events, maternal disorder, and the interaction of the two significantly predicted children's changes in depression. Children exposed to high stress but with nonsymptomatic mothers were significantly less depressed subsequent to stressors than those who also had symptomatic mothers. The results are discussed in terms of the reciprocal, interpersonal context of depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",,,53WDSVUP,0,diathesis,1243

J.","The impact of depression on quality of life (QOL) and social support has neither been well characterized in clinical samples of women with perimenopausal depression (PMD) nor have the relative contributions of depression and other menopausal symptoms (e.g., hot flushes) to declining QOL been clarified. In this study, we compared QOL measures, social support, and functional disability in PMD and non-depressed perimenopausal women. We evaluated women aged 40–60 years who presented with menstrual cycle irregularity, elevated plasma FSH levels, and met criteria for perimenopause. A structured clinical interview was administered to determine the presence or absence of major and minor depression. Outcome measures included the Quality of Life Enjoyment Scale Questionnaire, the Sheehan Disability Scale, the Global Assessment of Functioning, the Social Adjustment Scale, and the Duke Social Support Index. Kruskal-Wallis tests and ANOVAs were used to compare outcome measures. Ninety women with PMD and 51 control women participated in this study. Women with PMD reported significantly decreased QOL, social support, and adjustment and increased disability compared with non-depressed perimenopausal women. Neither perimenopausal reproductive status alone nor the presence of hot flushes had a significant negative impact on QOL measures. PMD is accompanied by significant reductions in QOL, social support, and disability similar to depression in women at other stages of life. PMD may also contribute to decreased QOL in community- or clinic-based samples of perimenopausal women. It remains unclear whether the clinical characteristics we identified reflect pre-existing risk factors for depression during the perimenopause or the effects of a current depression. Future clinical and treatment studies in perimenopausal women should distinguish depressed women when outcome measures include QOL.",2016.0,10.1007/s00737-016-0701-x,7JLZCYVW,0,cognitive_additional,1244

T.","Background: Neuroendocrine dysregulation influenced by psychosocial stress is related to breast cancer recurrence. Very few studies examine the impacts of psychotherapy on diurnal cortisol patterns among breast cancer survivors. Methods: Forty-eight breast cancer patients who completed active cancer treatment were randomly assigned to receive either 8 weekly body-mind-spirit (BMS) group therapy sessions or 1 educational (EDU) session. Self-report measures included the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and the Meaning in Life questionnaire (MLQ) including two subscales: MLQ-Presence and MLQ-Search. Salivary cortisol levels were collected by the subjects in their homes at the time of awakening, 30 and 45 min after awakening, and at 12.00, 17.00, and 21.00 h. Measurement time points include baseline, the 2nd month (completion of BMS therapy), the 5th month, and the 8th month. Results: There were no significant differences in BDI-II scores (p \textgreater 0.05) and MLQ-Presence scores (p \textgreater 0.05) between BMS and EDU groups at baseline or across the three follow-ups. Nevertheless, greater MLQ-Search scores were found in the BMS group compared to the EDU group during the 5th month of follow-up (p \textless 0.01). The higher level of cortisol at 21.00 h (p \textless 0.01) and a flatter diurnal cortisol pattern were more likely to occur in EDU than in BMS participants (p \textless 0.05) at the 8th month of follow-up. Conclusion: BMS group therapy likely contributed to enhancing an active search for meaning in life toward more opportunities for personal growth and to maintaining stable cortisol responses to everyday life stress for breast cancer survivors.

Subjects were treated with one or more index courses of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) followed by continuation ECT (C-ECT, up to 6 months of ECT) or maintenance ECT (M-ECT; ECT beyond 6 months) when necessary. Electroconvulsive therapy was continued until remission or until minimal residual symptoms were evident. Pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy were reintroduced during C-ECT or M-ECT. Premorbid functioning was achieved by 5 of 6 cases. Cognitive deficits were not evident. In fact, comparison of pre-ECT and post-ECT neuropsychological functioning revealed a trend toward improved auditory and verbal memory on most of the results.

O.","This article offers a critical review of the literature examining spouse responses to the pain behaviour of chronic pain patients. An overview is given of 27 studies that have explored patient-spouse interactions in chronic pain, together with a summary of the various findings. It is concluded that the body of research is broadly supportive of the operant behavioural paradigm on which it has developed. Patients' coping with chronic pain is significantly influenced by the ways in which those closest to them respond to their expressions of discomfort. However, it is argued that the behavioural model alone is insufficient when accounting for the complexity of pain couples' interactions. The impact of the spouse's response is mediated by a range of cognitive and affective variables that have yet to be fully recognized in the research literature. It is also argued that the operationalization of the construct of solicitousness, which is central to research on chronic pain couples, is flawed. A number of suggestions for future theoretical and empirical developments in this area are made. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",,,KS753FMN,0,behavior,1247

METHOD: A two-stage screening process was used to recruit 44 depressed adolescents and their parents from pediatrics clinics between 1997 and 1999. Measures included structured diagnostic interviews with adolescents, the Child and Adolescent Services Assessment, the Child and Adolescent Functional Assessment Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory (for parents), and the Communication subscale of the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment. RESULTS: When history of service use was controlled, two predictors--parental perceptions of family burden and presence of a substance use disorder in the adolescent--were most strongly related to parental depression-identification. The data support the role of parental identification of depression as a mediator between the parent/adolescent characteristics and reports of mental health service use. CONCLUSION: Enhancing parents' abilities to identify and understand signs of depression may facilitate service use among depressed adolescents.",2002.0,10.1097/00004583-200203000-00009,FG2253LM,0,cognitive,1249

However, it is possible that these differences may reflect current mental state, subtype of mood disorder, or familial traits. This study aimed to determine objective and subjective sleep–wake profiles in individuals aged 15–25 years with a current major depressive episode, in relation to familial traits. Methods: Frequency matching was employed to ensure that each individual with a confirmed family history of BD (FH+) could be compared to four controls who did not have a familial mood disorder (FH–). Pre-selected objective actigraphy and subjective Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) ratings were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and applying the Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) correction for false discoveries. Results: The sample comprised 60 individuals with a mean age of 19 years. The FH+ (n=12) and FH– groups (n=48) differed on three key sleep parameters: mean sleep duration on week nights (P=.049), variability in waking after sleep onset (P=.038), and daily disturbances (PSQI dimension of sleep disturbance and daytime dysfunction; P=.01). Conclusions: The sleep profiles we identified in this study, especially the daily disturbances phenotype, provide support for research into endophenotypes for BD. Also, the findings may offer the opportunity for more tailored, personalized interventions that target specific components of the sleep–wake cycle in individuals with a family history of BD.",2016.0,10.1111/bdi.12450,L8BYC62J,0,cognitive_additional,1250
1250,"Impulsivity, aggression and brain structure in high and low lethality suicide attempters with borderline personality disorder","Soloff, P.; White, R.; Diwadkar, V. A.","Impulsivity and aggressiveness are trait dispositions associated with the vulnerability to suicidal behavior across diagnoses. They are associated with structural and functional abnormalities in brain networks involved in regulation of mood, impulse and behavior. They are also core characteristics of borderline personality disorder (BPD), a disorder defined, in part, by recurrent suicidal behavior. We assessed the relationships between personality traits, brain structure and lethality of suicide attempts in 51 BPD attempters using multiple regression analyses on structural MRI data. BPD was diagnosed by the Diagnostic Interview for Borderline Patients-revised, impulsivity by the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS), aggression by the Brown-Goodwin Lifetime History of Aggression (LHA), and high lethality by a score of 4 or more on the Lethality Rating Scale (LRS). Sixteen High Lethality attempters were compared to 35 Low Lethality attempters, with no significant differences noted in gender, co-morbidity, childhood abuse, BIS or LHA scores. Degree of medical lethality (LRS) was negatively related to gray matter volumes across multiple fronto-temporal-limbic regions. Effects of impulsivity and aggression on gray matter volumes discriminated High from Low Lethality attempters and differed markedly within lethality groups. Lethality of suicide attempts in BPD may be related to the mediation of these personality traits by specific neural networks. \ \textcopyright \ 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",2014.0,,K4RG3AUD,0,personality,1251
1251,The absence of positive psychological (eudemonic) well-being as a risk factor for depression: a ten year cohort study.,"Wood, Alex M.; Joseph, Stephen","BACKGROUND: Previous research in psychiatry has focused on how negative personality traits and impaired well-being form risk factors for depression. This study presents the first longitudinal test of whether the absence of positive well-being forms an additional unique risk factor for depression. METHODS: A large cohort of 5566 people completed a survey at two time points, aged 51-56 at Time 1 and 63-67 at Time 2. Positive psychological well-being included measures self-acceptance, autonomy, purpose in life, positive relationships with others, environmental mastery, and personal growth. Personality was measured as extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience. Depression was measured with the CES-D scale. RESULTS: People with low positive well-being were 7.16 times more likely to be depressed 10-years later. After controlling for personality, negative functioning, prior depression, demographic, economic, and physical heath variables, people with low positive well-being were still over twice as likely to be depressed. LIMITATIONS: All measures were self-report, rather than based on peer-report or physician diagnosis. An aging population was studied; replication is needed in younger populations. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of positive well-being forms a substantial risk factor for depression, independent of the presence of negative functioning and impaired physical health. Older people with low PWB are very likely to become depressed over 10 years, and preventative intervention and monitoring of these individuals are indicated.",2010.0,10.1016/j.jad.2009.06.032,NI2NJB7U,0,personality,1252

Regression analyses revealed that increased media multitasking was associated with higher depression and social anxiety symptoms, even after controlling for overall media use and the personality traits of neuroticism and extraversion. The unique association between media multitasking and these measures of psychosocial dysfunction suggests that the growing trend of multitasking with media may represent a unique risk factor for mental health problems related to mood and anxiety. Further, the results strongly suggest that future research investigating the impact of media use on mental health needs to consider the role that multitasking with media plays in the relationship.",2013.0,10.1089/cyber.2012.0291,VEKKZRGU,0,personality,1253

Suggestions have been made to advance psychological understanding of negative symptoms by focusing on the social cognitive processes involved in symptom formation and maintenance. METHODS: Following the recommendations by the National Institute of Mental Health workshop on social cognition in schizophrenia, this study investigated associations between negative symptoms and various aspects of social cognition including Theory of Mind (ToM), attribution, empathy, self-esteem, and interpersonal self-concepts in 75 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and 75 healthy controls. RESULTS: Negative symptoms were significantly associated with difficulties in ToM, less readiness to be empathic, lower self-esteem, less self-serving bias, negative self-concepts related to interpersonal abilities, and dysfunctional acceptance beliefs. Different aspects of social cognition were mildly to moderately correlated and interacted in their impact on negative symptoms: Difficulties in ToM were associated with negative symptoms in persons with low but not in persons with medium or high levels of self-esteem. Taken together, the social cognition variables and their hypothesized interaction explained 39 \% of the variance in negative symptoms after controlling for neurocognition and depression. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the relevance of self-concepts related to social abilities, dysfunctional beliefs, and global self-worth alone and in interaction with ToM deficits for negative symptoms and thereby provide a helpful basis for advancing psychosocial interventions.",2011.0,10.1093/schbul/sbr066,XE8R3CQ8,0,cognitive_additional,1254
1254,A prevention and rehabilitation program for juvenile female gang members.,"Deza, Marjorie","Women's involvement in violence has become a concern topic, especially girls gang memberships. Gangs have spread from major urban areas to the suburbs and even to rural communities. Usually, juveniles who are perceived as dangerous or persistent in their criminal behavior are transfer to the adult criminal justice system. It would be better to reasonably invest in treatment and prevention of violent juveniles. Juvenile female gang members have a series of characteristic in common. They come from dysfunctional families where the absence of one parent is a trait. They also come from families where delinquency and parents' arrests are frequent. These girls have a history of abuse, first in their homes and later in the streets by their boyfriends and/or peers. Juvenile female gang members get involved in gangs as their opportunity to belong somewhere, as their way of survive from a series of traumatic experiences they have gone through and that they continue being exposed to. It is important to look at patterns that are common to the majority of families of hyper aggressive children. Aggression itself is an interactive event. Therefore, children from violent and aggressive family system are more likely to have their pro-social behaviors go ignored. In these situations many youth grow up learning and using antisocial skills to meet their personal needs. Initially, gang membership fulfills the need for company, providing friendship and places for recreation; offers opportunities of getting out of poverty. These initial social and recreational activities are later replaced with criminal activities, like drug use and trafficking, robberies, prostitution, and violent crimes. This program has been designed as an attempt to provide these girls with the opportunities to reorganize their life, giving them a new meaning, and understanding family dynamics. The program will have as an objective, to provide them with the appropriate tools to increase self-esteem, being able not to depend on a boyfriend. To assist them to acquire effective coping mechanisms to deal with different negative experiences, as well as to develop more pro-social ways to interact with others. They will be assisted to replace negative and destructive channels to externalize anger with positive, constructive, and more effective ones. The program will provide individual therapy as well as group and family therapy. They will receive different group sessions addressing self-esteem, depression, coping and social skills, anger management, relaxation techniques, and relapse prevention, among others. It will be implemented an eclectic therapeutic approach, using psychodynamic therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, behavioral therapy, art/drama therapy. In order for the program to be effective, different entities must be involved. It is a multi system effort, where the community needs to participate as a whole.

1255,The management of bipolar disorder.,"Saunders, Kate E. A.; Geddes, John R.",Bipolar disorder is a common mental disorder which is relapsing and remitting in nature. Subsyndromal symptoms are common and associated with poorer outcomes. Management of the disorder can be challenging and depends on the polarity and severity of the mood episode.,2016.0,10.12968/hmed.2016.77.3.175,H2AFHFCJ,0,cognitive,1256
1256,The salivary alpha amylase over cortisol ratio as a marker to assess dysregulations of the stress systems,"Ali, N.; Pruessner, J. C.","Different factors have been associated with changes in the regulation of the two major stress response systems of the human body, the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Changes in these systems have been associated with various (psycho)pathologies across adulthood, and are thus frequently assessed within the context of allostatic load. Early Life Adversity (ELA) has been identified as one such factor. Individuals with histories of ELA show evidence of elevated basal and reactive salivary alpha amylase (sAA) levels (a marker of SNS activity), blunted cortisol levels (a marker of HPA axis activity), and an asymmetrical relationship between the two variables. However, variable methods used in the past to measure each variable, and the relationship between the two systems, prevent us from drawing firm conclusions.This preliminary study investigated whether the ratio of reactive sAA over reactive cortisol would be more informative to investigate the relationship between the two stress systems than the ratio of cortisol over sAA, or either marker alone, and whether there is a systematic link between this marker and subjective indexes of chronic stress and depression. We studied this in a total of 37 subjects (n = 20 with signs of early life adversity and n = 17 without) exposed to the Trier social stress test. Using a specific formula to determine the ratio of sAA over cortisol, we found a systematically stronger positive relationship with indexes of chronic stress and depression when compared to cortisol over sAA, or either marker alone. Our findings suggest that the ratio of sAA over cortisol might be a better marker of stress systems dysregulation than the ratio of cortisol over sAA, sAA or cortisol alone. The usefulness of this marker for other chronic stress states as found in allostatic load is discussed. \textcopyright 2011 Elsevier Inc.",2012.0,10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.10.003,MMLPGEFI,0,diathesis,1257
1257,The association between the serotonin and dopamine neurotransmitters and personality traits,"Delvecchio, G.; Bellani, M.; Altamura, A. C.; Brambilla, P.","Evidence from previous studies has reported that complex traits, including psychiatric disorders, are moderately to highly heritable. Moreover, it has also been shown that specific personality traits may increase the risk to develop mental illnesses. Therefore the focus of the research shifted towards the identification of the biological mechanisms underpinning these traits by exploring the effects of a constellation of genetic polymorphisms in healthy subjects. Indeed, studying the effect of genetic variants in normal personality provides a unique means for identifying candidate genes which may increase the risk for psychiatric disorders. In this review, we discuss the impact of two of the most frequently studied genetic polymorphisms on personality in healthy subjects, the 5-HTT polymorphism of the serotonin transporter and the DRD2/DRD4 polymorphisms of the D2/D4 dopamine's receptors. The main aims are: (a) to highlight that the study of candidate genes provides a fruitful ground for the identification of the biological underpinnings of personality without, though, reaching a general consensus about the strength of this relationship; and (b) to outline that the research in personality genetics should be expanded to provide a clearer picture of the heritability of personality traits.",2016.0,,832D4GMF,0,personality,1258

1259,Meeting the psychological needs of cardiac patients: An integrated stepped-care approach within a cardiac rehabilitation setting,"Child, A.; Sanders, J.; Sigel, P.; Hunter, M. S.","Depression and anxiety are commonly experienced by cardiac patients and are associated with reduced quality of life and mortality, but the evidence for the effectiveness of medical and psychological treatments for depression has been mixed. We explored the psychological needs of cardiac patients and developed a steppedcare model of psychological care, which was both accessible and acceptable to cardiac patients. The clinical psychologist was integral to the cardiac rehabilitation team and provided joint working, support and a range of interventions. Preliminary evidence suggests that offering a range of psychological treatments might be an effective way of meeting cardiac patients' psychological needs. Specific psychological interventions included: psycho-education sessions addressing behavioural risk factors and adjustment, brief individual therapy for patients with mild-to-moderate, as well as for those with severe, mental illness, group workshops and individual therapy, using cognitive-behaviour therapy for anxiety, depression and adjustment to adverse life events. Overall, the percentage of patients reporting depression and anxiety reduced by 13 \ \% \ and 19 \ \% \ , respectively, following this cardiac rehabilitation programme compared with a national average of 4 \ \% \ .

1260,"Neuropsychological performance in bipolar I, bipolar II and unipolar depression patients: a longitudinal, naturalistic study.","Xu, Guiyun; Lin, Kangguang; Rao, Dongping; Dang, Yamei; Ouyang, Huiyi; Guo, Yangbo; Ma, Jinxiang; Chen, Jichong","BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that cognitive deficits existed in mood disorders. Nevertheless, whether neuropsychological profiles differ three main subtypes of mood disorder (Bipolar I, Bipolar II and UP) remain understudied because most current studies include either mixed samples of bipolar I and bipolar II patients or mixed samples of different states of the illness. The main aim of the present study is to determine whether, or to some extent, specific cognitive domains could differentiate the main subtypes of mood disorders in the depressed and clinically remitted status. METHOD: Three groups of bipolar I (n=92), bipolar II (n=131) and unipolar depression (UP) patients (n=293) were tested with a battery of neuropsychological tests both at baseline (during a depressive episode) and after 6 weeks of treatment, contrasting with 202 healthy controls on cognitive performance. The cognitive domains include processing speed, attention, memory, verbal fluency and executive function. RESULTS: At the acute depressive state, the three patient groups (bipolar I, bipolar II and UP) showed cognitive dysfunction in processing speed, memory, verbal fluency and executive function but not in attention compared with controls. Post comparisons revealed that bipolar I depressed patients performed significantly worse in verbal fluency and executive function than bipolar II and UP depressed patients. No difference was found between bipolar II and UP depressed patients except for the visual memory. After 6 weeks of treatment, clinically remitted bipolar I and bipolar II patients only displayed cognitive impairment in processing speed and visual memory. Remitted UP patients showed cognitive impairment in executive function in addition to processing speed and visual memory. The three remitted patient groups scored similarly in processing speed and visual memory. LIMITATION: Clinically remitted patients were just recovered from a major depressive episode after 6 weeks of treatment and in relatively unstable state. CONCLUSION: Bipolar I, bipolar II and UP patients have a similar pattern of cognitive impairment during the state of acute depressive episode, but bipolar I patients experience greater impairment than bipolar II and UP patients. In clinical remission, both bipolar and UP patients show cognitive deficits in processing speed and visual memory, and executive dysfunction might be a status-maker for bipolar disorder, but a trait-marker for UP.",2012.0,10.1016/j.jad.2011.11.029,FNKWBM83,0,cognitive,1261

The final sample included 395 women (mean age=26.73 years, SD=6.74 years) who were predominantly of Han majority ethnicity (84.6 \ \% \ ) and had completed middle-school education or lower (63.0 \ \% \ ). Participants were recruited initially from commercial sex venues (e.g., saunas, massage parlors) in the cities of Nanchang, Luizhou, Nanning, Urumqi, and Karamay as well as two districts of Chongqing municipality and subsequently via snowball procedures. They completed a battery of self-report measures assessing beliefs about HIV and PrEP, psychosocial influences, demographics and willingness to use HIV PrEP. Willingness to use HIV PrEP was predicted by high levels of trust in physicians and more reported unmet interpersonal belongingness needs. Beyond these factors, willing and unwilling groups were differentiated on the basis of intervention-specific beliefs (perceived stigma and self-efficacy in use of PrEP). Together, findings suggested interpersonal factors should be considered in concert with perceptions of intervention characteristics in assessing motivations to enroll in PrEP within this particular at-risk group.",2013.0,10.1080/09540121.2012.726341,KBYEM2HV,0,behavior,1262

Neighborhood danger, maternal depressive symptoms, and supportive parenting were assessed in early childhood. Peer group acceptance was measured in middle childhood, and data on antisocial behavior and social skills were collected when boys were 11 and 12 years old. Results were consistent with an additive effects model of child antisocial behavior. In contrast, peer relationships were stronger predictors of social skills than were family factors. Support for mediation was found in models involving neighborhood danger and supportive parenting. However, only peer group acceptance predicted change in antisocial and prosocial behavior.

J.","BACKGROUND: In the course of treatment, a small group of patients with Parkinson disease (PD) develop a harmful pattern of compulsive dopaminergic drug use, called the dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS). Individual factors may influence susceptibility. OBJECTIVES: To identify predisposing factors to DDS in a population of outpatients with PD. METHODS: The authors compared clinical features, impulsive sensation seeking (ISS) personality traits, past experimental drug use, alcohol consumption, smoking behaviors, and depressive symptoms in 25 patients with DDS to an outpatient sample of 100 patients with PD who were not compulsively overusing dopaminergic medication. RESULTS: Patients with DDS had a significantly younger age at disease onset, higher dopaminergic drug intake, greater past experimental drug use, more depressive symptoms, scored higher on ISS ratings, and tended to have higher alcohol intake. Using logistic regression analysis, we found that novelty seeking personality traits, depressive symptoms, alcohol intake, and age at PD onset were significant predictors of DDS. CONCLUSIONS: These factors may help to identify early patients who are more vulnerable to developing a pattern of compulsive dopaminergic drug use and help minimize its consequences.",2005.0,10.1212/01.wnl.0000184487.72289.f0,ZAVTW74L,0,personality,1264
1264,Is hippocampal atrophy a future drug target?,"Dhikav, V.; Anand, K. S.","Hippocampus is the brain structure, vital for episodic and declarative memory. Atrophy of the human hippocampus is seen in a variety of psychiatric and neurological disorders e.g. recurrent depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, epilepsy, head injury, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Importantly, aging hippocampus also undergoes atrophy. In many instances, for example, AD, the atrophy precedes the development of symptoms while in others, there is a temporal relationship between atrophy and symptomatology. The presence of atrophied hippocampus is one of the most consistent features of many common psychiatric disorders. Several factors contribute to this atrophy. Stress is one of the most profound factors implicated and the mechanisms involve glucocorticoids, serotonin, excitatory amino acids etc. Hippocampal formation as a whole can undergo atrophy or its individual structural components e.g. apical dendrities can exhibit atrophy. Several drugs of unrelated classes have been shown to prevent atrophy indicating heterogenous manner in which hippocampal atrophy is produced. These include, tianeptine (affects structural plasticity in hippocampus and is an effective antidepressant); phenytoin (antiseizure and neuroprotective); fluoxetine (downregulates neurodegenerative enzyme and increases neuroprotective hippocampal S100beta); lithium (neuroprotective and antiapoptotic); tricyclic antidepressants (increase hippocampal neurogenesis); antipsychotics (reduce hippocampal neuronal suppression); sodium valproate (increases neurogenesis) and mifepristone (antioxidant, neuroprotective and anti-glucocorticoid). Now the most important question is: to what extent does the hippocampal atrophy play a role in the genesis of symptoms of diseases or their progression? And if it does, can we achieve the same degree of prevention or reversal seen in experimental animals, in humans also. An even more important question is: whether the prevention of atrophy would be clinically useful in affecting disease, viz slowing its progression, reducing morbidity, complications or positively affecting the outcome of one or more of its clinically important aspects. If the answer to this is yes, we would have to know at what stage of the disease we use the drugs, dose, duration, follow-up and efficacy. The use of these drugs in the above mentioned conditions can not only test the potential of atrophy as a future drug target, but could also help in learning more about the hippocampus in both health and diseases. \textcopyright 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The stressors to which refugees are exposed are described in three stages: (1) while in their country of origin; (2) during their flight to safety; and (3) when having to settle in a country of refuge. The evidence concerning the impact of displacement on children's mental health is reviewed and a framework for conceptualising the risk factors is proposed. The available literature shows consistently increased levels of psychological morbidity among refugee children, especially post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety disorders. The principles underlying the delivery of mental health care for these children are also considered. It is argued that much primary prevention can be undertaken in the school context. Some key aspects of British immigration law are examined and the tension between the law and the best interests of the child principle is discussed. There is particular concern for the plight of unaccompanied children. Attention to the mental health needs of this vulnerable group is urgently required.",2002.0,,5MXULXW7,0,diathesis,1266
1266,Physical illness and health-related behaviors following a cognitive-behavioral intervention.,"Buchanan, Gregory Mcclellan","One hundred and twenty entering freshmen, deemed to be at risk for depression on the basis of their explanatory style scores, were assigned to one of two conditions. Half of the subjects participated in an eight week cognitive-behavioral intervention designed to prevent future incidence of depression (Seminar Group). The other half served as no-intervention controls (Control Group). We assessed the physical health of these subjects 6-30 months after entry into the project. Subjects in the Seminar Group had better physical health than those in the Control Group. The Seminar subjects experienced fewer symptoms of physical illness; they reported having made fewer overall doctors visits; and, they made fewer illness visits to Student Health than did subjects in the Control Group. There was also evidence that Seminar subjects were taking better care of themselves. They took a more active stance to the symptoms they experienced; they were more likely to visit a doctor for a check-up; and they had healthier habits related to diet and exercise. These health effects were found to be mediated by depression, which in turn was found to be mediated by hopelessness. Both emotional and behavioral pathways were proposed to account for these relationships. The cognitive-behavioral intervention was successful in reducing symptoms of depression immediately after the intervention. We propose that, as a result of this reduction in symptoms, seminar subjects experienced fewer somatic symptoms of depression and did not suffer the immunosuppression consequences of depression. Additionally, the problem solving techniques taught in the seminar may have generalized to the health related behaviors leading the seminar subjects to take a proactive, rather than reactive, stance to their health.

1267,Davanloo's intensive short-term dynamic Psychotherapy in a tertiary psychotherapy service: Overall effectiveness and association between unlocking the unconscious and outcome,"Johansson, R.; Town, J. M.; Abbass, A.","Background: Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy (ISTDP), as developed by Habib Davanloo, is an intensive emotion-focused psychodynamic therapy with an explicit focus on handling resistance in treatment. A core assumption in ISTDP is that psychotherapeutic effects are dependent on in-session emotional processing in the form of rise in complex transference feelings that occurs when treatment resistance is challenged. Recent research indicates that an unlocking of the unconscious, a powerful emotional breakthrough achieved at a high rise in complex transference feelings, can potentially enhance ISTDP's effectiveness. While ISTDP has a growing evidence base, most of the research conducted has used small samples and has tested therapy delivered by expert therapists. The aims of this study were to evaluate the overall effectiveness of ISTDP when delivered in a tertiary psychotherapy service, and to investigate if having an unlocking of the unconscious during therapy predicted enhanced treatment effectiveness. Methods: A total of 412 patients were included in the analyses. The average length of treatment was 10.2 sessions (SD 13.3).Multilevel growth curve modeling was used to evaluate treatment effectiveness and the association between unlocking the unconscious and outcome. A number of control predictors including type of treatment resistance were selected and included in the analyses. Outcome measures were the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP). About half of the patients in the study were treated by therapists in training and the other half by more experienced therapists. Results: Growth curve analyses using the full intention-to-treat sample revealed significant within-group effects of ISTDP on both the BSI and the IIP. Effect sizes were large ( \textgreater 0.80). Unlocking the unconscious during therapy was associated with significantly larger treatment outcome. The relationship was further moderated by type of treatment resistance. Conclusion: This study adds to the empirical base of Davanloo's ISTDP with confirmed treatment effectiveness in a large-scale patient sample when ISTDP was delivered by therapists with a range of experience. Furthermore, emotional mobilization in the form of unlocking the unconscious was confirmed as a process factor enhancing the effectiveness of ISTDP.",2014.0,,7ISFIHVM,0,psychodynamic,1268

C.; Schneiter, P.; Tappy, L.","Objective: To compare the absorption of carbon-13 (13C) acetate-enriched nutrients with D-xylose absorption. Design: Prospective cohort observational study. Setting: Surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital. Patients: A total of 24 critically ill patients requiring enteral nutritional support. Intervention: The patients were divided into three groups according to the route of 13C acetate administration: 1) gastric, 2) jejunal, and 3) intravenous. D-xylose was administered via the same route as enteral nutrition. Measurements and Main Results: 13C acetate absorption and oxidation were reflected by pulmonary 13CO2 excretion. Breath 13CO2 isotopic enrichment was measured by mass spectrometry. 13C acetate absorption was rapid, and D-xylose absorption was depressed in all three groups, compared with the normal values (p \textless .0001). Breath 13CO2 isotopic enrichment was similar after intravenous and jejunal administration but slightly delayed during the first 240 mins after gastric administration (p \textless .01). Enteral feeding was well tolerated: mean energy delivery amounted to 77 \% , 88 \% , and 86 \% of measured resting energy expenditure on days 1-3. Conclusions: Gastric and jejunal 13C acetate are rapidly absorbed in critically ill surgical patients requiring enteral nutrition, contrasting with a depressed or delayed D-xylose absorption. 13CO2 recovery kinetics was similar after jejunal or intravenous 13C acetate and slightly depressed after gastric administration.

Two hundred forty-six men and women with painful diabetic neuropathy received pregabalin (150 or 600 mg/day by mouth) or placebo. The primary efficacy variable was mean pain score at the end of treatment. Efficacy results indicate that pregabalin 600 mg/day significantly decreased mean pain score to 4.3 (vs 5.6 for placebo, P = .0002) and increased the proportion of patients who had a \textgreater or =50 \% decrease from baseline pain (39 \% vs 15 \% for placebo, P = .002). Pregabalin also significantly reduced sleep interference, past week and present pain intensity, sensory and affective pain scores, and bodily pain and decreased by \textgreater or =50 \% the number of patients describing their pain as gnawing, sickening, fearful, and punishing-cruel. More patients receiving pregabalin 600 mg/day than placebo showed improvement, as rated on the Clinical and Patient Global Impression of Change scales, 73 \% vs 45 \% and 85 \% vs 47 \% , respectively. Pregabalin 150 mg/day was essentially no different from placebo. Dizziness was the most common side effect. These study results show pregabalin 600 mg/day to be safe and effective in reducing the pain and other associated symptoms of painful diabetic neuropathy.

The characteristic affective disturbance and impulsive aggression are linked to imbalances in the central serotonin system, and most of the genetic association studies focused on serotonergic candidate genes. However, the efficacy of dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) blocking antipsychotic drugs in BPD treatment also suggests involvement of the dopamine system in the neurobiology of BPD. METHODS: In the present study we tested the dopamine dysfunction hypothesis of impulsive self- and other-damaging behaviors: borderline and antisocial traits were assessed by Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis (SCID) for DSM-IV in a community-based US sample of 99 young adults from low-to-moderate income families. For the BPD trait analyses a second, independent group was used consisting of 136 Hungarian patients with bipolar or major depressive disorder filling out self-report SCID-II Screen questionnaire. In the genetic association analyses the previously indicated polymorphisms of the catechol-O-methyl-transferase (COMT Val158Met) and dopamine transporter (DAT1 40 bp VNTR) were studied. In addition, candidate polymorphisms of the DRD2 and DRD4 dopamine receptor genes were selected from the impulsive behavior literature. RESULTS: The DRD2 TaqI B1-allele and A1-allele were associated with borderline traits in the young adult sample (p = 0.001, and p = 0.005, respectively). Also, the DRD4 -616 CC genotype appeared as a risk factor (p = 0.02). With severity of abuse accounted for in the model, genetic effects of the DRD2 and DRD4 polymorphisms were still significant (DRD2 TaqIB: p = 0.001, DRD2 TaqIA: p = 0.008, DRD4 -616 C/G: p = 0.002). Only the DRD4 promoter finding was replicated in the independent sample of psychiatric inpatients (p = 0.007). No association was found with the COMT and DAT1 polymorphisms. CONCLUSIONS: Our results of the two independent samples suggest a possible involvement of the DRD4 -616 C/G promoter variant in the development of BPD traits. In addition, an association of the DRD2 genetic polymorphisms with impulsive self-damaging behaviors was also demonstrated.",2010.0,10.1186/1744-9081-6-4,798D6DFM,0,personality,1273

Certain negative life events (especially relationship problems and physical/mental abuse in childhood) turned out to be the main indicators of severe mental problems in the family of the attempters (e.g. addiction, self-destructive behavior or psychiatric hospitalization). Significant positive correlations were found between the number of events and some psychopathological symptoms like depression, hopelessness, anger and lack of self-esteem. The role of stressful life events in suicidal behavior is emphasized. Particularly traumatic events (e.g. abuse in childhood) may be involved in the development of psychological and/or biological vulnerability (stress-diathesis model) and cognitive dysfunction. Therefore, in the psychotherapy of suicide attempters, it is essential to explore and discuss negative life events. Copyright \textcopyright 2004 S.

To investigate the prevalence rate of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) comorbid psychiatric disorders and to explore psychotic symptoms in patients with combat-related current PTSD. Method. The sample included Croatian war veterans (N = 41) who were hospitalized at the University Department of Psychiatry of the Vrapce Psychiatric Hospital during the 1995-1996 period and fulfilled the DSM-TV criteria for the current and chronic PTSD. The Schedule for Affective Disorder and Schizophrenia (SADS-L) was applied for the assessment of current and lifetime psychiatric disorders. Only three subjects had a prewar Axis I psychiatric disorder. One third of the patients met the criteria for a personality disorder. Results. After severe combat trauma, the majority of PTSD patients (33/41) had at least one comorbid psychiatric diagnosis on Axis I. In those with personality disorders the most frequent was alcohol dependence, whereas in those without personality disorders it was major depressive disorder. Psychotic symptoms occurred in 8 out of 41 PTSD patients. None of them had a primary psychotic disorder or a personality disorder. In all patients the psychotic symptoms were different from flashbacks. They were symbolically related to the trauma and resistant to antipsychotic treatment. Psychotic symptoms were associated with depression in 5 out of 8 patients with psychotic symptoms. Conclusion.

In recent years, interest in addressing stress responsivity through meditation training in health-related domains has increased astoundingly, despite a paucity of evidence that reported benefits are specific to meditation practice. We designed the present study to rigorously compare an 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) intervention to a well-matched active control intervention, the Health Enhancement Program (HEP) in ability to reduce psychological stress and experimentally-induced inflammation. The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) was used to induce psychological stress and inflammation was produced using topical application of capsaicin cream to forearm skin. Immune and endocrine measures of inflammation and stress were collected both before and after MBSR training. Results show those randomized to MBSR and HEP training had comparable post-training stress-evoked cortisol responses, as well as equivalent reductions in self-reported psychological distress and physical symptoms. However, MBSR training resulted in a significantly smaller post-stress inflammatory response compared to HEP, despite equivalent levels of stress hormones. These results suggest behavioral interventions designed to reduce emotional reactivity may be of therapeutic benefit in chronic inflammatory conditions. Moreover, mindfulness practice, in particular, may be more efficacious in symptom relief than the well-being promoting activities cultivated in the HEP program.",2013.0,10.1016/j.bbi.2012.10.013,U9M3METR,0,diathesis,1276

Catastrophizing is often observed in anxiety, yet no prior study has controlled for anxiety when studying this cognitive risk factor for depression in the context of hopelessness theory. Results replicated previous findings amongst youth aged 7-13, such that a significant relationship was observed between depressive symptoms and catastrophizing; this relationship remained significant in the full sample after controlling for anxiety. However, the relationship between catastrophizing and depression differed by grade such that, after controlling for anxiety, catastrophizing was predictive of depressive symptoms amongst third-grade but not fifth- or seventh-grade children. The inclusion of the anxiety construct in hopelessness theory may enhance current conceptualizations of the changing nature of depression across development.

1277,Microbleeds in late-life depression: Comparison of early- and late-onset depression,"Feng, C.; Fang, M.; Xu, Y.; Hua, T.; Liu, X. Y.","Late-life depression could be classified roughly as early-onset depression (EOD) and late-onset depression (LOD). LOD was proved to be associated with cerebral lesions including white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and silent brain infarctions (SBI), differently from EOD. However, it is unclear whether similar association is present between LOD and microbleeds which are also silent lesions. In this study, 195 patients of late-life depression were evaluated and divided into EOD, presenile-onset depression (POD), and LOD groups; 85 healthy elderly controls were enrolled as controls. Subjects were scanned by MRI including susceptibility weighted images to evaluate white matter hyperintensities (WMH), silent brain infarctions (SBI), and microbleeds. The severity of depression was evaluated with 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale. Psychosocial factors were investigated with Scale of Life Events and Lubben Social Network Scale. Logistic regression and linear regression were performed to identify the independent risk factors for depression. Results showed that LOD patients had higher prevalence of microbleeds than EOD, POD, and control patients. The prevalence of lobar microbleeds and microbleeds in the left hemisphere was the independent risk factor for the occurrence of LOD; a high number of microbleeds were associated with severe state of LOD, whereas life events and lack of social support were more important for EOD and POD. All these results indicated that Microbleeds especially lobar microbleeds and microbleeds in the left hemisphere were associated with LOD but not with EOD. \textcopyright 2014 Chao Feng et al.",2014.0,10.1155/2014/682092,U6ZZSTLQ,0,diathesis,1278
1278,Psychological well-being in medical students during exam stress-influence of short-term practice of mind sound technology.,"H, Dayalan; S, Subramanian; T, Elango","INTRODUCTION: Medical education is perceived as stressful. As excessive stress hampers students' performance, stress management is required for medical students. This study was aimed to assess the effect of Mind Sound Technology (MST), an intelligence enhancing program, on psychological well-being of medical undergraduates during exam stress. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two medical students were recruited and Dukes Health Profile scoring was done at baseline and during Exam Stress (ES). After pre-intervention measurements, the students were randomized into two groups: non-practitioners and MST practitioners. Post-intervention measurement was done at the end of 6 weeks when the students had examination. RESULTS: Students showed a significant increase (P < 0.001) in negative health scores like perceived health scores, anxiety, and depression and a significant decrease (P < 0.001) in positive health scores like Self-Esteem, Mental Health Score, Social Health Score, and General Health Score during exam when compared with baseline. MST practice increased positive health scores (P < 0.001) and decreased perceived health score (P < 0.01), anxiety, depression, and anxiety-depression scores significantly (P < 0.001) when compared with ES score. Non practitioners did not show any significant change in any of the scores when compared with ES score. Six weeks of MST practice by medical students have improved the academic scores (P < 0.05) when compared with their non-practitioner counterpart. CONCLUSION: Thus, practice of MST has helped in coping up the stress that occurs during examination and improved academic performance in medical undergraduates.",2010.0,10.4103/0019-5359.102122,ZK2ZALGI,0,diathesis,1279
1279,Capability for suicide interacts with states of heightened arousal to predict death by suicide beyond the effects of depression and hopelessness.,"Ribeiro, Jessica D.; Yen, Shirley; Joiner, Thomas; Siegler, Ilene C.","Background: States of heightened arousal (e.g., agitation, sleep disturbance) have been repeatedly linked to suicidal thoughts and behaviors, including attempts and death. Studies have further indicated that these states may be particularly pernicious among individuals who evidence high suicidal capability. The objective of this study was to examine the interactive effects of heightened arousal and the capability for suicide in the prospective prediction of death by suicide. We examine this relation beyond the effects of robust predictors of suicide, namely depression and hopelessness. Methods: Participants were drawn from a larger study of undergraduates who completed baseline assessments during their freshman year and were then followed to time of death. The sample in this study only included individuals who had died by suicide (n = 96) or other causes (n = 542). Proxy measures to assess predictor variables were constructed using items from the MMPI, which was administered at baseline. An independent sample of clinical outpatients (n = was used to evaluate the construct validity of the proxy measures). Results: Results were in line with expectation: heightened arousal interacted with capability for suicide to prospectively predict death by suicide, such that, as severity of heightened arousal symptoms increased, the likelihood of death by suicide increased among individuals high but not low on capability for suicide. Limitations: Limitations include the use of proxy measures, the extended length of follow-up, and the homogeneity of the sample (i.e., primarily White males). Conclusion: These findings add to an emerging literature that supports the moderating influence of capability for suicide on the relationship between states of heightened arousal on the likelihood of death by suicide.

1280,Cognitive impairment in relapsing and primary progressive multiple sclerosis: Mostly a matter of speed.,"Denney, Douglas R.; Lynch, Sharon G.; Parmenter, Brett A.; Horne, Nikki","Based on the assumption that cognitive impairment in MS is consistent with subcortical dementia, a battery of neuropsychological tests was assembled that included measures of executive function (Tower of London and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test), verbal learning and memory (a paired associates learning test), and speeded information processing (Stroop Color Word Interference Test). The battery was administered to patients with relapsing and primary progressive MS and to healthy controls. Differences between patients and controls occurred on several of the measures. However, when differences with respect to fatigue and depression were statistically controlled, the only differences that remained significant involved measures relating to the speed of information processing. Patients performed more slowly than controls, with the disparity being greater for relapsing patients than for those with primary progressive disease. The slowing was evident on measures of automatic as well as controlled processing and regardless of whether speed was an explicit feature of successful performance or recorded unobstrusively while the patient concentrated on planning a correct solution to a problem. Parallels were noted between cognitive slowing associated with MS and that of normal aging. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",,,KZC42XF8,0,cognitive,1281

P.","Numerous investigators have examined the role of negative affective states and affect regulation in the initiation and development of cigarette smoking behavior, smoking cessation, and relapse prevention. Affect regulation refers to any attempt to alleviate negative mood states by means of pharmacologic-, cognitive-, behavioral- or environmental-change methods. The psychological construct/process of affect regulation is examined in relation to (1) the initiation, development, and maintenance of the cigarette smoking habit; (2) the process of quitting smoking; and (3) the long-term maintenance of smoking abstinence versus relapse. Various psychosocial factors and physiological mechanisms are explored that have been hypothesized to be links between negative mood states, nicotine addiction, and smoking cessation. Implications for smoking cessation treatment are discussed in the areas of (1) the use of pharmacologic agents, such as clonidine, in the reduction of nicotine withdrawal symptoms; (2) nicotine replacement therapy; and (3) skills-training approaches to smoking cessation and relapse prevention.",1992.0,10.1080/02791072.1989.10472175,GTRD5AXB,0,cognitive,1282
1282,The psychological consequences of cardiopulmonary resuscitation training for family members of patients at risk for sudden death,"Dracup, K.; Moser, D. K.; Taylor, S. E.; Guzy, P. M.","The pH dependence of the apparent tetramer to dimer dissociation constant has been determined at 20 degrees for both oxy- and deoxyhemoglobins A and Kansas. These measurements were made by three different procedures: gel chromatography, sedimentation velocity, and kinetic methods in either of three buffer systems: 0.05 M cacodylate, Tris, or glycine with 1 mM EDTA and 0.1 M NaCl between pH 6.5 and 11. The tetramer-dimer dissociation constant of human oxyhemoglobin A decreases from about 3.2 X 10(-6) M at pH 6.0 to about 3.2 X 10(-8) M at pH 8.5. The slope of this line indicates that the dissociation of tetramer to dimer is accompanied by the uptake of about 0.6 protons per mol of tetramer in this region. The corresponding dissociation constant for deoxyhemoglobin in the same pH region increases apparently almost linearly from 1.0 x 10(-12) M at pH 6.5 to about 1.0 x 10(-5) M at pH 11. To dimer is associated with the release of about 1.6 protons per mol of tetramer. Comparison of these data with the known proton release accompanying the oxygenation of tetramers confirms that the pH dependence of oxygen binding by dimers must be very small. The present data predict that the overall proton release or uptake per oxygen bound by dimer should be less than 0.1. The tetramer-dimer dissociation equilibria of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobins above pH 8.5 have identical pH dependences. In this range the dissociation constant of deoxy-Hb is about one-tenth that of oxyhemoglobin. Human oxyhemoglobin Kansas is known to have an enhanced tetramer-dimer dissociation compared with that of hemoglobin A. Below pH 8.5 the tetramer-dimer dissociation constant of Hb Kansas is about 400 times greater than that of HbA in the absence of phosphate buffers. In contrast, the tetramer-dimer dissociation constants of deoxyhemoglobins A and Kansas appear to be identical. These findings are consistent with previous structural observations on these hemoglobins. The data on the tetramer-dimer dissociation of human hemoglobin were used to calculate the total free energy of binding of oxygen to the tetramer and the median oxygen pressure on the basis of fundamental linkage relations and a pH-independent estimate of the total free energy of binding oxygen to dimer. Simulated oxygen binding curves were generated with the equations of Ackers and Halvorson (Ackers, G. K., and Halvorson, H. (1974) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 71, 4312-4316) by making two assumptions: (a) that the dimers are noncooperative and pH-independent in O2 binding and (b) that the distribution of cooperative energy in the oxygenation of tetramers is independent of pH. We have compared these simulations with experimental data obtained at low protein concentrations (30 to 124 muM heme) to show that the variation in oxygen affinity with pH can be described in terms of the subunit equilibria. We conclude that an accurate analysis of the contributions of individual oxygen binding steps to the Bohr effect cannot be made without considering the contributions of the dimers to oxygen binding...",1997.0,,A5SNJRWG,0,behavior,1283

K.; Naranjo, C. A.; Shear, N. H.","Background: This study examined the effectiveness of antidepressants in a group of elderly depressed outpatients by assessing depression prevalence and recording adverse events over time. Method: A prospective practice-based observational study (1991 - 1994) included consecutive outpatients at least 65 years of age with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of major affective disorder and who were prescribed antidepressant medications. Depressive symptoms were examined over time (stage 1 = 0 to 2 months; stage 2 = 2 to 6 months; stage 3 = 6 months to 2 years) with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). The cutoff scores of MADRS \textless 18 and MADRS ≥ 18 were used in survival statistics. Adverse events were recorded systematically. Results: A total of 213 patients were seen over 2677 visits (mean ± SD age = 75.5 ± 6.1 years). MADRS scores for 85.8 \% of patients declined to below 18 within the first 2 months of antidepressant treatment. MADRS scores were above 18 for 37.3 \% of patients after 6 months and for 37.1 \% after 2 years. The mean time to decline in MADRS scores to below 18 in stage 1 was 36.1 days, and there was a significant difference between the antidepressant classes (log rank = 8.3, df = 3, p = .04), with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)/reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (RIMAs) having shorter times to response. The mean time to reach scores above cutoff during stage 2 was 144.3 days (log rank = 5.7, df= 3, p = .13) and during stage 3, 538.6 days (log rank = 9.8, df = 3, p = .02). Patients receiving TCAs and MAOIs/RIMAs had longer durations of MADRS scores below cutoff during stage 3 than those taking atypical antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. All antidepressant classes reported similar adverse event profiles. Conclusion: This study systematically examined antidepressant effectiveness in a prospective design.

The specific aims were to describe the outcomes, test feasibility of the study design, and evaluate effect size. Design and Methods: A randomized experimental design was used in a sample of 42 patients who received multicomponent treatment intervention (NRT) or standard care (SC) in a midwestern city in the United States. Variables were behavioral (quit rate, self-efficacy, motivation), psychosocial (depression, partner interaction), and symptom management (use of nicotine replacement therapy [NRT]). Data analysis included descriptive statistics and repeated measures ANOVA. Results: The typical participant was Caucasian, middle aged, nicotine dependent, married or partnered, and employed, and had a high school education. Participants in the NRT group were more likely to use NET and to have higher self-reported quit rates at follow-up. Statistically significant differences were found between groups over time for self-efficacy and positive to negative behavior ratio. Barriers to quitting were relapse, stress, weight gain, lack of support, and depression that were more frequent in the SC group. For effect size (0.25), probability level (.05), and power (.80), a sample size of 140 patients was calculated. Conclusions: The MTI group had higher quit rates, more NRT, higher self-efficacy, and more positive behavioral interactions. Limitations of the study included self-report of tobacco use, small sample, and attrition. The investigators suggest a future study with a larger sample to test whether multicomponent interventions with telephone calls after discharge are more effective than is standard care in helping patients to quit and continue to abstain from smoking.

A.; Subramaniam, M.","Background \& Hypothesis: Stigma relating to mental illness is a global issue and often results from misunderstandings, negative stereotypes and perceptions society has about mental illness, frequently resulting in negative outcomes for people with mental illness. Internalised stigma specifically refers to the devaluation, shame, secrecy and withdrawal triggered by applying negative stereotypes to oneself. This study describes the correlates of internalised stigma among outpatients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey among outpatients (n = 220) aged 21 to 65 years who were seeking treatment at the Institute of Mental Health or Community Wellness Clinics. Respondents were administered the Internalised Stigma of Mental Illness Scale, along with other measures and sociodemographic information was also obtained. Analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA and multiple linear regression models. Results: The majority of the sample was male (52.3 \% ), single (58 \% ) and currently working (52.3 \% ). The mean age (SD) of respondents was 39.9 (11.1) years with more Chinese (45.4 \% ) than Malays (27.3 \% ) and Indians (27.3 \% ). Internalised stigma was significantly lower among those with anxiety disorders compared to those with OCD (62.4 vs 72.9, P \textless 0.01) and depressive disorders (62.4 vs 69.7, P \textless 0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that sociodemographic correlates had no significant association with internalised stigma. Discussion \& Conclusion: These findings highlight important disease-specific differences in internalised stigma among a group of treatment-seeking outpatients with mental illness. There is a need to identify and develop tailored interventions to reduce stigma particularly among those with depressive disorders and OCD.",2015.0,,GZZQ3WGL,0,psychodynamic,1286

Results show that sociological and psychological constructs were not good predictors of response to treatment. The score on the Affective Inhibition Scale of the IBQ was predictive of the duration of a positive response to treatment, and was associated with pain relief, lasting up to 24 hrs. The severity of pain and its role as part of a psychological coping strategy were related to the response to local treatment of myofascial pain syndrome.

J.","Objective: To examine symptom change over time, the effect of attrition on treatment outcome, and the putative mediators of cognitive therapy (CT) versus behavior therapy (BT) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) using archival data. Method: Sixty-two adults with OCD were randomized to 20 sessions of CT (N = 30) or BT (N = 32) that consisted of 4 weeks of intensive treatment (16 hr total) and 12 weeks of maintenance sessions (4 hr). Independent evaluators assessed OCD severity using the Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) at baseline and at Weeks 4, 16 (posttreatment), 26, and 52 (follow-up). Behavioral avoidance, depressive symptoms, and dysfunctional beliefs regarding responsibility were also measured at each assessment. Study hypotheses were tested using multilevel modeling. Results: The slope of change in Y-BOCS scores was significantly greater in BT than in CT (d = 0.69), and those receiving BT had lower Y-BOCS scores at the final assessment than those receiving CT (d = 1.17). The greater slope of change in BT versus CT did not differ for dropouts versus completers. Reduction in depressed mood mediated changes in Y-BOCS across the 2 treatments, but a reduction in sense of responsibility and a decrease in avoidance did not. Instead, Y-BOCS improvements appeared to precede a decrease in avoidance. Conclusions: BT may have some therapeutic advantage over CT in the treatment of OCD, and this advantage does not appear to be due to a differential pattern of responding for treatment dropouts versus completers. Further, inconsistent with hypotheses, improvements in OCD symptoms were mediated by reductions in depressed mood instead of decreases in avoidance and responsibility.

Under these circumstances, knowledge about predictors is essential for the clinician in order to make reliable treatment recommendations. The primary aim of this study was to investigate clinical, demographic, and therapy process-related predictors of Internet-based CBT for severe health anxiety. We performed three types of analyses on data from a sample comprising participants (N = 81) who had received Internet-based CBT in a randomized controlled trial. Outcomes were a) end state health anxiety, b) improvement in health anxiety (continuous change scores), and c) clinically significant improvement. Outcomes were assessed at six-month follow-up. The results showed that the most stable predictors of both end state health anxiety and improvement were baseline health anxiety and depressive symptoms. Treatment adherence, i.e. the number of completed treatment modules, also significantly predicted outcome. Notably, health anxiety at baseline was positively associated with symptom improvement while depressive symptoms was negatively related to improvement. Demographic factors were largely without significant impact on end state symptoms or improvement.

Previous research has shown an increased risk of attempted suicide associated with a homosexual orientation. However, the mechanisms underlying this increased risk are not yet clear. This study therefore aimed to determine the risk of attempted suicide and the effect of potential risk factors on the occurrence of suicidal ideation and behaviour among homosexual youngsters. METHODS: The association between suicidal ideation and behaviour and potential risk factors was assessed by means of a questionnaire in a general population sample of homosexual or bisexual young people and a control sample consisting of school pupils. RESULTS: A twofold increased risk of suicidal ideation was found associated with a homosexual or bisexual orientation. A significantly increased risk of attempted suicide associated with homosexuality or bisexuality was found in females. Independent of sexual orientation, depression was identified as a significant risk factor for suicidal ideation, while suicidal behaviour was associated with low self-esteem, higher levels of hopelessness and suicidal behaviour in someone close. Among homosexual or bisexual young people, less satisfying homosexual friendships were an additional risk factor for suicidal behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: The identified increased risk of suicidal ideation among homosexual or bisexual young people is associated with depression and may lead to suicidal behaviour, independent of sexual orientation, especially in the presence of a role model of suicidal behaviour, and among those with unsatisfying friendships.",2000.0,,CY3A9R64,0,cognitive,1291

The denaturation properties (the free energy and the stoichiometry of denaturative interaction) are highly dependent on pH values. The data obtained indicate that the hydrophobic interactions are the determining forces in the stabilization process of the beta-lactoglobulin molecule. The relative contribution of these interactions lowers with pH rise. The denaturation of beta-lactoglobulin AB proceeds through two stages under conditions when the protein octamer exists. Up to 30 vol.% of ethanol and dioxane, the penetration of the organic molecules into the external parts of the protein globule takes place. At the concentration of the solvent exceeding 50 vol.% structural transitions are observed. The comparison of fluorescence and perturbation spectral data enables one to localise tryptophan residues in the protein more precisely. The results of this and former reports lead to hypothesis that beta-lactoglobulin may serve as a transporter of some substances which are unstable to acidic media.",2008.0,10.1080/10705500802365508,NDLE94XS,0,behavior,1292
1292,When wolves fall from the sky: Using R-PAS in early detection of psychosis in an adolescent,"Kleiger, James H.; Khadivi, Ali","Early detection of psychotically vulnerable patients has attracted a great deal of interest among diagnosticians and researchers. Researchers argue that the neuropathological processes associated with the onset of psychosis appear long before the appearance of identifiable psychotic symptoms. With an eye on early detection and intervention, clinical researchers have sought to identify vulnerable patients and prevent or minimize the traumatic effects of a first psychotic episode and the poor prognosis associated with late identification and delayed treatment. With secondary prevention at stake, researchers have developed operational criteria and assessment tools to identify clinical characteristics that precede an initial psychotic episode. The Rorschach, conducted according R-PAS procedures, detected impaired reality testing and a severe disturbance in Chandra's thinking that neither the parents nor clinicians had picked up. The fact that these adults in close contact with Chandra did not identify the severity of her thought disorder and disturbed reality testing was understandable, given her lack of peculiar language and the absence of florid psychotic symptoms. Essentially, R-PAS identified what was being masked by Chandra's and her sister's provocative behavior. After all, it was first Delsia's and then Chandra's dramatic behavior that drew all of the attention. Furthermore, Chandra was not complaining of significant depression or anxiety. Most importantly, despite her endorsement of positive symptoms of psychosis on the PAI-A (SCZ-P), she denied many of these experiences when questioned directly in a face-to-face interview format. Thus, one can see how her psychotherapist and psychiatrist might have overlooked more subtle signs of an emerging psychosis. This case also illustrates that in differential diagnosis, especially with adolescents and young adults, one must first rule out psychosis before considering other diagnosis. In conclusion, the psychodiagnostic process with Chandra underscored the value of psychological assessment, and R-PAS in particular, in helping identify psychoticlevel phenomena and their treatment implications. Recalling Appelbaum's findings from the Menninger Psychotherapy Research Program, psychological testing was found to be a more potent predictor of diagnosis and treatment outcome than either the clinical interview or the psychosocial history.

Taking parental status into account, the study examined whether age, education, perceived social support, locus of control, impact of stressful life events, activity level and perceived satisfaction with work, moderated the relationship between occupational status during pregnancy and psychological well-being post-partum. The results showed that employment status only explains depression in multiparous women. Social support, internal locus of control, decreased impact of life events and increased activity during pregnancy have a beneficial effect on depression of both multiparous and primiparous women. Giving up work during pregnancy did not appear to differentiate between the two groups of women in terms of depression.

Mothers in group I had hospitalization with their preterm infants in an individual room in the NICU. Mothers in group II were not hospitalized but had opportunity to visit their babies and spend time with them whenever they wanted. On the postdischarge third month, mothers were assessed for parental stress, postpartum depression, and perception of vulnerability.

1296,Non-invasive PET imaging of brain inflammation at disease onset predicts spontaneous recurrent seizures and reflects comorbidities,"Bertoglio, D.; Verhaeghe, J.; Santermans, E.; Amhaoul, H.; Jonckers, E.; Wyffels, L.; Van Der Linden, A.; Hens, N.; Staelens, S.; Dedeurwaerdere, S.","Brain inflammation is an important factor in the conversion of a healthy brain into an epileptic one, a phenomenon known as epileptogenesis, offering a new entry point for prognostic tools. The development of anti-epileptogenic therapies to treat before or at disease onset is hampered by our inability to predict the severity of the disease outcome. In a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy we aimed to assess whether in vivo non-invasive imaging of brain inflammation at disease onset was predictive of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) frequency and severity of depression-like and sensorimotor-related comorbidities. To this end, translocator protein, a biomarker of inflammation, was imaged by means of positron emission tomography (PET) 2 and 4 weeks post-status epilepticus using [18F]-PBR111. Translocator protein was highly upregulated 2 weeks post-status epilepticus in limbic structures (up to 2.1-fold increase compared to controls in temporal lobe, P < 0.001), whereas 4 weeks post-status epilepticus, upregulation decreased (up to 1.6-fold increase compared to controls in temporal lobe, P < 0.01) and was only apparent in a subset of these regions. Animals were monitored with video-electroencephalography during all stages of disease (acute, latent – first seizures appearing around 2 weeks post-status epilepticus – and chronic phases), for a total of 12 weeks, in order to determine SRS frequency for each subject (range 0.00–0.83 SRS/day). We found that regional PET uptake at 2 and 4 weeks post-status epilepticus correlated with the severity of depression-like and sensorimotor-related comorbidities during chronic epilepsy (P < 0.05 for each test). Regional PET imaging did not correlate with SRS frequency, however, by applying a multivariate data-driven modeling approach based on translocator protein PET imaging at 2 weeks post-status epilepticus, we accurately predicted the frequency of SRS (R = 0.92; R2 = 0.86; P < 0.0001) at the onset of epilepsy. This study not only demonstrates non-invasive imaging of translocator protein as a prognostic biomarker to ascertain SRS frequency, but also shows its capability to reflect the severity of depression-like and sensorimotor-related comorbidities. Our results are an encouraging step towards the development of anti-epileptogenic treatments by providing early quantitative assessment of SRS frequency and severity of comorbidities with high clinical relevance.",2017.0,10.1016/j.bbi.2016.12.015,JNQDSN55,0,additional,1297

Patients treated with medication but withdrawn onto pill-placebo had more relapse through 1 year of follow-up compared to patients who received prior behavioral activation, prior cognitive therapy, or continued medication. Prior psychotherapy was also superior to medication withdrawal in the prevention of recurrence across the 2nd year of follow-up. Specific comparisons indicated that patients previously exposed to cognitive therapy were significantly less likely to relapse following treatment termination than patients withdrawn from medication, and patients previously exposed to behavioral activation did almost as well relative to patients withdrawn from medication, although the difference was not significantly different. Differences between behavioral activation and cognitive therapy were small in magnitude and not significantly different across the full 2-year follow-up, and each therapy was at least as efficacious as the continuation of medication. These findings suggest that behavioral activation may be nearly as enduring as cognitive therapy and that both psychotherapies are less expensive and longer lasting alternatives to medication in the treatment of depression. \textcopyright 2008 American Psychological Association.",2008.0,10.1037/0022-006X.76.3.468,XHLZNSWJ,0,behavior,1298

W.; Wang, Y.; Dong, Q.; Chen, X.; Li, Y. S.; Zhou, Y.; Gao, L.; Deng, Y.; Xu, Q.","Background: Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is the common cause of cognitive decline in the old population. MRI can be used to clarify its mechanisms. However, the surrogate markers of MRI for early cognitive impairment in SVD remain uncertain to date. We investigated the cognitive impacts of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and brain volumetric measurements in a cohort of post-stroke non-dementia SVD patients. Methods: Fifty five non-dementia SVD patients were consecutively recruited and categorized into two groups as no cognitive impairment (NCI) (n = 23) or vascular mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI) (n = 32). Detailed neuropsychological assessment and multimodal MRI were completed. Results: The two groups differed significantly on Z scores of all cognitive domains (all p < 0.01) except for the language. There were more patients with hypertension (p = 0.038) or depression (p = 0.019) in the VaMCI than those in the NCI group. Multiple regression analysis of cognition showed periventricular mean diffusivity (MD) (β =-0.457, p < 0.01) and deep CMBs numbers (β =-0.352, p < 0.01) as the predictors of attention/executive function, which explained 45.2% of the total variance. Periventricular MD was the independent predictor for either memory (β =-0.314, p < 0.05) or visuo-spatial function (β =-0.375, p < 0.01); however, only small proportion of variance could be accounted for (9.8% and 12.4%, respectively). Language was not found to be correlated with any of the MRI parameters. No correlation was found between brain atrophic indices and any of the cognitive measures. Conclusion: Arteriosclerotic CMBs and periventricular white matter disintegrity seem to be independent MRI surrogated markers in the early stage of cognitive impairment in SVD.",2017.0,10.1017/S1041610216002118,PMZMRNH9,0,additional,1299
1299,"Relationship between economic stress factors and stress, anxiety, and depression: Moderating role of social support","Viseu, Joao; Leal, Rita; de Jesus, Saul Neves; Pinto, Patricia; Pechorro, Pedro; Greenglass, Esther","The economic crisis had a detrimental impact on the economies of several European countries, namely in Portugal. The literature emphasizes that periods of economic turmoil potentiate the appearance of mental health issues, such as stress, anxiety, and depression, and decrease populations' well-being. The present study, conducted in Portugal, was performed with a sample of 729 individuals, 33.9% males and 66.1% females, with an average age of 36.99 years old. Its' aim was to assess the relationship between economic stress factors (economic hardship, financial threat, and financial well-being) and stress, anxiety, and depression, as well as to test the moderating effect of social support on this relationship. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine the relationships defined. When comparing the results obtained in the models without and with social support as a moderator, statistically significant differences were observed on the relationships between financial threat and depression and between economic hardship and stress, anxiety, and depression. Regarding the association between financial threat and stress and anxiety, the effect of the economic stressor decreased in the presence of social support, but the differences were not statistically significant. The implications of these results are discussed and strategies to foster social support are proposed.

Ainsworth et al (1978) strange-situation assessment of attachment security with high-social-risk infants and toddlers, which show patterns of response that do not fit the A-B-C classification system developed by Ainsworth et al. Instead D or A/C Ss were found who came from problematic childrearing environments. Data on 44 insecurely attached 13-mo-olds from a high-social-risk sample were analyzed to test these findings. Ss' 16-29 yr old mothers completed measures of life experiences, difficult life circumstances, symptoms, social support and partner involvements, and personal resources and the Beck Depression Inventory. Analyses confirmed the general findings of the recent studies. The families of the 13 A/C infants were experiencing significantly more difficult life circumstances, more illness symptoms, and less social support as compared with the families of the 31 infants who received other insecure classifications. It is suggested that environmental and psychosocial stressors diminish parents' capacity to foster secure attachments in children.

Barr; Thomson, Aileen","BACKGROUND: Despite the growth of reduced therapist-contact cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) programmes, there have been few systematic attempts to determine prescriptive indicators for such programmes vis-a-vis more standard forms of CBT delivery. The present study aimed to address this in relation to brief (6-week) and standard (12-week) therapist-directed CBT for panic disorder (PD) with and without agoraphobia. Higher baseline levels of severity and associated disability/co-morbidity were hypothesized to moderate treatment effects, in favour of the 12-week programme. METHOD: Analyses were based on outcome data from two out of three treatment groups (n=72) from a recent trial of three forms of CBT delivery for PD. The dependent variables were a continuous composite panic/anxiety score and a measure of clinical significance. Treatment x predictor interactions were examined using multiple and logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: As hypothesized, higher baseline severity, disability or co-morbidity as indexed by strength of dysfunctional agoraphobic cognitions; duration of current episode of PD; self-ratings of panic severity; and the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) (Mental component) score were all found to predict poorer outcome with brief CBT. A similar trend was apparent in relation to baseline level of depression. With high and low end-state functioning as the outcome measure, however, only the treatment x agoraphobic cognitions interaction was found to be significant. CONCLUSIONS: While there was no evidence that the above variables necessarily contraindicate the use of brief CBT, they were nevertheless associated with greater overall levels of post-treatment improvement with the 12-week approach.",2007.0,10.1017/S0033291707000682,S594S7GT,0,behavior,1302
1302,The use of ECT and MST in treating depression.,"Allan, Charlotte L.; Ebmeier, Klaus P.","Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been used clinically since 1938. Its most common use is in the treatment of depression: first line treatment where rapid recovery is a priority, but more frequently as an effective treatment for patients who do not respond to pharmacological and psychological approaches. Whilst it is widely hailed as an effective treatment, concerns about its effect on cognition remain. The development of magnetic seizure therapy (MST) over the past decade has attempted to devise a therapy with comparable efficacy to ECT, but without the associated cognitive side effects. The rationale for this is that MST uses magnetic fields to induce seizures in the cortex, without electrical stimulation of brain structures involved with memory. MST has been used successfully in the treatment of depression, yet there is a dearth of literature in comparison with ECT. We present a systematic review of the literature on ECT (from 2009-2011) and MST (from 2001-2011).",2011.0,10.3109/09540261.2011.614223,D54U4S2W,0,cognitive,1303

However, abnormalities in specific brain structures and their interconnections may confer vulnerability to the development of late-life depression. The objective of this study was to identify subtle white matter abnormalities in late-life depression. DESIGN: The authors used magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) imaging, a technique that is thought primarily to reflect myelin integrity, to examine the hypothesis that individuals with late-life depression would exhibit white matter abnormalities in frontostriatal and limbic regions. SETTING: The study was conducted in a university-based, geriatric psychiatry clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-five older patients with major depression and 24 elderly comparison subjects were assessed. MEASUREMENT: Voxel-based analysis of MTR data were conducted with a general linear model using age as a covariate. RESULTS: Relative to comparison subjects, patients demonstrated lower MTR in multiple left hemisphere frontostriatal and limbic regions, including white matter lateral to the lentiform nuclei, dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal, dorsal anterior cingulate, subcallosal, periamygdalar, insular, and posterior cingulate regions. Depressed patients had lower MTR in additional left hemisphere locales including the thalamus, splenium of the corpus callosum, inferior parietal, precuneus, and middle occipital white matter regions. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that geriatric depression may be characterized by reduced myelin integrity in specific aspects of frontostriatal and limbic networks, and complement diffusion tensor studies of geriatric depression that indicate decreased organization of white matter fibers in specific frontal and temporal regions.",2008.0,10.1097/JGP.0b013e3181602a66,GYACXN95,0,cognitive_additional,1304
1304,The effects of acute exercise on cognitions related to depression.,"Lash, Julia M.","Exercise is known to improve mood and reduce depression. However, the mechanism(s) responsible for the antidepressent effects of exercise are not known. Cognitive therapy, one of the most effective psychological treatments of depression, is based on the assumption that changes in a person's negative thoughts will result in a remission of depression. The purpose of this study was to determine if a similar change in cognitions might occur with exercise. Self-report measures of mood (Profile of Mood States and Visual Analog Mood Scale) and depressive cognitions (Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire, Beck Self-Concept Test and Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale) were measured before and after a 25-minute session of treadmill walking in women presenting with symptoms of clinical depression. Following exercise, overall mood was improved and depression was reduced. In addition, depressive cognitions (automatic thoughts and dysfunctional attitudes) were significantly reduced and self-concept was improved. The magnitude of the mood change was proportional to the change in depressive cognitions, and was greatest in those with the most seven initial symptoms. While it cannot be concluded that exercise reduces depression by altering cognitions, the results clearly demonstrate that a single exercise session can improve mood and reduce depressive cognitions in depressed and dysthymic women.

Specifically, past research has failed to examine the affective-cognitive consistency (ACC) of job attitudes and the implications this has for the strength of the attitude and its relationship with behavior (e.g., job performance). Results from Study 1 suggest ACC is a significant moderator of the job satisfaction-job performance relationship, with those employees higher in ACC showing a significantly larger correlation between job satisfaction and performance than those lower in ACC.

This study was designed to test whether the use of BIS monitoring reduces the anaesthetic requirements during off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). This prospective - clinical trial was conducted on 40 adult patients undergoing elective off-pump CABG. Patients received either isoflurane or propofol anaesthesia. BIS monitoring, which guided the dose of anaesthetic, was carried out in 50 percent of the patients. The amount of anaesthetic agent (isoflurane or propofol) administered from the start of anaesthesia to the end of surgical procedure was calculated and were compared in four groups of patients - namely Group A (I-no BIS) received isoflurane; end tidal concentration was maintained at 1-1.2 \ \% \ in a low flow technique throughout the procedure, Group B (I-BIS) received isoflurane in a low flow technique; inspired concentration was dictated by BIS value maintained at 50; Group C (P-no BIS) received propofol at a dose range of 4-8 mg/kg/hr and in Group D(P-BIS) the propofol infusion rate was dictated by BIS value maintained at 50. The quantity of isoflurane was significantly less for Group B (I-BIS) as compared with Group A (I-no BIS) (37 +/- 4 vs. 24 +/- 4 ml; p \ \textless \ 0.05) and similarly the amount of propofol infused was significantly less in Group D (P-BIS) as compared with Group C (P-no BIS) (176 +/- 9 vs. 120 +/- 6 ml; p \ \textless \ 0.05). BIS guided anaesthesia reduces the anaesthetic agent required for the performance of off-pump CABG.

1309,Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester-based proliferative assays for assessment of T cell function in the diagnostic laboratory,"Fulcher, D. A.; Wong, S. W. J.","Immune deficiency diseases are often accompanied by abnormalities in one or both arms of the specific immune system. Impairment can often be detected as a decrease in the number of T or B lymphocytes or their products in the circulation, but questions are often asked as to the functional capabilities oft lymphocytes in patients with recurrent infections. Function of T cells has traditionally been measured by their uptake of [3H]thymidine following stimulation with antigen or mitogen in vitro. However, the ability of carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) to label lymphocytes intracellularly and track their mitotic activity by progressive twofold reduction in fluorescence intensity prompted an alternative methodology based on flow cytometry, an approach which has the advantage of allowing specific gating on particular T cell subsets and simultaneous assessment of activation markers. This method was therefore evaluated for T cell responses to mitogen and antigen. Phytohaemagglutinin-induced blast transformation of CFSE- labelled T cells was reflected by an increase in forward and orthogonal light scatter and a progressive two-fold decrease in CFSE fluorescence intensity. These changes allowed the derivation of various measures of mitotic activity, which correlated well with [3H]-thymidine uptake. Patients with T cell functional deficiencies showed impairment in their responses by both assays, whereas the CFSE-based assay demonstrated that impaired blastogenesis was not simply due to depressed T cell numbers. Concomitant measurement of the activation markers CD69 and CD25 showed that CD69 was rapidly expressed on non-mitotic cells and that this expression was progressively diluted with subsequent rounds of cell division. In contrast, CD25 expression was unaffected by cell cycle, but was expressed in proportion to the PHA dose. Antigen-specific responsiveness to Candida was also assessed using a CFSE- based assay. Initial gating on the relatively minor population of T cells that underwent blast transformation demonstrated progressive twofold dilutions of CFSE intensity in responsive cells. These normal Candida responses, found in patients who had recovered from Candida infection, contrasted with those who had not been infected with Candida or who had chronic recurrent infection, in whom neither blast transformation nor significant mitosis could be detected. Again, there was good correlation with [3H]-thymidine uptake. The CFSE-based assays are equivalent to traditional measures of mitogen-and antigen-specific T cell responsiveness in the diagnostic laboratory and have significant advantages in terms of decreased labour intensiveness, avoidance of radioactivity, the ability to gate on a specific population of lymphocytes and the concomitant measurement of activation markers.",1999.0,10.1046/j.1440-1711.1999.00870.x,V2S3AI53,0,cognitive_additional,1310

METHODS: Eighty women who met DSM-IV criteria for borderline personality disorder were randomly assigned either to the internet-based psychoeducation treatment group (n = 40) or to the internet-based control group with no psychoeducation (n = 40). Recruitment was conducted from July 2013 to March 2015. Subjects participated in 15 assessment periods that were divided into an acute phase (weeks 1-12) and a maintenance phase (months 6, 9, and 12). Main outcomes were assessed using the Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder. RESULTS: In the acute phase, women in the treatment group were found to have a significant decline in their scores on all 10 outcomes studied, while women in the control group had a significant decline on 7 of these outcomes. Two between-group differences were found to be significant-those in the treatment group reported a significantly greater decline in their impulsivity (z = -1.98, P = .048) and a significantly greater increase in their psychosocial functioning (z = -1.97, P = .049) than those in the control group. In the maintenance phase, those in the treatment group were found to have a significant decline in their scores on 9 of the 10 outcomes studied, while those in the control group had a significant decline in 3 of these outcomes. In terms of between-group differences, those in the treatment group reported a significantly greater decline in all 5 studied areas of borderline psychopathology: affective symptoms (z = -2.31, P = .021), cognitive symptoms (z = -3.20, P = .001), impulsivity (z = -2.44, P = .015), interpersonal difficulties (z = -2.15, P = .032), and overall borderline personality disorder symptoms (z = -2.11, P = .035).

However, it remains unknown whether anxious or avoidant attachment is linked to more general differences in emotional processing for negative and positive stimuli, and whether such differences depend on stimulus content. Here we tested how social or non-social positive or negative emotional scenes were rated for pleasantness, arousal, and control, as a function of individual attachment style, in a sample of 54 female participants. Our results show that avoidant attachment was associated with a selective reduction of pleasantness ratings for positive social images, whereas anxious attachment was associated with higher arousal and lower control ratings for negative social images, besides higher arousal ratings for all remaining stimulus categories. These findings reveal that adult attachment style is associated with differences in the perception of emotion-laden stimuli, even when unfamiliar and not directly attachment-related, and such differences may also affect positive scenes, particularly when they contain social information, rather than just socially negative or threatening information. In addition, our results support the notion that anxious attachment is not only associated with hyperactivating tendency during the appraisal of social threat, but may also involve an ambivalence influencing the judgments of both positive and negative information.

This study examined whether functional connectivity at rest (FC) within these networks characterizes late-life depression and predicts antidepressant response. METHODS: 26 non-demented, non-MCI older adults were studied. Of these, 16 had major depression and 10 had no psychopathology. Depressed patients were treated with escitalopram (target dose 20 mg) for 12 weeks after a 2-week placebo phase. Resting state time series was determined prior to treatment. FC within the CCN was determined by placing seeds in the dACC and the DLPFC bilaterally. FC within the DMN was assessed from a seed placed in the posterior cingulate. RESULTS: Low resting FC within the CCN and high resting FC within the DMN distinguished depressed from normal elderly subjects. Beyond this double dissociation , low resting FC within the CCN predicted low remission rate and persistence of depressive symptoms and signs, apathy, and dysexecutive behavior after treatment with escitalopram. In contrast, resting FC within the DMN was correlated with pessimism but did not predict treatment response. CONCLUSIONS: If confirmed, these findings may serve as a signature of the brain's functional topography characterizing late-life depression and sustaining its symptoms. By identifying the network abnormalities underlying biologically meaningful characteristics (apathy, dysexecutive behavior, pessimism) and sustaining late-life depression, these findings can provide a novel target on which new somatic and psychosocial treatments can be tested.",2012.0,10.1016/j.jad.2011.12.002,MHB2NPPY,0,cognitive,1317

1318,Development of gender differences in depression: An elaborated cognitive vulnerability-transactional stress theory.,"Hankin, Benjamin L.; Abramson, Lyn Y.","Descriptive epidemiological studies are reviewed, showing that the female preponderance in depression begins to emerge around age 13. A developmentally sensitive, elaborated cognitive vulnerability-transactional stress model of depression is proposed to explain the big fact of the emergence of the gender difference in depression. The elaborated causal chain posits that negative events contribute to initial elevations of general negative affect. Generic cognitive vulnerability factors then moderate the likelihood that the initial negative affect will progress to full-blown depression. Increases in depression can lead transactionally to more self-generated dependent negative life events and thus begin the causal chain again. Evidence is reviewed providing preliminary support for the model as an explanation for the development of the gender difference in depression during adolescence.

1319,The Kleinian expansion of Freud's metapsychology.,"Meltzer, Donald","Traces the implicit and explicit models of the mind used by Freud, M. Klein, and W. R. Bion in clinical work. The central thesis is that Freud's neurophysiological model, Klein's quasi-theological model, and Bion's epistemological model can be superimposed on one another to form a continuous line of development. An apparatus for mental life emerges that embraces meaning and emotion within the framework of a structural concept of the mental apparatus. The case example of a 20-yr-old South American youth escaping from mental hospitals because of his delusions about them illustrates the internal world posited by Klein and not accounted for by Freud's neurophysiological model. Bion's epistemological model is illustrated through interpretation of emotional experiences as represented in dream fragments of a depressed woman in her early forties.

P.; Koenig, W.; Lopez-Sendon, J. L.; Mohler, E. R.; et al.","BACKGROUND: The major determinants and prognostic importance of self-reported health in patients with stable coronary heart disease are uncertain. METHODS AND RESULTS: The STABILITY (Stabilization of Atherosclerotic Plaque by Initiation of Darapladib Therapy) trial randomized 15 828 patients with stable coronary heart disease to treatment with darapladib or placebo. At baseline, 98% of participants completed a questionnaire that included the question, ""Overall, how do you feel your general health is now?"" Possible responses were excellent, very good, good, average, and poor. Adjudicated major adverse cardiac events, which included cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke, were evaluated by Cox regression during 3.7 years of follow-up for participants who reported excellent or very good health (n=2304), good health (n=6863), and average or poor health (n=6361), before and after adjusting for 38 covariates. Self-reported health was most strongly associated with geographic region, depressive symptoms, and low physical activity (P<0.0001 for all). Poor/average compared with very good/excellent self-reported health was independently associated with major adverse cardiac events (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.30 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.92-2.76]; adjusted HR: 1.83 [95% CI, 1.51-2.22]), cardiovascular mortality (HR: 4.36 [95% CI, 3.09-6.16]; adjusted HR: 2.15 [95% CI, 1.45-3.19]), and myocardial infarction (HR: 1.87 [95% CI, 1.46-2.39]; adjusted HR: 1.68 [95% CI, 1.25-2.27]; P<0.0002 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported health is strongly associated with geographical region, mood, and physical activity.

D.; Brand, S.; Mulhall, K. E.; Counter, B.; Millman, J. B.; Fried, J.","A partnership between corporate worksites, a community-based prevention agency, and families in those worksites is described. Its primary goals were the reduction of family risk and enhancement of family protective factors that predispose children and youth to substance abuse and related social and emotional difficulties. A related goal of the program is to reduce family stress levels and attitudes that may influence the parents' levels of risk for substance abuse and related disorder. The program delivery strategy is conceived of as part of the necessary efforts of prevention programs to reach target populations in host settings in which they may naturally participate, thereby reducing obstacles and barriers to participation that often impede prevention efforts. Evaluation revealed that the program was generally better able to retain parents for a fairly lengthy period, and with high rates of attendance. Program attendance was also not affected by parental background characteristics that, in other delivery approaches, are often associated with poor attendance and high drop-out levels. Results also indicated that levels of program exposure (dosage) do make a significant difference in the efficacy of such efforts as those parents in the program who participated in higher percentages and numbers of sessions (i.e. more than 80 \% of sessions) showed both short-term and longer-term (i.e. across 18 month follow-ups) gains in their ratings of the target child's behavior problems and strengths, substance abuse resistance related knowledge and attitudes, reduced parental stress, depression and irritability, and increased utilization of social support. By contrast, parents who received a low program exposure exhibited a more restricted set of short-term gains. The findings are discussed in terms of their importance for consideration of program dosage for prevention programs, and the need to attend to the context in which programming is offered as it may facilitate or impede efforts to provide levels of dosage and fidelity to create enduring impacts.",1994.0,,TTL7VMWW,0,diathesis,1322
1322,Protection from chronic stress- and depressive symptom-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction in female rats is abolished by preexisting metabolic disease,"Brooks, S. D.; Hileman, S. M.; Chantler, P. D.; Milde, S. A.; Lemaster, K. A.; Frisbee, S. J.; Shoemaker, J. K.; Jackson, D. N.; Frisbee, J. C.","While it is known that chronic stress and clinical depression are powerful predictors of poor cardiovascular outcomes, recent clinical evidence has identified correlations between the development of metabolic disease and depressive symptoms, creating a combined condition of severely elevated cardiovascular disease risk. In this study, we used the obese Zucker rat (OZRs) and the unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) model to determine the impact of preexisting metabolic disease on the relationship between chronic stress/depressive symptoms and vascular function. Additionally, we determined the impact of metabolic syndrome on sex-based protection from chronic stress/depressive effects on vascular function in female lean Zucker rats (LZRs). In general, vasodilator reactivity was attenuated under control conditions in OZRs compared with LZRs. Although still impaired, conduit arterial and resistance arteriolar dilator reactivity under control conditions in female OZRs was superior to that in male or ovariectomized (OVX) female OZRs, largely because of better maintenance of vascular nitric oxide and prostacyclin levels. However, imposition of metabolic syndrome in combination with UCMS in OZRs further impaired dilator reactivity in both vessel subtypes to a similarly severe extent and abolished any protective effect in female rats compared with male or OVX female rats. The loss of vascular protection in female OZRs with UCMS was reflected in vasodilator metabolite levels, which closely matched those in male and OVX female OZRs subjected to UCMS. These results suggest that presentation of metabolic disease in combination with depressive symptoms can overwhelm the vasoprotection identified in female rats and, thereby, may reflect a severe impairment to normal endothelial function. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study addresses the protection from chronic stress- and depression-induced vascular dysfunction identified in female compared with male or ovariectomized female rats. We determined the impact of preexisting metabolic disease, a frequent comorbidity of clinical depression in humans, on that vascular protection. With preexisting metabolic syndrome, female rats lost all protection from chronic stress/depressive symptoms and became phenotypically similar to male and ovariectomized female rats, with comparably poor vasoactive dilator metabolite profiles.",2018.0,10.1152/ajpheart.00648.2017,E2AVPAYR,0,additional,1323
1323,Stress-induced changes in the translatome of serotonergic neurons are sex specific,"Neumaier, J.; Lesiak, A.; Coffey, K.; Cohen, J.; Chavkin, C.","Background: Serotonin is a primary mediator of stress, anxiety, and depression and drugs that regulate serotonin reuptake and metabolism have been critical for treating anxiety and depressive disorders. However, currently available medications target rather few mechanisms within these neurons and can induce numerous side effects, highlighting the importance of identifying new molecular targets within the serotonergic neurons. A major challenge in identifying novel molecular targets in serotonergic neurons is the diversity of other cell types that are also located in the midbrain. Methods: In this study, we conducted a cell-specific gene expression analysis of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe utilizing the translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) method. To express HA-tagged RPL22 protein (RiboTag) specifically within serotonergic neurons, we crossed Cre-dependent floxed RiboTag mice with serotonin-specific Cre driver mice (Pet1-CRE). The resulting cross allowed for isolation and next-gen sequencing of ribosome-associated mRNA transcripts specifically from serotonergic neurons. RNA was collected from mice 4 hours after the last swim of a two-day repeated swim stress and were compared to that of unstressed mice. RiboTagassociated RNA was used to make RNA libraries that were than subjected to RNAseq and downstream bioinformatics analysis. Normalized gene counts were analyzed by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and differentially expressed genes were identified with DESeq2. Results: RNA was collected from mice 4 hours after the last swim of a two-day repeated swim stress and were compared to that of unstressed mice. RiboTag-associated RNA was used to make RNA libraries that were than subjected to RNAseq and downstream bioinformatics analysis. Normalized gene counts were analyzed by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and differentially expressed genes were identified with DESeq2. The differentially expressed genes were analyzed for upstream and downstream motifs and for coregulation using unbiased cluster analyses. There were substantially more differentially expressed RNAs identified in stressed female mice relative to unstressed than in males. Several patterns emerged in the females, including evidence for co-regulation of neuroinflammatory pathways as well coordinated regulation of membrane channels within serotonin neurons of female mice. Validation of differentially expressed genes are currently being validated in new sets of mice. Conclusions: These data point to a number of novel targets within serotonin neurons that may be important new targets for the development of antidepressant treatments.",2017.0,10.1038/npp.2017.265,KW7T9FWW,0,additional,1324
1324,Metacognitive therapy in recurrent depression: a case replication series in Denmark.,"Callesen, Pia; Jensen, Anne Backhausen; Wells, Adrian","Metacognitive therapy (MCT) for depression is derived from the Wells and Matthews (1994) self-regulatory model, in which a Cognitive-Attentional Syndrome (CAS) is the cause of psychological disorders. MCT for depression focuses on identifying patients' CAS and helps them to stop it. The CAS consists of worry, rumination and dysfunctional coping strategies. The focus in MCT is on removing the CAS by challenging positive and negative metacognitive beliefs and eliminating dysfunctional behaviors. In this case series, MCT was delivered to four depressed Danes and treatment was evaluated in 5-11 sessions of up to one hour each. An A-B design with follow-up at 3 and 6 months was conducted and the primary outcome was Beck's Depression Inventory II (BDI-II). We measured CAS processes with the Major depressive Disorder Scale (MDD-S). The results of the case series showed clinically significant improvements in depressive symptoms, rumination and metacognitive beliefs and the effects were still present at follow-up for all patients. The small number of patients and decreasing baselines observed in some cases limits the conclusions. However, the results suggest that this treatment is feasible and was associated with large improvements in symptoms when delivered away from its point of origin and in a Danish help-seeking sample.",2014.0,10.1111/sjop.12089,SEG9BVNK,0,cognitive,1325

A.","Purpose: Older adults with a visual impairment are particularly vulnerable for increased depression and anxiety symptoms; however, they tend to underutilise mental health services. The present study aims to characterise the perceived need for and barriers to use mental health services in visually impaired older adults based on Andersen's behavioural model. Methods: A cross-sectional study in 871 visually impaired older adults (mean age 73 years) from outpatient low vision rehabilitation services was conducted. A multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed to assess potential-related factors to perceived need for mental health services, measured with the Perceived Need for Care Questionnaire (PNCQ). Results: About 35 \% of the population had subthreshold depression and/or anxiety, and 13 \% had a mood and/or anxiety disorder according to the DSM-IV. Almost 34 \% of the participants with an actual disorder did not receive mental health services, even though 57 \% perceived to be in need of these services. Participants who had more severe depression and/or anxiety, comorbid depression and anxiety, no history of major depressive disorder, a lower perceived health status and a younger age were more likely to be in need of mental health services. Barriers to receive these services were lack of knowledge and self-reliance. Conclusions: Findings support the implementation of counselling methods, instead of medication, and patient empowerment to reduce an unmet need of mental health services in visually impaired older adults, for which extensive research is warranted.",2015.0,,7IVDZJIJ,0,behavior,1327

E.; Boydell, K.; Derzko, C.; Marshall, V.","OBJECTIVE: This study measures psychologic distress in women attending a menopause clinic to determine if significant differences exist between peri-menopausal and menopausal women. METHOD: Consecutive women attending a university hospital menopause clinic were administered the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and a study questionnaire to determine menopausal symptoms, menstrual cycle status, and use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The BSI results were compared between menopausal and perimenopausal women, and to a normative sample of middle-aged women who were nonpatients. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-nine menopause clinic women completed the questionnaire: 113 perimenopausal and 146 menopausal women. There was significantly greater psychologic distress on the BSI among perimenopausal as compared to menopausal women on the global severity index, and each of the anxiety, hostility, somatization, depression, paranoid, and psychoticism subscales. Perimenopausal women met BSI caseness severity criteria significantly more often than did menopausal women on the global severity index, and on the subscales for depression, anxiety, and psychoticism. On the BSI, menopausal women showed results similar to those of a normative sample of nonpatient middle-aged women. CONCLUSIONS: Perimenopausal women attending menopause clinics have significantly higher levels of psychologic distress meeting case severity criteria on the BSI.

We examined the association of psychological factors to baseline pain perception and pentazocine analgesia among 49 healthy women and 39 men. Subjects completed psychological questionnaires measuring positive and negative affect as well as catastrophizing. Subsequently, responses to experimental pain were assessed before and after double-blind administration of intravenous pentazocine (0.5mg/kg). In correlational analyses, positive affect predicted lower pain sensitivity among men but not women. Negative affect predicted lower baseline pain tolerances among both sexes but predicted poorer analgesia only among men. Catastrophizing was associated with greater pain sensitivity and less analgesia more consistently in men than women. Regression models revealed that positive affect predicted lower overall pain sensitivity and catastrophizing predicted poorer overall analgesic responses among men, while no significant predictors of overall pain or analgesia emerged for women. Moreover, positive affect and catastrophizing were negatively and positively correlated, respectively, with side effects from the medication, but only among men.

We examine the prevalence of DD and depressive symptoms and determine baseline demographic, social, psychological, and physical health correlates. Methods A convenience sample of 70 cancer patients in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, was screened for DD using an abbreviated version of the Structured Clinical Interview for Depression (SCID) and for depressive symptoms using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Demographic, psychosocial, psychiatric, and physical health characteristics were also assessed, along with past treatments for colon cancer. Bivariate and multivariate analyses identified predictors of DD and symptoms. Results The 1-month prevalence of DD was 30.0 \% (12.9 \% major depression, 5.7 \% minor depression, and 11.4 \% for dysthymia) and significant depressive symptoms were present in 57.1 \% (HDRS 8 or higher), including having persistent suicidal thoughts for 2 weeks or longer wthin the past month (14.3 \% ). Low social support and having a co-morbid psychiatric illness (particularly anxiety) independently predicted DD based on the SCID. Saudi nationality, poor financial situation, low social support, and co-morbid psychiatric illness independently predicted depressive symptoms on the HDRS. Surprisingly, stage of cancer, duration of cancer, and treatments for cancer were unrelated to DD or depressive symptoms. Conclusions DD and significant depressive symptoms are common in patients with colon cancer in Saudi Arabia, and are predicted by a distinct set of demographic and psychosocial risk factors that may help with identification.

Theories are evaluated on the basis of (a) the adequacy of their explanation of predisposing and precipitating variables in depression, and (b) their comprehensiveness in dealing with various manifestations of depression, particularly the cognitive, affective, and self-punitive aspects. While some behavioral theories do incorporate cognitive variables, this dimension of depression represents the greatest weakness of these theories. Self-regulation, a relatively recent extension of behavioral concepts, provides a model of behavior that includes cognitive components. A model of depression is presented that views depression in terms of a self-regulation dysfunction.

1335,Black sun: Depression and melancholia.,"Kristeva, Julia; Roudiez, Leon S.","In this third in a series of volumes in which she analyzes basic manifestations of the psyche, Julia Kristeva addresses melancholia, that glaring and inescapable abyss of sorrow and its incommunicable grief. She shows how the depressive is one of the very few among us who perceives the sense of self at its very root as a dilemma-becoming both a crucial pursuit and a nearly unattainable goal. More clearly than the rest of us, she maintains, depressives see the immensity of this dichotomy but can do nothing more than slump and remain powerless during their exceptional moment of insight. Kristeva describes the curative power of psychoanalysis as essential, although she argues against some aspects of Freudian theory and agrees that drugs may play an important role as anti-depressants. She explains how the love of a lost identity or attachment lies at the very core of depression's dark heart, a loss cuddled by apathy, listlessness, and a dense dark void that sweetly seduces its prospective tenant. According to Kristeva, a woman feels loss in a way intrinsically different from a man because of the more formidable task of gaining autonomy from her mother-without the loss of her mother's love. Kristeva turns to art and literature, drawing on philosophy, the history of religion and culture, as well as psychoanalysis, to analyze Holbein's controversial 1522 painting The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb. Kristeva has revealing comments on this enigmatic painting, and on the works of Marguerite Duras, Dostoyevsky and Nerval. Black Sun takes the view that depression is a discourse with a language to be learned, rather than strictly a pathology to be physically treated. Kristeva draws parallels between the malaise of contemporary Western civilization and its pervasive loss of values-a black sun that threatens to eclipse our larger social self.

Abstraction, complexity of language use, and negative affective language were evaluated. The 523 participants were randomly distributed to each of the four experimental conditions: news frame (crime versus economic contribution) by group cue (geographical origin of the immigrants involved: Moroccans versus Latin Americans). Through content analysis of the ideas and reflections that arose after the participants read the different news stories, using the Linguistic Category Model (LCM; Semin \& Fiedler, 1991) to measure abstract language and the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC; Pennebaker, Booth, \& Francis, 2007) to analyze complex language and negative affective language, it emerged that abstract language and negative affective language were more frequent in the participants assigned to the news frame on crime. Complex language was more commonly used when the news frame referred to the economic contribution of immigrants. Regression analyses showed the mediating role of attitude to immigration in the effects of news frame on negative affective language. The bootstrap method was used to assess the magnitude of the indirect effect. A significant mediator effect was also found through structural equation modeling. Analyses of covariance showed one interaction between news frame and group cue: Among those who read the news story in a frame linking immigration to crime and Moroccan origin, abstract language was more characteristic.

Such barriers can be surmounted by approaches based on principles of good medical management, including: use of a multidisciplinary treatment team; education of patients and their families regarding the nature of depression and its treatments; the formation of an alliance among clinicians, patients, and family members; and the establishing of a clinic atmosphere that fosters such an alliance. Strategies to promote adherence should also address issues in practitioner disposition and training and barriers that arise as a result of the direct effects of depressive illness on the patient.

1339,[IDEM-depression: Characteristics and evaluation of an open group that combines psychoeducation and cognitive-behavior therapy],"Weiner, L.; Garcia-Krafes, E.; Garcia, S.; Berthomier, C.; Morali, A.; Metzger, J. Y.; Weibel, S.; Javelot, H.; Bertschy, G.","INTRODUCTION: Depression is a highly prevalent mental illness that is associated with high rates of morbidity and functional impairment. At the psychiatric unit of the University Hospital of Strasbourg, France, we have developed an open group that combines psychoeducation and cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT), the information, discovery, exchange and mobilization for depression group (IDEM-depression). IDEM-depression is composed of 17 thematic, structured, and independent sessions, which address different aspects of depression (i.e., rumination, pharmacological treatments). Because of its flexible format, patients with varying degrees of depression severity (from remission up to severe depressive symptoms) and whose depression might be bipolar or unipolar, are able to participate in the group. Thus, the group is well suited to a large number of patients with major depression. In the present study we aimed at describing the IDEM-depression group and presenting results regarding patients' overall satisfaction, assessed via two self-report questionnaires (the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire, the CSQ-8, and the IDEM ad hoc questionnaire), as well as its effect on mood following each session assessed via a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 up to 100. METHOD: Sixty-five patients participated in 50 sessions of the IDEM-depression group in two hospitals in Alsace. 61% of the patients had bipolar disorder, and 41% of them were inpatients. Sessions took place on a weekly basis, lasted 2hours and were proposed by a CBT-trained clinical psychologist. Patients were asked to fill-out the VAS at the beginning and at the end of each session. Moreover, they were asked to fill-out the CSQ-8 and the IDEM ad hoc questionnaire when they left the group. Other than one session (""yoga and mindfulness""), all the sessions (16 out of 17) were structured on a Powerpoint((c)) presentation. During the first hour information was given regarding the topic (i.e., rumination), and a shared CBT conceptualization of the topic was formulated by the participants and the psychologist. For most sessions, the first hour was therefore communication and information-based, whereas during the second hour participants were asked to participate in in-session behavioral experiments and/or to evaluate specific aspects of their behavior (thoughts, emotions, activity, mindful behavior) during the last few days. The therapist manual and the slides for each session are available via e-mail to the first author. RESULTS: Regarding the results, self-reported mood on the VAS was compared between the onset (225 VAS) and the end (225 VAS) of each session. Overall, results suggest that self-reported mood is significantly improved following the participation in sessions (t=-5. 87, P<0.001). Moreover, mean results on the CSQ-8 suggest that patients are highly satisfied with the group (M=24.46, SD=6.42). Among them, 82% reported a moderate-high satisfaction with the group. On the IDEM ad hoc questionnaire, patients reported an overall high satisfaction level regarding (i) the content of sessions, (ii) the duration of sessions, (iii) the frequency of sessions, (iv) how much they felt they could express themselves during sessions. In the qualitative comments of this questionnaire, patients reported that the group helped them to gain an understanding of the mechanisms involved in depression; to feel less isolated and guilty; and to learn about specific psychotherapeutic tools (i.e., mindfulness) and to try to implement them. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that an IDEM-depression group is well suited to a wide-array of clinical pictures associated with depression (varying severity, bipolar or unipolar, inpatients and outpatients). This is probably due to its open-group format which is particularly well-adapted to the dynamic symptomatology associated with major depression, and may stimulate decentering in patients who have different levels of severity of symptoms but participate in the same session. Moreover, its impact on mood improvement, and the high satisfaction leve reported by patients, seem to be related to its CBT and psychoeducation-based content on the one hand, which has shown its efficacy in depression. On the other hand, IDEM's structured open-group format might have also contributed to the improvement in mood and the overall good satisfaction reported by patients, through the social support provided by the group, improved feeling of self-efficiency, and its effect on stigmatization. Thus, IDEM-depression group is an efficacious, flexible, low-cost, and easy to implement (in different clinical settings) psychotherapeutic option for major depression.",2018.0,10.1016/j.encep.2016.09.004,HXZQMHC2,0,additional,1340

1341,Depression severity and cognitive symptoms are independent predictors of functioning in patients with depression,"Larsen, K. G.; Haro, J. M.; Saragoussi, D.; Hammer-Helmich, L.","Introduction: Functional impairment is a significant burden in major depressive disorder (MDD) and can persist after remission of mood symptoms, preventing a full return to social and prof essional life. Recent real-world evidence shows that cognitive dysfunction is an important mediator of functional impairment in MDD. However, there is a debate whether this is or is not independent of depressive symptoms. PERFORM (Prospective Epidemiological Research on Functioning Outcomes Related to Major depressive disorder) is a European 2-year prospective observational cohort study which included 1457 patients treated for MDD. This analysis aims to investigate the impact of patient rated depression severity and cognitive symptoms on functioning in patients treated for MDD. Methodology: Structural Equations Models were used to jointly model the trajectories of patient-rated depression severity measured by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), patient-rated cognitive symptoms measured by Perceived Deficits Questionnaire-5 (PDQ-5) and patient rated functional impairment measured by Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). It was assumed that ratings made at the same time point were correlated, and that any rating could depend on ratings from an earlier but not a later time point. Statistical tests were used for general goodness-of-fit and for testing of specific regression coefficients. Standardized regression coefficients (SRC) were used to evaluate the interaction between PHQ-9, PDQ-5 and SDS over time. Results: Both patient rated depression severity (PHQ-9), cognitive symptoms (PDQ-5) and functional impairment (SDS) depended moderately to strongly on the previous value of the assessment of the same scale (depression: 0.38-0.71; cognition: 0.60-0.71; functioning: 0.44-0.50; all p < 0.001). Furthermore, depression severity, cognitive symptoms and functional impair ment were all correlated at all time points (all p < 0.001). Taking these correlations into account, and with a significance level of 0.001, depression severity at Month 2, 6 and 12 predicted functional impairment at Month 6, 12 and 18 (SRC: 0.17, 0.25 and 0.25, respectively); cognitive symptoms at Baseline and Month 18 predicted depression severity at Month 2 and 24 (SRC: 0.19 and 0.22, respectively); and cognitive symptoms at Baseline, Month 2 and 18 predicted functional impairment at Month 2, 6 and 24 (SRC: 0.18, 0.15 and 0.22, respectively). Functional impairment did not significantly predict depression severity or cognitive symptoms at any time points at the 0.001 significance level. Neither did depression severity predict cognitive symptoms at any of the time points at the 0.001 level. Conclusion/discussion: Beyond confirming that patient-reported depression severity is a major predictor of functional impairment, this analysis shows that patient-reported cognitive symptoms also are independent and important predictors of later functional impairment. These findings highlight the importance of recognizing cognitive symptoms in patients with MDD in daily practice and suggest that treatment interventions targeting depression and cognitive symptoms could improve functional recovery in this population.",2017.0,,YRXVJEEQ,0,additional,1342

We hypothesized that individuals with low plasma GABA levels may be more prone to develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the aftermath of trauma exposure. Methods: To test this hypothesis, we measured plasma GABA levels in a population of 108 road traffic accident victims on arrival at a traumatology department and assessed them for PTSD 6 weeks later. Results: The mean GABA level (nmol/mL) in the PTSD group (n = 55; M = .20; SD = .08) was significantly lower compared with members of the trauma-exposed group who did not develop PTSD [n = 17; M = .30; SD = .09), t(70) = 3.94, p = .0002]. Conclusions: Provided that GABA levels in the brain are genetically predetermined, our results would suggest that individuals with low plasma GABA levels are premorbidly more vulnerable to stress-related disorders such as acute PTSD. If replicated, plasma GABA levels measured in the aftermath of trauma exposure might help to identify individuals at high risk for developing PTSD.",2004.0,10.1016/j.biopsych.2003.08.009,XMS9MDGC,0,diathesis,1343

1344,"To be sure, to be sure: intolerance of uncertainty mediates symptoms of various anxiety disorders and depression.","McEvoy, Peter M.; Mahoney, Alison E. J.","The Intolerance of Uncertainty Model was initially developed as an explanation for worry within the context of generalized anxiety disorder. However, recent research has identified intolerance of uncertainty (IU) as a possible transdiagnostic maintaining factor across the anxiety disorders and depression. The aim of this study was to determine whether IU mediated the relationship between neuroticism and symptoms related to various anxiety disorders and depression in a treatment-seeking sample (N=328). Consistent with previous research, IU was significantly associated with neuroticism as well as with symptoms of social phobia, panic disorder and agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and depression. Moreover, IU explained unique variance in these symptom measures when controlling for neuroticism. Mediational analyses showed that IU was a significant partial mediator between neuroticism and all symptom measures, even when controlling for symptoms of other disorders. More specifically, anxiety in anticipation of future uncertainty (prospective anxiety) partially mediated the relationship between neuroticism and symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (i.e. worry) and obsessive-compulsive disorder, whereas inaction in the face of uncertainty (inhibitory anxiety) partially mediated the relationship between neuroticism and symptoms of social anxiety, panic disorder and agoraphobia, and depression. Sobel's test demonstrated that all hypothesized meditational pathways were associated with significant indirect effects, although the mediation effect was stronger for worry than other symptoms. Potential implications of these findings for the treatment of anxiety disorders and depression are discussed.",2012.0,10.1016/j.beth.2011.02.007,X8N348H7,0,cognitive_additional,1345

A combination of genetic and environmental risk factors probably contributes to MD. We present data from a genome-wide association study revealing a neuron-specific neutral amino acid transporter (SLC6A15) as a susceptibility gene for MD. Risk allele carrier status in humans and chronic stress in mice were associated with a downregulation of the expression of this gene in the hippocampus, a brain region implicated in the pathophysiology of MD. The same polymorphisms also showed associations with alterations in hippocampal volume and neuronal integrity. Thus, decreased SLC6A15 expression, due to genetic or environmental factors, might alter neuronal circuits related to the susceptibility for MD. Our convergent data from human genetics, expression studies, brain imaging, and animal models suggest a pathophysiological mechanism for MD that may be accessible to drug targeting. \textcopyright 2011 Elsevier Inc.",2011.0,10.1016/j.neuron.2011.04.005,MX953GWH,0,diathesis,1346

Pattern specificity and consistency with the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory.,"Kales, Anthony; Caldwell, Alex B.; Soldatos, Constantin R.; Bixler, Edward O.; Kales, Joyce D.","Assessed the specificity of personality factors in Ss with chronic insomnia. The MMPI was administered to 428 insomniacs (aged 19-74 yrs) and 100 controls. Comparison of the MMPI profiles of insomniacs from a semirural area and of those from an urban area, each in a different geographic region, showed results consistent for high levels of psychopathology as well as for specific personality patterns within and between groups. The personality patterns of insomniacs were remarkably homogeneous: Only a few MMPI code types accounted for about half of each insomniac sample. The insomniac profiles were consistently characterized by the presence of neurotic depression, rumination, chronic anxiety, inhibition of emotions, and inability to discharge anger outwardly. Results confirm the hypothesis that the handling of stresses and conflicts through an internalization of emotions leads to physiologic activation and is a major factor underlying the development and maintenance of chronic insomnia. Therapeutic intervention should focus on eliciting emotional discharge during the day and minimizing arousal at night.

L.; Bowen, A.","While there are reports of the impact of specific interventions designed to reduce HIV drug and sexual risk behaviors, there are few reports of the impact of HIV interventions in a community-based sample. We report on baseline data from a sample of African American crack smokers who were about to participate in an intervention designed to reduce HIV-related risk behaviors. The majority were male (80 \% ), single (70 \% ) and homeless (52 \% ). Data indicated that 29 \% of the sample had been in a previous HIV intervention in the past 12 months, the majority in a correctional setting or CBO program. There were few systematic demographic differences between the two groups. Those who had been in an intervention reported using male and female condoms significantly more frequently on all measures of condom use, had positive condom use outcome expectations for male condoms and higher affective and situational condom-related self-efficacy beliefs. These data suggest that, at a community level, the spectrum of HIV risk-reduction programs does produce a significant improvement in condom use and related cognitions, although there is a need to cover a greater proportion of the population. Previous exposure to interventions must be a critical covariate in assessing the impact of future interventions. \textcopyright 2007 Taylor \& Francis.",2007.0,,VA3FMHWU,0,behavior,1348

Covert modeling entails the modeling paradigm without live or film models. A model who executed behaviors which would be anxiety-provoking for the S was imagined by the S. Different model descriptions were used: a coping model who was depicted as initially anxious but eventually fearless in fear-relevant scenes, and a mastery model who was depicted as performing fearlessly throughout the scenes. A scene control group received similar scenes as modeling groups without the presence of the model. A delayed-treatment control group was used to assess the effects of repeated testing at pretreatment and posttreatment assessment, and received no intervening treatment. Subsequently, this group received covert modeling without specification of affective cues of the model. In 2 sessions, all covert modeling groups showed significant increases in approach behavior and reductions in emotional arousal and anxiety ratings. Changes in attitudes were less consistent across treatments. No-treatment and scene control groups did not improve on any of the measures. As predicted from previous work on attributes of the model, a coping model led to greater change at posttest than the mastery model. The effect of both treatment conditions was maintained at a 3-wk follow-up assessment. (24 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",,,J25IMH6X,0,cognitive,1350

F.; Nolen, Willem A.; Speckens, Anne E. M.","Background: Previous studies have suggested that patients' treatment preferences may influence treatment outcome. The current study investigated whether preference for either mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) or maintenance antidepressant medication (mADM) to prevent relapse in recurrent depression was associated with patients' characteristics, treatment adherence, or treatment outcome of MBCT. Methods: The data originated from two parallel randomised controlled trials, the first comparing the combination of MBCT and mADM to MBCT in patients preferring MBCT (n = 249), the second comparing the combination to mADM alone in patients preferring mADM (n = 68). Patients' characteristics were compared across the trials (n = 317). Subsequently, adherence and clinical outcomes were compared for patients who all received the combination (n = 154). Results: Patients with a preference for mADM reported more previous depressive episodes and higher levels of mindfulness at baseline. Preference did not affect adherence to either MBCT or mADM. With regard to treatment outcome of MBCT added to mADM, preference was not associated with relapse/recurrence (chi2 = 0.07; p = .80), severity of (residual) depressive symptoms during the 15-month follow-up period (beta = -0.08, p = .49), or quality of life. Limitations: The group preferring mADM was relatively small. The influence of preferences on outcome may have been limited in the current study because both preference groups received both interventions. Conclusions: The fact that patients with a preference for medication did equally well as those with a preference for mindfulness supports the applicability of MBCT for recurrent depression. Future studies of MBCT should include measures of preferences to increase knowledge in this area.

The current author states that Richard Gottlieb is to be congratulated for his attempt to understand the efficacy of SSRI medication in psychoanalytic terms. The editors of JAPA are similarly to be recognized for their willingness to further the dialogue between psychoanalysis and psychopharmacology. He proposes that SSRIs are effective for the treatment of depression and some other conditions because, by whatever neurochemical mechanism, they attenuate or remove aggression. His evidence consists of the common clinical observation that when depression, obsessive-compulsive neurosis, or some cases of social anxiety are treated with SSRIs, the aggression disappears as the patient recovers. The various categories of medication include the primarily dopamine agents such as pramipexole and ropinerole; the MAOs, tricyclics, and mirtazapine, all of which increase the availability of many neurotransmitters, including dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin; and the serotonin drugs to which the author refers.

J.; Cloostermans, T.; Demyttenaere, K.; Dom, R.; Fryns, J. P. and","For people at risk for Huntington's disease, the anxiety and uncertainty about the future may be very burdensome and may be an obstacle to personal decision making about important life issues, for example, procreation. For some at risk persons, this situation is the reason for requesting predictive DNA testing. The aim of this paper is two-fold. First, we want to evaluate whether knowing one's carrier status reduces anxiety and uncertainty and whether it facilitates decision making about procreation. Second, we endeavour to identify pretest predictors of psychological adaptation one year after the predictive test (psychometric evaluation of general anxiety, depression level, and ego strength). The impact of the predictive test result was assessed in 53 subjects tested, using pre- and post-test psychometric measurement and self-report data of follow up interviews. Mean anxiety and depression levels were significantly decreased one year after a good test result; there was no significant change in the case of a bad test result. The mean personality profile, including ego strength, remained unchanged one year after the test. The study further shows that the test result had a definite impact on reproductive decision making. Stepwise multiple regression analyses were used to select the best predictors of the subject's post-test reactions. The results indicate that a careful evaluation of pretest ego strength, depression level, and coping strategies may be helpful in predicting post-test reactions, independently of the carrier status. Test result (carrier/ non-carrier), gender, and age did not significantly contribute to the prediction. About one third of the variance of post-test anxiety and depression level and more than half of the variance of ego strength was explained, implying that other psychological or social aspects should also be taken into account when predicting individual post-test reactions.",1996.0,,R23FI828,0,personality,1359

There remains a need to better characterize psychosocial risk factors of cognitive decline in older adults with depression. We hypothesized that certain psychosocial factors would be associated with higher risk of cognitive decline in individuals with late-life depression. METHODS: 130 individuals aged \textgreater /= 65 years who had achieved remission from a major depressive episode were randomized to donepezil or placebo and then closely followed for two years. Using Cox proportional hazard models, we examined the association between baseline median household income, education level, race, marital status, and social support and cognitive decline over the follow-up. RESULTS: Lower interpersonal support (OR = 0.86 [0.74-0.99], p = .04) and lower baseline global neuropsychological score (OR = 0.56 [0.36-0.87], p = .001) predicted shorter time to conversion to MCI or dementia in univariate models. These exposures did not remain significant in multivariate analyses. Neither socioeconomic status nor other psychosocial factors independently predicted cognitive diagnostic conversion (p \textgreater .05). CONCLUSIONS: We did not find reliable associations between cognitive outcome and any of the psychosocial factors examined. Future large-scale, epidemiological studies, ideally using well-validated subjective measures, should better characterize psychosocial risk factors for cognitive decline in late-life depression.",2015.0,10.5770/cgj.18.134,TCEBCWB2,0,cognitive,1360

1361,Life events and personality characteristics in depression,"Perris, H.","Evidence from many sources supports the view that stressful life events might be relevant for the onset and development of depression, but their pathogenic role is still only poorly understood. One approach in trying to elucidate the role of life events in depression, might be to study them from a multi-factorial point of view, taking into account the vulnerability of the individual experiencing them. As part of such an investigation, 138 depressed patients with a mean age of 45 years have participated in a study of life events and personality traits. In particular, it was tested whether aspects of aggression might interact with the occurrence and perception of external stressful events. Patients who scored high on outward aggression had experienced more stressful events, and patients who scored high on inhibition of aggression had experienced fewer, but more negatively. It is concluded that a combined study of the occurrence of life events and the personality characteristics of the patients experiencing them might enhance our understanding of the pathogenic role of life events in depression.",1984.0,,R624DWMK,0,personality,1362

E.","Despite recent findings that the prevalence of unipolar depression is as high in adolescents as it is in adults, relatively little is known about the applicability of cognitive theories of depression to adolescents. The present study examined the nature, specificity, and stability of cognitive dysfunction in male and female depressed, remitted, and psychiatric control adolescents. Factor analysis of a diverse set of measures yielded two factors, labelled Negative Cognitions and Attributional Style. Scores on both these factors were related to a current diagnosis of depression. Results also indicated that there may not be complete recovery of cognitive functioning (or of depressed mood) with diagnostic remission of depression. Finally, whereas elevated scores on the Negative Cognitions factor appeared to be specific to depression, the depressed and psychiatric control adolescents did not differ with respect to their scores on the Attributional Style factor.",1993.0,,EW6FZK7W,0,cognitive,1363

The authors conducted a randomized trial of a communication coaching intervention in which 22 female breast cancer survivors were randomized to the coaching and 22 to treatment as usual. They hypothesized that the intervention would increase breast cancer self-efficacy, improve mood, and reduce fears of recurrence. Through a series of ANCOVAs they found that the intervention led to increases in self-efficacy. Changes in self-efficacy predicted changes in anxiety, depression, and womanhood fears. This coaching intervention shows promise but requires additional studies to establish is efficacy and effectiveness.",2010.0,10.1080/07347332.2010.516811,K2STQ5EG,0,behavior,1364

The purpose of the present investigation was to conduct post hoc analyses on sex and ethnic minority subgroups to assess whether any treatment subgroup is at reduced or increased risk of greater morbidity/mortality. METHODS: The 2481 patients with MI (973 white men, 424 minority men, 674 white women, 410 minority women) who had major or minor depression and/or low perceived social support were randomly allocated to usual medical care or cognitive behavior therapy. Total mortality or recurrent nonfatal MI (ENRICHD primary endpoint) and cardiac mortality or recurrent nonfatal MI (secondary endpoint) were analyzed as composite endpoints by group for time to first event using Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: There was a trend in the direction of treatment efficacy for white men for the primary endpoint (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95 \% confidence interval, 0.61-1.05; p =.10) and a significant (p \textless .006, Bonferroni corrected) effect for the secondary endpoint (HR, 0.63; 95 \% CI, 0.46-0.87; p =.004). In contrast, the HRs for each of the other three subgroups were nonsignificant. The magnitude of differences in treatment effects between white men and the other subgroups remained significant for the secondary endpoint (p =.04) after adjustment for age, education, living alone, antidepressant use, comorbidity score, cardiac catheterization, ejection fraction, history of hypertension, and major depression. CONCLUSIONS: White men, but not other subgroups, may have benefited from the ENRICHD intervention, suggesting that future studies need to attend to issues of treatment design and delivery that may have prevented benefit among sex and ethnic subgroups other than white men.",2004.0,10.1097/01.psy.0000133217.96180.e8,UG3HCLQ3,0,cognitive,1366

I.; Klopper, M.; van der Merwe, L.; Aitken, L.; de Wit, E.; Black, G. F.; Hoal, E. G.; Walzl, G.; Seedat, S.","Background: We evaluated the role that selected variants in serotonin transporter (5-HTT), dopamine receptor 2 (DRD2) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) genes play in PTSD symptom severity in an at-risk population. We also investigated the interaction between the genetic variants to determine whether these variables and the interactions between the variables influenced the severity of PTSD symptoms. Methods: PTSD symptoms were quantitatively assessed using the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) in 150 participants from an at-risk South African population. All participants were genotyped for the 5-HTTLPR, DRD2 Taq1A and BDNF Val66Met polymorphisms. Gene-gene interactions were investigated using various linear models. All analyses were adjusted for age, gender, major depressive disorder diagnosis, level of resilience, level of social support and alcohol dependence. Results: A significant interaction effect between DRD2 Taq1A and BDNF Val66Met variants on DTS score was observed. On the background of the BDNF Val66Val genotype, DTS score increased significantly with the addition of a DRD2 Taq1A A1 allele. However, on the BDNF Met66 allele background, the addition of an A1 allele was found to reduce total DTS score. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence for an epistatic interaction between BDNF Val66Met and DRD2 Taq1A polymorphisms on the severity of PTSD symptoms, where both too little and too much dopamine can result in increased PTSD symptom severity. \textcopyright 2012 Elsevier Inc.",2013.0,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2012.10.011,5XKT3A4X,0,diathesis,1367

1368,The relationship between internal object representations and affective style: A TAT study.,"Kerner, Robin B.","This study explored the relationship between internalized object representations and interpersonal affective style (AS). Subjects were drawn from a sample of families participating in the Yale Psychiatric Institute Family Study (Diamond \& Doane, 1994). The present study examined only the parents in these families (N = 70). At the time of their child's psychiatric admission, these subjects were administered the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) and participated in a family interaction task in order to assess their affective style (AS; Doane et al., 1981). TATs were scored utilizing Westen's (1985, revised 1989) Social Cognition and Object Relations Scale (SCORS). It was hypothesized that subjects who have internalized poor object relations would manifest a negative affective style in their interactional behaviors. It was also posited that treatment outcome for patients in families with lower levels of object relations would be worse than those from families with higher object relations. None of the planned tests for the hypotheses yielded significant results. Post-hoc analyses of the data, which separated the subjects by child's diagnostic classification, did find significant relationships. Higher overall level of object relations was associated with less negative affective style, and there were significant correlations between a number of object relations and AS subscales. However, in the nonschizophrenia group, significance was found only at baseline, whereas in the schizophrenia group, significance emerged only when analyzing the 3-month data. These results are discussed in terms of underlying family dynamics. The counterintuitive findings of this study speak to the complexity one's internal world, and, perhaps, to the inability of a single measure to fully capture the nature of one's object representations. This study raises important questions as to the impact of environmental factors on object relations functioning, the stability of internalized object representations, as well as to the association of AS and object relations dimensions to specific psychopathology. Areas of future exploration suggested by the results include the use of the TAT in object relations assessment, the validity of the SCORS, and the relationship between attachment, object relations, psychopathology, and the expression of negative affect.

This study used qualitative methods to assess perceived predisposing and protective factors for perinatal depression in lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer (LGBQ) women. Two focus groups with LGBQ women were conducted: 1) biological parents of young children and 2) nonbiological parents of young children or whose partners were currently pregnant. Three major themes emerged. Issues related to social support were primary, particularly related to disappointment with the lack of support provided by members of the family of origin. Participants also described issues related to the couple relationship, such as challenges in negotiating parenting roles. Finally, legal and policy barriers (e.g., second parent adoption) were identified as a significant source of stress during the transition to parenthood. Both lack of social support and relationship problems have previously been identified as risk factors for perinatal depression in heterosexual women, and legal and policy barriers may represent a unique risk factor for this population. Therefore, additional study of perinatal mental health among LGBQ women is warranted. \textcopyright 2005 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.",2005.0,10.1016/j.jmwh.2005.08.002,KPRKJS5Y,0,diathesis,1371

J.; Noble, A. J.; Morgan, M.; Taylor, S. J. C.; McCrone, P.; et al.","Background: Epilepsy is a common neurological condition resulting in recurrent seizures. Research evidence in long‐term conditions suggests that patients benefit from self‐management education and that this may improve quality of life (QoL). Epilepsy self‐management education has yet to be tested in a UK setting. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of Self‐Management education for people with poorly controlled epILEpsy [SMILE (UK)]. Design: A parallel pragmatic randomised controlled trial. Setting: Participants were recruited from eight hospitals in London and south‐east England. Participants: Adults aged >= 16 years with epilepsy and two or more epileptic seizures in the past year, who were currently being prescribed antiepileptic drugs. Intervention: A 2‐day group self‐management course alongside treatment as usual (TAU). The control group received TAU. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome is QoL in people with epilepsy at 12‐month follow‐up using the Quality Of Life In Epilepsy 31‐P (QOLIE‐31‐P) scale. Other outcomes were seizure control, impact of epilepsy, medication adverse effects, psychological distress, perceived stigma, self‐mastery and medication adherence. Cost‐effectiveness analyses and a process evaluation were undertaken. Randomisation: A 1: 1 ratio between trial arms using fixed block sizes of two. Blinding: Participants were not blinded to their group allocation because of the nature of the study. Researchers involved in data collection and analysis remained blinded throughout. Results: The trial completed successfully. A total of 404 participants were enrolled in the study [SMILE (UK), n = 205; TAU, n = 199] with 331 completing the final follow‐up at 12 months [SMILE (UK), n = 163; TAU, n = 168]. In the intervention group, 61.5% completed all sessions of the course. No adverse events were found to be related to the intervention. At baseline, participants had a mean age of 41.7 years [standard deviation (SD) 14.1 years], and had epilepsy for a median of 18 years. The mean QOLIE‐31‐P score for the whole group at baseline was 66.0 out of 100.0 (SD 14.2). Clinically relevant levels of anxiety symptoms were reported in 53.6% of the group and depression symptoms in 28.0%. The results following an intention‐to‐treat analysis showed no change in any measures at the 12‐month follow‐up [QOLIE‐31‐P: SMILE (UK) mean: 67.4, SD 13.5; TAU mean: 69.5, SD 14.8]. The cost‐effectiveness study showed that SMILE (UK) was possibly cost‐effective but was also associated with lower QoL. The process evaluation with 20 participants revealed that a group course increased confidence by sharing with others and improved self‐management behaviours. Conclusions: For people with epilepsy and persistent seizures, a 2‐day self‐management education course is cost‐saving, but does not improve QoL after 12‐months or reduce anxiety or depression symptoms. A psychological intervention may help with anxiety and depression. Interviewed participants reported attending a group course increased their confidence and helped them improve their self‐management.

Early identification of patients who are coping poorly is important for compliance with treatment and control of distress. It is equally important to recognize and diagnose common psychological disorders, primarily anxiety and depressive symptoms, which can occur. Referral for counseling to a mental health professional familiar with the care of patients with cancer may be indicated. My successful confrontation with cancer led to emotional growth.

Proton spectroscopy studies performed in adult bipolar patients assessing prefrontal regions have suggested decreased levels of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), a putative marker of neuronal integrity. In order to examine whether such abnormalities would also be found in younger patients, a 1H spectroscopy study was conducted that focused on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of children and adolescents with bipolar disorder. METHOD: The authors examined the levels of NAA, creatine plus phosphocreatine, and choline-containing molecules in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 14 bipolar disorder patients (mean age=15.5 years, SD=3, eight female) and 18 healthy comparison subjects (mean age=17.3, SD=3.7, seven female) using short echo time, single-voxel in vivo 1H spectroscopy. Absolute metabolite levels were determined using the water signal as an internal reference. RESULTS: Bipolar patients presented significantly lower NAA levels and a significant inverse correlation between choline-containing molecules and number of previous affective episodes. No differences were found for other metabolites. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that young bipolar patients have decreased NAA levels in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, similar to what was previously reported in adult patients. Such changes may reflect an underdevelopment of dendritic arborizations and synaptic connections. These neuronal abnormalities in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of bipolar disorder youth are unlikely to represent long-term degenerative processes, at least in the subgroup of patients where the illness had relatively early onset.",2005.0,10.1176/appi.ajp.162.11.2109,DX6L4IJQ,0,cognitive_additional,1377

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) enables characterisation of white matter tracts that relate to these regions. AIMS: To examine whether DTI measures of anterior cingulate and limbic white matter are useful prognostic biomarkers for MDD. METHOD: Of the 102 MDD out-patients from the International Study to Predict Optimized Treatment for Depression (iSPOT-D) who provided baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, 74 completed an 8-week course of antidepressant medication (randomised to escitalopram, sertraline or extended-release venlafaxine) and were included in the present analyses. Thirty-four matched controls also provided DTI data. Fractional anisotropy was measured for five anterior cingulate-limbic white matter tracts: cingulum cingulate and hippocampus bundle, fornix, stria terminalis and uncinate fasciculus. (Trial registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00693849.) RESULTS: A cross-validated logistic regression model demonstrated that altered connectivity for the cingulum part of the cingulate and stria terminalis tracts significantly predicted remission independent of demographic and clinical measures with 62 \% accuracy. Prediction improved to 74 \% when age was added to this model.

The aim of this study is to determine whether self-efficacy (SE) is associated with onset of depression among workers. Medical expenditure records of 1,803 workers, who were clerks, system engineers, researchers, and service and sales workers in a software development company, were analyzed. Gender, age, job post, marital status, working hours, and SE were measured at baseline. Participants were divided according to quartiles of SE points. Risk ratios for undergoing a medical consultation due to depression were calculated using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. Of the 1,803 participants, 58 underwent medical consultation due to depression during a mean of 1.8 years of follow-up. Compared with the lowest quartile (Q1) of SE, adjusted hazard ratios (HR) were 0.65 (95 \ \% \ CI 0.34-1.25) for Q2, 0.49 (0.24-1.00) for Q3, and 0.40 (0.18-0.88) for Q4.

Recent clinical evidence suggests OT concentrations may be dysregulated in major depression. This study extends previous research by testing whether: 1) OT concentrations vary systematically in depressive disorders with and without hypercortisolemia, 2) gender differences in OT concentrations are observed in depressed vs. healthy control participants, and 3) OT concentrations are predictive of clinical phenotypes. Plasma OT concentrations of psychotic major depressive (PMD; n=14: 10 female, 4 male), non-psychotic major depressive (NPMD; n=17: 12 female, 5 male), and non-depressed, healthy control (n=19: 11 female, 8 male) participants were assayed at 2000, 2400, 0400, and 0800h. Plasma cortisol concentrations were quantified at 2300h, and clinical phenotypes were determined. As expected, PMD participants, compared to NPMD and healthy control participants, showed higher plasma cortisol concentrations. Although both depressed groups showed similar OT concentrations, a significant interaction effect between group and gender was observed. Specifically, depressed females exhibited lower mean OT concentrations than depressed males. Further, depressed vs. healthy control female participants exhibited lower mean OT concentrations, whereas depressed vs. healthy control male participants showed a trend in the opposite direction. OT concentrations were also predictive of desirability, drug dependence, and compulsivity scores as measured by the Million Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III. All findings were independent of cortisol. These data suggest that OT signaling may provide a mechanism by which to better understand female-biased risk to develop depressive disorders and that plasma OT concentrations may be a useful biomarker of certain clinical phenotypes. \textcopyright 2013.",2014.0,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2013.12.012,3FLHN7Z3,0,diathesis,1380
1380,Behavioral activation.,"Farmer, Richard F.; Chapman, Alexander L.","Depression is a common experience among people generally and a frequent concern among persons seeking therapy. A related diagnostic category, major depressive disorder (MDD), has been estimated to have a lifetime risk of approximately 23 \% based on findings from nationally representative cross-sectional samples (Kessler, Berglund, et al., 2005). Longitudinal research with representative birth cohorts, however, suggests that the actual risk is closer to double this amount (Moffitt et al., 2010; Rohde, Lewinsohn, Klein, Seeley, \& Gau, 2013). MDD is also a highly comorbid condition that often co-occurs with other internalizing psychiatric disorders (e.g., Seeley, Kosty, Farmer, \& Lewinsohn, 2011; Watson, 2009) and has been projected to be the second leading cause of disease burden worldwide by 2030 (Mathers \& Loncar, 2006). Depressed mood and loss of interest and pleasure (anhedonia) are core symptoms in the definition of the MDD diagnostic category. In the current editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) and the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (World Health Organization, 1991), at least one of these symptoms should be present for a diagnosis of MDD to be considered. Sad mood and anhedonia are not only central features of MDD, they are also frequent concomitants of several other psychiatric conditions (Dichter, 2010; Nestler et al., 2002). Sad mood, for example, is widely regarded as a nonspecific symptom associated with both depressive and anxiety disorders and, correspondingly, an exemplar of a set of symptoms associated with a general negative affect factor (Watson, 2009). Anhedonia is an experience linked to stress exposure (Agrawal et al., 2012; Nikolova, Bogdan, \& Pizzagalli, 2012) and is also included as a symptom feature of posttraumatic stress disorder in the DSM-5. Whereas general negative affect is frequently associated with avoidance coping (e.g., Borkovec, Alcaine, \& Behar, 2004; Dickson, Ciesla, \& Reilly, 2012; Kashdan, Breen, Afram, \& Terhar, 2010; Trew, 2011), anhedonia is primarily related to a low responsiveness to reward incentives, reduced effort expenditure to obtain rewards, and passivity (e.g., Berton, Hahn, \& Thase, 2012; Treadway, Bossaller, Shelton, \& Zald, 2012). Although the therapeutic change mechanisms underlying behavioral activation therapies remain speculative (e.g., Hunnicutt-Ferguson, Hoxha, \& Gollan, 2012), they are likely tied to the therapy's emphasis on two processes that underlie core symptoms of MDD and other related conditions: avoidance coping and reduced responsiveness to reward incentives.

1381,Efficacy of Quetiapine Fumarate in Affective Symptoms of Schizophrenia,"M, Cantillon; Jm, Goldstein","Affective symptoms are common in patients with schizophrenia and are associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and impaired functioning. Therapies effective in reducing affective symptoms without worsening negative or cognitive symptoms or inducing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) would represent an important advance. 'Seroquel' (quetiapine fumarate), a recently approved antipsychotic, is effective in treating positive and negative symptoms of psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia. Quetiapine is well tolerated and does not produce treatment-emergent or dose-related EPS and does not elevate plasma prolactin levels. We present results from two, six-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, efficacy and safety trials in hospitalized patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. Trial 1 (n = 351) evaluated five fixed doses of quetiapine (75, 150, 300, 600, 750 mg/day) and a single haloperidol dose (12 mg/day); Trial 2 (n = 296) was dose-titrated. Efficacy was assessed using the 18-item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI). Affective symptoms were assessed using the BPRS factor I score (mean of depressive mood, guilt feelings, somatic concern, anxiety) and a BPRS mood cluster score (mean of depressive mood, guilt feelings, anxiety, tension). In both trials, quetiapine was superior to placebo in improving affective symptoms, as assessed by the BPRS factor I and mood cluster scores, while haloperidol (Trial 1) was not (p \textless 0.05). Affective symptoms were improved on both measures in a statistically significantly greater proportion of patients treated with quetiapine than with placebo (Trials 1 and 2) or haloperidol (Trial 1). These results provide evidence that quetiapine is effective in the treatment of affective symptoms associated with schizophrenia and may have a better therapeutic effect in this important area of psychopathology than standard agents. A favorable safety and tolerability profile across the dose range, combined with data supporting efficacy in the treatment of positive, negative, and affective symptoms of schizophrenia, suggest that quetiapine may represent an important advance in the treatment of psychotic disorders.

The theoretical formulations of Ronald Fairbairn are used to show that Richard's villainy preserved and perpetuated a specific object-tie to his mother, that of being her demonized and despised child of hate, and that many of his victims, especially women, served as maternal surrogates in his lifelong quest to replicate his maternal bad-enough object. Similar patterns of severe relational disturbance pervade many of the mother-son dyads portrayed in Shakespeare's other plays, a repetitive theme that may well be linked to the playwright's own mother's history of severe loss and depression during his infancy and its impact on her ability to provide her son with bountiful emotional nurturance. A collateral issue is also addressed-the narcissistically embedded bonding difficulties between parents and their disabled children, whose visible impairment is said to give rise to greater adjustment problems than does the medical severity of the condition itself. \textcopyright 2013 by the American Psychoanalytic Association.",2013.0,,9ZPZKZGW,0,psychodynamic,1383
1383,Some affective consequences of social comparison and reflection processes: The pain and pleasure of being close.,"Tesser, Abraham; Millar, Murray; Moore, Janet","A self-evaluation maintenance (SEM) model of social behavior was described. According to the comparison process, when another outperforms the self on a task high in relevance to the self, the closer the other the greater the threat to self-evaluation. According to the reflection process, when another outperforms the self on a task low in relevance to the self, the closer the other the greater the promise of augmentation to self-evaluation. Affect was assumed to reflect threats and promises to self-evaluation. In 3 studies, Ss were given feedback about own performance and the performance of a close (friend) and distant (stranger) other on tasks that were either low in self-relevance (Study 2) or that varied in self-relevance (Studies 1 and 3). In Study 1 (N = 31), being outperformed by a close other resulted in greater arousal than being outperformed by a distant other. In Study 2 (N = 30), results indicate that when relevance was low, more positive affect was associated with a friend's outperforming the self than either a friend's performing at a level equal to the self or being outperformed by a stranger. In Study 3 (N = 31), pleasantness of expression was an interactive function of relevance of task, relative performance, and closeness of comparison other. All 3 studies are interpreted as being generally consistent with the SEM model. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",,,BAP6DXWX,0,cognitive_additional,1384

M.; Mitby, P.; Moore, I.; Scheurer, M. E.; Hockenberry, M. J.; Pan, W.","BACKGROUND: Children undergoing leukemia treatment report co-occurring symptoms of fatigue, sleep disturbances, pain, nausea, and depression as a symptom cluster. Physical activity (PA) is essential for development and may influence symptom severity. Children with leukemia are at risk of cognitive impairments from central nervous system therapies. Using a longitudinal parallel-process model, relationships among function and symptom clusters were explored. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the longitudinal mediation effects of PA on cognition via a symptom cluster during leukemia treatment. METHODS: Symptoms, PA, and cognitive function of 327 children aged 3 to 18 years were measured over 4 intervals during the first year of leukemia treatment. Children 7 years or older self-reported and parents reported for younger children. Parents completed cognitive function measurements for all children. The influence of the first time point and the subsequent change between all 4 time points of PA on the symptom cluster were explored. Analysis determined whether the symptom cluster mediated the effect of cognition over the treatment period. RESULTS: Patients with a higher PA at time 1 reduced their symptom cluster severity over the measurements. However, when PA increased over the measurements, symptom cluster severity also increased. When the symptom cluster was more severe at time 1, cognitive function was lower at time 1, and cognitive function decreased over time. When symptoms became more severe over time, cognitive function declined. CONCLUSIONS: The symptom cluster acted as a mediator between PA and cognition. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Symptom management during treatment may be an additional strategy for protecting cognitive function.",2018.0,10.1097/ncc.0000000000000634,ESGIBZMY,0,additional,1385
1385,Deficient inhibition of emotional information in depression.,"Goeleven, Ellen and","BACKGROUND: There are numerous indications that impaired inhibition of negative affective material could be an important cognitive component of depression. To study whether impaired inhibition of negative affect is a cognitive vulnerability factor explaining (recurrent) depression, inhibition of positive and negative affective stimuli was examined in hospitalized depressed patients, formerly depressed individuals and never-depressed controls. METHODS: To investigate inhibitory dysfunctions in the processing of emotional material, we used an affective modification of the negative priming task with pictures of sad and happy facial expressions. RESULTS: Compared to never-depressed controls, depressed patients showed a specific failure to inhibit negative information, whereas inhibition function for positive material was unaffected. Surprisingly, formerly depressed individuals demonstrated impaired inhibition of negative and positive information. LIMITATIONS: Because of the significant correlations between depression and anxiety self-report scores, the observed reduced inhibitory effect toward negative material in the depression group cannot strictly be attributed as depression-specific. CONCLUSIONS: In accordance with our hypothesis, strongly impaired inhibition of negative affect was found in depressed patients. Based on the present findings, we argue that impaired inhibition of negative affect could be an important construct in cognitive theories on depression linking cognitive biases to neuropsychological impairments in depression. The data in the formerly depressed individuals are less conclusive and several hypotheses are detailed that could explain how the absence of inhibition of affective information could relate to recurrent depression.",2006.0,10.1016/j.jad.2006.03.007,EYVMN8R6,0,cognitive,1386
1386,Sleep Research and Affective Disorders.,"Wilson, Sue J.; Nutt, David J.","There is a very strong association between sleep and major depression (see Table 15.1). Sleep disturbance is one of the key symptoms of the disease and may be the reason that depressed patients first seek help (Thase, 2000; Agargun et al., 1997a). Up to 95 \% of patients with major depressive episode have at least one complaint of sleep, either difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep or early wakening (Hamilton, 1989; Thase, 1999) and depression-related insomnia seems to be a high risk factor for suicide (Agargun et al., 1997b). As well as subjective symptoms, there are changes in sleep architecture in major depression, and in those patients with recurrent depression who have sleep abnormalities the long-term efficacy of cognitive therapy is reduced (Thase et al., 1998). Antidepressants in general change sleep architecture in the opposite direction to the changes in depression. This alteration in sleep is one of the few consistent and measurable biological effects in this disease, and therefore it is important to study it and the effects of treatment.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the comparative efficacy of transdermal nicotine and nicotine nasal spray and identify predictors of treatment outcome. DESIGN: Randomized, open-label clinical trial with a 6-month follow-up period. SETTING: 2 university-based smoking cessation research programs. PARTICIPANTS: 299 treatment-seeking smokers who were followed for 6 months after the target quit date. INTERVENTION: Behavioral group counseling and 8 weeks of therapy with nicotine nasal spray or transdermal nicotine. MEASUREMENTS: Demographic characteristics, smoking history, depression symptoms, and body mass index were measured at baseline. Smoking practices were biochemically verified at the end of treatment and at 6 months after the target quit date. RESULTS: Abstinence rates for the transdermal nicotine and nicotine nasal spray groups were not significantly different at 6-month follow-up (15.0% vs. 12.2%, respectively; P > 0.2). Interactions in abstinence rates for subgroups of smokers were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Smokers who had low to moderate dependence levels, were not obese, and were white achieved higher abstinence rates with transdermal nicotine, whereas smokers who were highly dependent, obese, or members of minority groups achieved higher abstinence rates with nasal spray. LIMITATIONS: The subgroup findings need confirmation in additional large studies before they are routinely applied. CONCLUSIONS: Ethnicity, weight, and level of nicotine dependence may help identify smokers who have greater or lesser abstinence rates with either transdermal or nasal spray nicotine.",2004.0,10.7326/0003-4819-140-6-200403160-00009,H344DMGR,0,behavior,1388

C.","PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To investigate the differences between various cancer therapies (radiation, hormonal, chemotherapy, and their combinations) and the specific dimensions of fatigue (affective meaning, behavioral/severity, cognitive/mood, and sensory). DESIGN: Descriptive, cross-sectional, mailed survey design. SAMPLE AND SETTING: Data were collected from women who were breast cancer survivors and members of a nonprofit educational organization in the North-east. Criteria for this study included no self-reported disease recurrence, and treatment was within 18 months prior to the mailed survey (N = 322). The typical participant was middle-aged (mean = 52.2; SD = 10.3), Caucasian (93 \% ), postmenopausal (55 \% ), and diagnosed with cancer 2.42 (SD = 2.6) years prior to the study. METHODS: Secondary data analysis from a study using the Piper Fatigue Scale. VARIABLES: Level of fatigue. FINDINGS: Significant differences were found by treatment in total fatigue scores (p \textless 0.03) and cognitive/mood scores (p \textless 0.05). Women who received combination therapy had the highest fatigue scores (mean = 4.8; SD = 2.0); those who received only radiation therapy had the lowest fatigue scores (mean = 2.7; SD = 2.0). CONCLUSIONS: Fatigue in breast cancer survivors varies by type of cancer therapy. Future studies are needed to investigate the relationships between fatigue and hormonal therapy, and they need to be designed to examine changes over time. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Study findings advance knowledge about fatigue in women with breast cancer and aid nurses in providing anticipatory guidance for women undergoing different treatment regimens.",1998.0,,DZX5TWJK,0,cognitive,1389
1389,What predicts suicide among psychologists? An examination of vulnerability and protective factors,"Zuckerman, Stephanie","Background: Research indicates health professionals, particularly psychologists, may be at a uniquely high risk for attempting or committing suicide. Factors predicting increased risk for suicide among the general population (e.g., gender and mental illness) may also increase risk among psychologists. Risk of suicide among psychologists may also be attributable to occupational factors (e.g., burnout or secondary traumatic stress) or their potential for higher levels of past trauma than professionals in other fields. Finally, resilience and meaning in life may serve as protective factors among psychologists. Aims: To examine demographic factors, mental health factors, work factors, past experiences of trauma, and protective factors for their ability to predict suicidality and to examine resilience as a potential moderator of the relationship between vulnerability factors and suicidality. Method: A sample of 172 psychologists anonymously completed online questionnaires; hierarchical multiple regression procedures were used for analysis. Finding: Having a family history of suicide, number of experienced lifetime traumas, and general level of depression/anxiety over the lifetime predicted higher suicidality among psychologists. Resilience was found to moderate the relationship between both family history of suicide and recent anxiety/depression and suicidality such that these relationships were strengthened at higher levels of resilience.

METHODS: Secondary analyses of the intervention arm of the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease (ENRICHD) clinical trial involving persons with acute myocardial infarction (MI): n = 641 for the depression outcomes and n = 523 for the social support outcomes. The outcome measures were, for depression: the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D); for social support: the ENRICHD Social Support Instrument (ESSI) and Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS). RESULTS: Better depression outcomes (measured by the BDI) were receiving a high number of depression-specific intervention components, p \ \textless \ 0.01, and completing a high proportion of homework assignments, p \ \textless \ 0.02. Better depression outcomes (measured by the HAM-D) were receiving a high number of the social communication and assertiveness components of the intervention, p \ \textless \ 0.01, and completing a high proportion of homework assignments, p \ \textless \ 0.01. Better social support outcomes (measured by the ESSI and PSSS) were predicted by membership in a racial or ethnic minority group, p \ \textless \ 0.02 and p \ \textless \ 0.01, respectively; and by completing a higher number of homework assignments, p \ \textless \ 0.01 and p \ \textless \ 0.05, respectively. Delivery of the social communication and assertiveness components of the intervention was an independent predictor of a worse social support outcome, p \ \textless \ 0.01 (measured by the PSSS). CONCLUSIONS: The standard components of CBT for depression are useful in treating comorbid depression in post-MI patients. Working on communication skills may help to improve depression but not necessarily social support outcomes in this patient population, while adherence to cognitive-behavioral homework assignments is important for both outcomes. Other components of the ENRICHD intervention that were designed to improve social support had no discernible effects on outcomes. Intervention refinements may be needed in order to achieve better results in future post-MI clinical trials. A greater emphasis on CBT homework adherence could improve both depression and social support outcomes.",2008.0,10.1159/000110057,DMHR3J6H,0,personality,1391
1391,"V1A antagonist (RG7713) proof of mechanism study in high functioning autism spectrum disorder: Clinical, biomarker and social learning effects","Hollander, E.","The role of histamine as a mediator of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction was examined in intact anesthetized dogs. Antagonism of histamine vasoconstrictor (H1) receptors with a classic antihistaminic drug (chlorpheniramine) failed to prevent or modify the pulmonary vascular responses to hypoxia (10% O2). Blockade of histamine vasodilator (H2) receptors with a newly synthesized blocking agent (metiamide) potentiated the vasoconstriction induced by hypoxia and prevented the normal increase in heart rate. Combined H1- and H2-receptor blockade also did not prevent or reduce the hypoxic pulmonary pressor response, although it did effectively abolish the cardiovascular actions of infused histamine. In other dogs, histamine infused (3.6 mug/kg per min) during hypoxia attenuated the pulmonary vasoconstriction induced by hypoxia. The results imply that, in the dog, histamine does not mediate hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. However, histamine does appear to be released during hypoxia, and it may play a role in modulating the pulmonary vascular responses to hypoxia by opposing the hypoxia induced vasoconstriction. The results also imply that histamine may be responsible for the increase in heart rate during hypoxia.",2014.0,10.1038/npp.2014.279,5RBVZN3P,0,behavior,1392

1393,Cognitive-affective linkages in employee experiences of organizational change.,"Oakes, Karen P.","Many organizational change plans do not achieve desired results and some researchers suggest it is because we have neglected adequate diagnosis (Harrison \& Shirom, 1999) and/or we have left out the people factor (Lawrence, 1969). The current study uses a cross-sectional design to diagnose employee differences in emotional experiences of organizational change. Measures of both negative [ATQ (Netemeyer et al., 2002)] and positive thoughts [ATQ-P (Ingram \& Wisnicki, 1988)] and affect [PANAS (Watson, Clark \& Tellegen, 1988)] were used to calculate employees' states of mind (Schwartz, 1997; Schwartz \& Garamoni, 1986) and to assess cognitive processing [Personal Need for Structure (PNS)] as a possible moderator of affect structure (Reich, Zautra, \& Potter, 2001). Theories of individual change link thoughts to affect but previous research focused on establishing the negative thinking-negative emotion relationship (Beck, 1963, 1964) in clinical settings. The current study extends cognitive model concepts to a new population (organizational employees) and includes study of positive thought-affectivity correlations (in addition to negative). Additionally, the study adds to the discussion in the Positive Psychology literature about development of individual-level, positive affect in the presence of residual negative affect. Results supported the study's hypotheses that positive thoughts are correlated with positive affect (both state and trait) and that negative thoughts are correlated with negative affect (state). However, the findings are not conclusive if cognitive processing (PNS) is a moderator of affect structure; results indicated that the moderator effect may be spurious and instead related to curvilinear relationships. Some evidence, though, supported the hypothesis that employees scoring in the highest quartile on PNS have a bipolar affect structure (PA and NA the same construct). Results also suggest limited usefulness of state of mind (SOM) as a classifying variable as participants' PNS levels are statistically the same in individuals defined as functional and dysfunctional and differences in affect structure in these two groups are not definitive. Implications are discussed for consulting psychologists conducting individual-level assessments to better manage group-level interventions like Appreciative Inquiry (Cooperrider et al., 2000) focused on increasing positive affect and resiliency training (Reivich \& Shatte, 2002) focused on reducing negative affect.

1394,The relationship between stealing and eating disorders: A review,"Baum, A.; Goldner, E. M.","The literature exploring stealing behavior in individuals with an eating disorder is reviewed. Although epidemiological data are lacking, clinical observations and preliminary studies suggest an association between stealing behavior and eating disorders. Stealing appears to be strongly associated with bulimic symptoms in patients with eating disorders, and the presence of stealing behavior may serve as a marker of eating-disorder severity. The apparent connection between the two problems is discussed, and nine putative explanatory factors are examined: starvation-induced mental dysfunction, effects of medications, affective spectrum disorder, personality disorder, psychodynamic features, dissociative phenomena, tension reduction, pseudopubertal impulsivity, and sociocultural influences. Various combinations of these factors may operate in any particular patient. One of the challenges to our current understanding is the scarcity of information regarding the prevalence and distribution of stealing behavior in the general population. Areas for future research are suggested and include epidemiological surveys to investigate the proposed connection between stealing and eating disorders, examination of the effects of legal interventions, systematic study of the treatment of stealing in patients with eating disorders, and longitudinal studies exploring prognostic implications of stealing behavior.",1995.0,,FW9Q9E9H,0,psychodynamic,1395

The sample included 133 Iranian women ranging in age from 17 to 69, residing in the greater Los Angeles area. Subjects completed questionnaires in either English or Farsi. Overall (i.e. global) symptomatology, as well as 9 subtypes of psychopathology were examined. These included depression, anxiety, somatization, obsessive-compulsiveness, paranoia, psychoticism, phobic anxiety, hostility, and interpersonal sensitivity. The study utilized both univariate and multivariate analyses. In the multivariate analyses, the effect of significant demographics were controlled for. The findings indicated that biculturality was related to the best mental health outcomes Assimilation into the host culture was also related to better mental health outcomes but this extended to fewer symptom dimensions. Alienation, whereby the immigrant was not connected to either the home or host culture, was consistently related to worse mental health outcomes. In the realm of coping, planful problem solving was related to better outcomes on all measures of symptomatology. Conversely, escape/avoidance was related to worse outcomes on all measures of symptomatology. It appeared that active, problem focused coping strategies were superior to passive, emotion focused ones. Both coping style and cultural orientation were also found to be distributed along demographic lines. Women displayed different cultural orientations and coping styles depending on their age, education, income, and marital status. The stressful aspects of immigration, as well as its connection to mental health are discussed, as is the social-cultural background of Iranians particularly as it relates to gender roles and symptomatology.

We were interested in the question 'Do alcohol dependent patients with different co-occurring mental and medical conditions significantly differ in subjective attributes of well-being and in abstinence rate two years after the end of intensive alcohol dependency treatment'. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 222 ex - patients participated in the research 24 months after the end of intensive alcohol dependency treatment, 74 \ \% \ of them males (mean age = 46.17, SD = 8.79) and 26 \ \% \ females (mean age = 46.35, SD = 8.10). RESULTS: No significant differences were found in any dependent variable regarding any independent variable in presence of any somatic diagnose (yes/no) and personality disorders . Depressive vs. non depressive differed significantly only in the evaluation of important interpersonal relations, while anxious vs. non - anxious and benzodiazepine dependent vs. nondependent significantly differed in all self - evaluations, except in evaluation of important interpersonal relations. No significant differences were found between (non)abstinents regarding any of six categories of mental disorder and medical conditions (yes/no) and no significant differences were found in any self - evaluation regarding the participation in different kinds of after-care. A greater number of patients continued to abstain from alcohol if they continued in aftercare 24 months after the end of intensive treatment. CONCLUSION: Patients with different somatic and mental co-occurring disorders did not differ in abstinence rate. However, membership in after-care 24 months after the end of intensive therapy significantly contributed to the abstinence rate. Abstinence was found to be connected with more positive self-evaluation.

1398,Our shaken collective self-esteem,"Clemens, N. A.","How can psychotherapists best work with patients suffering in the aftermath of the recent devastating economic meltdown and deal with our shaken collective and individual self-esteem? Working with patients who have lost their jobs or their nest eggs, or whose retirement is imperiled, involves addressing the dynamics of mourning. Patients may be experiencing disbelief, shock, anger, and denial of the immensity of the loss, as well as shame and humiliation at their vulnerability. At the same time, because we personally may be confronting many of the same fears and uncertainties, it is important that we as therapists avoid overly identifying with our patients and failing to treat them as individuals in their own right. The author discusses strategies for addressing patients' defenses, a tendency to catastrophize and give way to panic, a sense of narcissistic injury, and anger directed at the people they blame for the economic collapse as well as at themselves for having gotten in over their heads. Using Kohut's concepts of a developmental line of narcissism, therapy may reinforce mature self-esteem while helping patients work through their emotions and come to terms with their new realities. Optimally, they can find new resources within themselves and grow in their ability to value relationships with others.

Background: Olfactory threshold has been suggested to be a marker of inflammatory disease activity in multiple sclerosis. Design/Methods: In this prospective, two-year observational study, 103 patients with RRMS were included. Olfactory threshold was assessed using the Sniffin' Sticks. Results were correlated with age, sex, duration of disease, relapses, expanded disability status scale (EDSS), disease-modifying treatment (DMT), depression, smoking and cognitive function (measured by single digit modalities test, SDMT) by multivariate regression models. Results: Olfactory threshold at baseline was negatively correlated to number of relapses in the subsequent 12 months (r=-0.413; p<0.0001) but not in the subsequent 24 months (r=-0.125; p=0.167) nor to age, disease duration, depression, smoking, EDSS or SDMT. Threshold at month 12 was negatively correlate to occurence of relapse between month 12 and 24 (r=-0.399; p<0.0001). Baseline olfactory threshold did not predict threshold at month 12 or 24, neither did threshold at month 12 predict threshold at month 24. Compared to low-effective DMTs (interferon beta, glatirameracetate, dimethylfumarate) patients receiving high-effective DMTs (natalizumab, fingolimod) had better olfactory thresholds at baseline, month 12 and month 24.

THE AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate frequency of apathy in acute stroke, existence of relations between apathy score and stroke location, and between apathy score and depression with irritability as a differentiate factor between them. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 90 patients in age from 28 to 72 years (mean age=53 years) with acute stroke (in the 6th day after stroke onset) were examined. Stroke location was established by the computer tomography method. Evaluation of emotional disorders was made by means of the Starkstein's apathy scale, the ICD-10 organic depression diagnosis, the Hamilton's depression scale, the Hamilton's anxiety scale and the visual irritability analogue scale. Cognitive disorders were diagnosed by means of Mini Mental State. The intervariables relations were estimated by ANOVA and MANOVA. RESULTS: apathy was diagnosed in 71 \% of patients, and depression in 43 \% of patients. Significant relations between apathy score and stroke location in internal carotid artery territory, and between apathy and a low score in Mini Mental State were identified. There wasn't relation between depression and stroke location, but intensity of irritability was higher in the patients with stroke in vertebrobasilar system territory. This work didn't demonstrated any relations between apathy score and depression (also when irritability was implemented as a covariate), or between apathy score and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: apathy occurs in 71 \% of acute stroke patients, and mainly takes place in patients with stroke in internal carotid artery territory.

1402,Social skills and social problem solving as stress protective factors in childhood depression.,"Goetz, Cameron Allen","This study examined the relationship between stressful life events, social skills, social problem-solving, and depression. A primary goal was to expand cognitive diathesis-stress models of childhood depression to include interpersonal variables such as social skills and social problem-solving. These variables are two components of the more general construct of social competence, one primarily cognitive and the other behavioral in nature, which have been shown in the literature to be related to psychological adjustment in general, and to depression in particular. A second goal of the study was to address the role of social skills and social problem solving as potential moderating, or stress buffering variables in the relation between stressful life events and depression. The concept of a moderator variable in understanding adjustment originates from what we know about the relationship between stress and psychological outcomes-that children do not respond uniformly to stressful life events. Those factors that allow certain children to effectively cope with the negative effects of stress may be said to be stress protective factors that aid in the prevention of maladaptive outcomes such as depression. These goals were examined in a clinical sample of 40 adolescents receiving treatment at a residential treatment center. Participants completed paper and pencil measures of social skills (Matson Evaluation of Social Skills with Youngsters), social problem-solving (Social Problem Solving Inventory-Revised), and stressful life events (Life Events Checklist), and a semi-structured diagnostic interview (Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia). Contrary to predicted hypotheses, no association was found between stressful life events and depression or between social skills deficits and depression. Neither social skills nor social problem-solving were found to moderate the relationship between stress and depression, thus not supporting the proposed stress-buffering hypothesis. However, consistent with cognitive-interpersonal theories of depression, results demonstrate that several aspects of social problem-solving are related to depression in this sample of adolescents. Specifically, the cognitive and affective manner in which an individual approaches the problem solving process impacts subsequent adjustment with regard to depression. In addition, youth who adopt a more rational problem solving approach to problems were less likely to experience depressive symptomatology.

1403,Updated guidelines for the management of sports-related concussion in general practice.,"Makdissi, Michael; Davis, Gavin; McCrory, Paul","BACKGROUND: Concussion is common in many sports and recreational activities. It is thought to reflect a functional rather than structural injury to the brain. The clinical features are typically short-lived and usually resolve spontaneously. Complications, however, can occur and may include prolonged symptoms and/or cognitive deficits in the short term, as well as depression and cumulative deterioration in brain function in the longer term. OBJECTIVE: This article will provide an updated clinical review of concussion in sport, with an emphasis on assessment and management in general practice. DISCUSSION: The critical issues in the clinical management of concussion in sport include making a diagnosis, differentiating between concussion and other pathologies (particularly structural head injury), recognising the presence of any modifying factors (which may increase the risk of complications) and determining when the patient can safely return to competition. The key components of safe return-to-play decisions include rest, neuropsychological testing and a graded program of exertion before return to sport.",2014.0,,WYSPN9SN,0,cognitive,1404
1404,Depression and allied illness in children and adolescents: Basic facts,"Bhardwaj, A.; Goodyer, I. M.","Unipolar depression is a relatively common psychiatric condition in young people. Clinical signs and symptoms at presentation can vary with age, with children showing different characteristics to adolescents. Depressive episodes before 18 years of age are associated with increased risk of recurrence into adulthood, with some early-onset cases showing a chronic course into adult life. Both recurrent and chronic cases in young adulthood are associated with long-term suffering and impairment. Depressive episodes invariably present with a range of other non-depressive disorders, such that co-morbid presentation is the rule rather than the exception. These early-onset depressions are heterogeneous in their origins and outcomes. Treatment of a depressive episode results in full remission in about two-thirds of cases, but we know little of the effects of treatment on subsequent relapse and recurrence. A better understanding of the causes and the pathophysiology of these disorders would greatly inform treatment decision-making and public health policy. \textcopyright 2009 The Association for Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy in the NHS.",2009.0,,R2IYB4IL,0,psychodynamic,1405
1405,The minimum data set depression quality indicator: does it reflect differences in care processes?,"Simmons, S. F.; Cadogan, M. P.; Cabrera, G. R.; Al-Samarrai, N. R.; Jorge, J. S.; Levy-Storms, L.; Osterweil, D.; Schnelle, J. F.","PURPOSE: The objective of this work was to determine if nursing homes that score differently on prevalence of depression, according to the Minimum Data Set (MDS) quality indicator, also provide different processes of care related to depression. DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study with 396 long-term residents in 14 skilled nursing facilities was conducted: 10 homes in the lower (25th percentile: low prevalence 0-2 \% ) quartile and 4 homes in the upper (75th percentile: high prevalence 12-14 \% ) quartile on the MDS depression quality indicator. Ten care processes related to depression were defined and operationalized into clinical indicators. Measurement of nursing home staff implementation of each care process and the assessment of depressive symptoms were conducted by trained research staff during 3 consecutive 12-hr days (7 a.m. to 7 p.m.), which included resident interviews (Geriatric Depression Scale), direct observations, and medical record review using standardized protocols. RESULTS: The prevalence of depressive symptoms according to independent assessments was significantly higher than prevalence based on the MDS quality indicator and comparable between homes reporting low versus high rates of depression (46 \% and 41 \% , respectively). Documentation of depressive symptoms was significantly more common in homes reporting a high prevalence rate; however, documentation of symptoms on the MDS did not result in better treatment or management of depression according to any care-process measure. Psychosocial prevention and intervention efforts, such as resident participation in organized social group activities, were not widely used within either group of homes. IMPLICATIONS: The MDS depression quality indicator underestimates the prevalence of depressive symptoms in all homes but, in particular, among those reporting low or nonexistent rates. The indicator may be more reflective of measurement processes related to detection of symptoms than of prevention, intervention, or management of depression outcomes. A depression quality indicator should not be eliminated from MDS reports because of the importance and prevalence of the condition. However, efforts to improve nursing home staff detection of depressive symptoms should be initiated prior to the use of any MDS-based depression indicator for improvement purposes. Homes that report a low prevalence of depression according to the nationally publicized MDS quality indicator should not be regarded as providing better care.",2004.0,,PEE3TE2G,0,cognitive_additional,1406

M.; Bonas, T.; Hall, S. M.","In 8 male patients who were treated with perazine for a schizophrenic psychosis (200-800 mg/die), the elimination rate of phenazone was investigated. Simultaneously determinations of plasma levels of perazine and desmethylperazine were carried out. The average half-life of phenazone was 27.0 h in perazine-treated patients and 11.2 h in controls. Correspondingly, the clearance of phenazone decreased from 47.0 ml/min to 18.9 ml/min under perazine, both differences being highly significant. The amount of 4-OH-phenazone, the principal hydroxylated metabolite excreted in the urine, was 66 mg/24 h in the perazine group, and significantly different from the results obtained in the control group: 185 mg/24 h. In contrast the urinary excretion of the unchanged phenazone increased from 29 to 40 mg/24 h under perazine.

F. and","OBJECTIVE: Given the debate around limitations and controversies in type D personality studies, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of 'synergistically' analyzed type D personality (interaction z-scores negative affectivity NA, and social inhibition SI) on 10-year mortality and on 10-year subjective health status in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) patients. METHODS: This prospective study comprised a cohort of 1190 consecutive patients who underwent PCI between October 2001 and September 2002 (73 \ \% \ male, mean age: 62years, range [27-90]years). At baseline, type D personality (DS14), and depression/anxiety (HADS) were assessed. Primary endpoint was 10year all-cause mortality; secondary endpoint was 10-year subjective health status (SF-36). RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 10.3years (IQR 9.8-10.8), 293 deaths of any cause (24.6 \ \% \ ) were recorded. After adjustment for significant baseline characteristics, personality categories approached and dichotomously approached type D personality were associated with 10-year mortality, p \ \textless \ .05. Synergistically approached type D personality was not associated with all-cause mortality or subjective health status at 10years. In survivors, higher NA was associated with lower subjective health status. Type D was not associated with mortality after adjusting for continuous depression and anxiety in all approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Synergistically analyzed type D was not associated with 10-year all-cause mortality in PCI patients whereas dichotomous type D was. However, after adjustment for depression most of the findings had disappeared. Depression played an important role in this. Type D was not associated with 10-year subjective health status.",2015.0,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2015.05.014,255TSSGE,0,personality,1408
1408,Urinary cortisol and catecholamines in mothers of child cancer survivors with and without PTSD,"Glover, D. A.; Poland, R. E.","Reduced cortisol coupled with elevated catecholamines has been reported for patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) precipitated by war and other traumas considered to be outside the range of usual experiences . It is unclear whether these neuroendocrine abnormalities also occur in PTSD precipitated by more commonly experienced traumas associated with life-threatening illness. Overnight (12-h) urinary cortisol, norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) were measured in 21 mothers of pediatric cancer survivors with (n = 14) and without PTSD symptoms (n = 7) and in control mothers of healthy children (n = 8). Mothers meeting subthreshold and full PTSD criteria were combined to form the PTSD symptoms group. The PTSD group showed lower total urinary cortisol and a trend for higher total urinary NE than the non-PTSD group, who in turn were no different from controls. There were no significant group effects for E. Cortisol (but not NE) effects remained after controlling for symptoms of co-morbid depression. The finding of reduced cortisol in illness-related PTSD demonstrates neuroendocrine dysregulation similar to that found previously in other types of trauma (e.g., war-related). Future longitudinal studies with repeated urinary collection procedures will be necessary to clarify measurement issues and establish the time course and health implications of the neuroendocrine perturbations. \textcopyright 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

M.; Gibson, P.; Boardman, D.; Gori, A.; Castelnuovo, G.","Introduction: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling psychopathology. The mainstay of treatment includes cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and medication management. However, individual suffering, functional impairments as well as the direct and indirect costs associated with the disease remain substantial. New treatment programmes are necessary and the brief strategic therapy (BST) has recently shown encouraging results in clinical practice but no quantitative study has as yet been conducted. Methods and analysis: The clinical effectiveness of the OCD-specific BST protocol will be evaluated in a one-group observational study. Participants will be sequentially recruited from a state community psychotherapy clinic in Dublin, Ireland. Outcome measures will be the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Data will be collected at baseline, at treatment termination and at 3 month follow-up. The statistical significance of the post-treatment effect will be assessed by the paired-sample Student t test, while clinical significance will be evaluated by means of the equivalence testing method, which will be also used to assess the maintenance of effect at follow-up. Ethics/dissemination: The present study is approved by the Hesed House Ethics Board in Dublin. Findings will enhance the evidence-based knowledge about the clinical effectiveness of BST in treating OCD symptoms, prior to assessing its efficacy in a randomised and controlled clinical trial, and will be disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations.",2016.0,,7SS2E7CZ,0,behavior,1410

C.","OBJECTIVE: This prospective study assesses the roles of illness beliefs, emotion regulation factors, and sociodemographic characteristics in decisions to participate in a group support program for women recently diagnosed with breast cancer. METHOD: Women recruited during clinic visits 2 to 4 weeks after diagnosis completed measures of affective and cognitive factors identified by Leventhal's Common-Sense Model of illness self-regulation: cancer-related distress, avoidance tendencies, beliefs that the breast cancer was caused by stress and altered immunity, and personal control beliefs. Measures of general anxiety and depression, social support, and demographic characteristics were also completed; prognostic status information was obtained from medical records. All women were encouraged to participate in a free, 12-week program offering coping skills training and group support. Participation was recorded by program staff. RESULTS: Of the 110 women, 54 (49 \% ) participated in the group support program and 56 (51 \% ) did not. Logistic regression analyses revealed that participation was predicted by stronger beliefs that the cancer was caused by altered immunity, higher cancer-related distress, lower avoidance tendencies, and younger age. CONCLUSIONS: Participation in the group psychosocial support program appeared to be guided by cognitive and affective factors identified by the Common-Sense Model. Psychosocial support programs and informational materials promoting their use may attract more participants if they are tailored to focus on resolving cancer-related distress rather than on general anxiety or depression, appeal to those with high avoidance tendencies, address the role of immune function in cancer progression, and meet the needs of older participants.",2005.0,10.1097/01.psy.0000170834.54970.f5,AZCN47S2,0,cognitive,1411

J.; Abraldes, J.; Tandon, P.","INTRODUCTION: Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is the most common potentially modifiable reason for admission in patients with cirrhosis. Cognitive and physical components of frailty have pathophysiologic rationale as risk factors for HE. We aimed to assess the utility of a composite score (MoCA-CFS) developed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) for predicting HE admissions within 6 months. METHODS: Consecutive adult patients with cirrhosis were followed for 6 months or until death/transplant. Patients with overt HE and dementia were excluded. Primary outcome was the prediction of HE-related admissions at 6 months. RESULTS: A total of 355 patients were included; mean age 55.9 +/- 9.6; 62.5% male; Hepatitis C and alcohol etiology in 64%. Thirty-six percent of patients had cognitive impairment according to the MoCA (</=24) and 14% were frail on the CFS (>4). The MoCA-CFS independently predicted HE hospitalization within 6 months, a MoCA-CFS score of 1 and 2 respectively increasing the odds of hospitalization by 3.3 (95% CI:1.5-7.7) and 5.7 (95% CI:1.9-17.3). HRQoL decreased with increasing MoCA-CFS. Depression and older age were independent predictors of a low MoCA. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive and physical frailty are common in patients with cirrhosis. In addition to being an independent predictor of HE admissions within 6 months, the MoCA-CFS composite score predicts impaired HRQoL and all-cause admissions within 6 months. These data support the predictive value of a ""multidimensional"" frailty tool for the prediction of adverse clinical outcomes and highlight the potential for a multi-faceted approach to therapy targeting cognitive impairment, physical frailty and depression.",2018.0,10.1038/s41395-018-0243-0,U92TM6EH,0,additional,1412
1412,A Modern Classic: The Psychiatric Interview in Clinical Practice.,"Hong, Barry A.","Reviews the book, The Psychiatric Interview in Clinical Practice (2nd ed.) by Roger A. MacKinnon, Robert Michels, and Peter J. Buckley (see record 2006-08289-000). According to Hong, this book is a primer about the interviewing skills of mental health professionals and patients. These clinical chapters go far beyond giving advice for getting the right diagnosis and the enumeration of criterion-based symptoms, and they get to the person behind the diagnosis. Although there are three authors, they write with a common voice that reveals shared, universal principles of patient care. One of the unique features of the book is that it uses the personality diagnoses that originated in the earlier DSM references. The current criteria for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.) personality diagnoses also are provided in the text. Patients with all of the major personality disorders are discussed, including patients who are obsessive-compulsive, histrionic, narcissistic, depressed, antisocial, paranoid patient, psychotic, or psychosomatic; have anxiety disorder; have experienced trauma; have borderline personality disorder; or are cognitively impaired. Hong notes that this book covers with great skill and sensitivity major issues in psychotherapy and the management of patients. It is written from a psychodynamic point of view, which may be an obstacle for some readers, but it should be of interest and value to psychotherapists of all orientations.

A.","Depression and alcohol use disorder (AUD) commonly co-occur, and this comorbidity is associated with greater impairment and higher likelihood of relapse compared to either disorder alone. Identifying shared vulnerability across depression and AUD may aid in developing more parsimonious treatment approaches. Low levels of positive reinforcement for healthy behaviors have been implicated as a shared vulnerability across both depression and AUD. However, prior research in this area has largely been conducted among college students and has rarely examined depression and AUD symptoms together. This study aims to extend prior literature by examining the association between both the frequency and enjoyment of activities and AUD symptoms in a national sample of adults (n = 609) while also accounting for depressive symptoms. Study results indicated that low levels of enjoyment were associated with greater alcohol-related problems and frequency of heavy episodic drinking, above and beyond depressive symptoms. The frequency of potentially pleasurable activities was unrelated to alcohol-related problems or heavy episodic drinking. Findings extend prior literature by providing evidence for the association between enjoyment of activities and alcohol use, above and beyond depressive symptoms, among a national sample of adults. These results suggest that prioritizing enjoyment of activities, rather than frequency, may be important for behavioral intervention efforts to address heavy drinking and associated problems. Future longitudinal research using observational methods of behavior is needed to identify causal relationships between activity enjoyment and AUD symptoms.",2017.0,10.1037/adb0000220,WKR3FCP9,0,additional,1415
1415,Effects of completing sexual questionnaires in males and females with histories of childhood sexual abuse: Implications for institutional review boards,"Rojas, A.; Kinder, B. N.","Few studies have sought to examine empirically the immediate effects of participation in sexual abuse research. The present study investigated the effects of childhood sexual abuse on measures of personality and psychological functioning in 250 males and females. The null hypothesis was that sexually abused and nonabused groups would show no significant differences between pre-and post-testing on measures of state anxiety, state depression, and state anger. No significant differences between pre-and post-testing were observed between nonabused, abused, and severely abused participants. In addition, there were no gender differences among the groups. Findings from this study support those of Savell, Kinder, and Young (2006) and have significant implications for Institutional Review Boards (IRB) as they suggest that participation in childhood sexual abuse or sexuality research does not place sexually abused individuals at greater than minimal risk for immediate increases in anxiety, depression, or anger.

Based on previous studies demonstrating that depression and materialism are linked with CB, in addition, the Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-9) and the Materialistic Values Scale (MVS) were administered. CBS scores were significantly correlated with the MVS, PHQ-9, and BAS scores. The findings of the hierarchical regression analysis, however, indicated that in the present sample of treatment-seeking patients the only significant association was found between CB and depression. The results highlight the prominent role of depression in CB.

R.","Transport properties of brush border microvilli and basal-lateral plasma membranes isolated from rat kidney cortex were studied by a millipore filtration technique. Brush border microvilli but not basal-lateral plasma membranes contain sodium dependent stereospecific transport system for D-glucose, L-phenylalanine and inorganic phosphate as indicated by saturability, countertransport and inhibition by structurally related compounds. Reduction of equilbrium uptake by increasing medium osmolarity suggests transport into an osmotically reactive space rather than binding to the membranes. Electrogenecity of the sodium-sugar and sodium-amino-acid cotransport system was established by their dependence on artificially imposed diffusion potentials. Also a NA+/H+ antiport system can be demonstrated in microvilli vesicles by demonstrating counterflow of both ions under short circuit conditions. Basal-lateral plasma membranes contain sodium independent stereospecific transport systems for sugars and amino acids. These results demonstrate a marked functional polarity of the cell membranes in respect to sodium dependent and sodium independent transport systems. This polarity in conjunction with the asymmetrical distribution of sodium between the intra- and extracellular space seems to enable the proximal tubule epithelial cells to perform active transepithelial transport.",2005.0,10.1007/s10464-005-6231-8,YIXAW5SM,0,personality,1418

In contrast to previous research, we were interested not only in specific pain coping but also in more general stress coping strategies and their potential influence on pain outcomes. Analyses were performed using correlation and regression analyses. ""Praying and hoping"" turned out to be an independent predictor of higher pain intensity and higher anxiety levels, whereas both ""coping self-instructions"" and ""diverting attention"" were associated with higher well-being, less feelings of helplessness, and less depression and anxiety. We further found a link between ""focusing on and venting emotions"" and ""worse pain adjustment"". No significant relationship between dyadic coping and social support with any of our pain outcomes could be observed. Overall, our results indicate that individual coping strategies outweigh the effects of social support and dyadic coping on pain-related outcomes and pain adjustment.

E.","Purpose: To examine the prevalence of persons at risk for depression among family caregivers of visually impaired persons and the extent to which social problem-solving abilities are associated with caregiver depressive symptomatology and life satisfaction. Methods: Family caregivers were defined as adults who accompanied their adult relative to an appointment at a low-vision rehabilitation clinic and self-identified themselves as the primary family caregiver responsible for providing some form of assistance for their relative due to vision impairment. Demographic variables, depressive symptoms, life satisfaction, caregiver burden, and social problem-solving abilities were assessed in caregivers. The patient's visual acuity and depressive symptoms and their relationship to the caregiver's depressive symptoms and life satisfaction were also examined. Results: Ninety-six family caregivers were enrolled. Of those, 35.4 \% were identified as at risk for depression. Among caregivers, dysfunctional or ineffective social problem-solving abilities were significantly associated with greater depressive symptomatology and decreased life satisfaction after adjustment for caregiver burden and demographic and medical variables for both the caregiver and the visually impaired patient. Problem orientation or motivation to solving problems was also significantly associated with caregiver depression and satisfaction with life. Conclusions: A substantial number of caregivers of visually impaired adults experience psychosocial distress, particularly among those who possess poor social problem-solving abilities. These results underscore the need for routine screening and treatment of emotional distress among individuals caring for relatives with vision impairments. Future research should examine the extent to which psychosocial interventions targeting caregiver social problem-solving skills may be useful not only in improving caregiver quality of life but also in subsequently enhancing rehabilitation outcomes for the visually impaired care recipient. \textcopyright Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology.",2009.0,,952VUYHQ,0,behavior,1422

Previous reviews of interventions have been inconclusive as existing trials have been under powered and done on unrepresentative populations. These reviews have however indicated that problem solving therapy and regular written communications after the self-harm attempt may be an effective treatment. This protocol describes a large pragmatic trial of a package of measures which include problem solving therapy, regular written communication, patient support, cultural assessment, improved access to primary care and a risk management strategy in people who present to hospital after self-harm using a novel design. METHODS: We propose to use a double consent Zelen design where participants are randomised prior to giving consent to enroll a large representative cohort of patients. The main outcome will be hospital attendance following repetition of self-harm, in the 12 months after recruitment with secondary outcomes of self reported self-harm, hopelessness, anxiety, depression, quality of life, social function and hospital use at three months and one year. DISCUSSION: A strength of the study is that it is a pragmatic trial which aims to recruit large numbers and does not exclude people if English is not their first language. A potential limitation is the analysis of the results which is complex and may underestimate any effect if a large number of people refuse their consent in the group randomised to problem solving therapy as they will effectively cross over to the treatment as usual group. However the primary analysis is a true intention to treat analysis of everyone randomised which includes both those who consent and do not consent to participate in the study. This provides information about how the intervention will work in practice in a representative population which is a major advance in this study compared to what has been done before.

M.; Griffith, B. P.","This study examines psychological symptomatology in a cohort of 72 heart transplant recipients followed longitudinally during their first year post-transplant. In keeping with research on other domains of life stressors and illnesses, a central study goal was to identify pre-transplant and perioperative psychosocial factors associated with increased vulnerability to, and maintenance of, elevated psychological distress levels post-transplant. Average anxiety and depression levels, but not anger-hostility symptoms, were substantially elevated in the early post-transplant period, relative to normative data. Average symptom levels improved significantly over time, although one-third of the sample continued to have high distress levels at all follow-up assessments. Recipients with any of seven psychosocial characteristics at initial interview were particularly susceptible to continued high average distress levels over time: a personal history of psychiatric disorder prior to transplant; younger age; lower social support from their primary family caregiver; exposure to recent major life events involving loss; poor self-esteem; a poor sense of mastery; and use of avoidance coping strategies to manage health problems. Recipients without such factors showed improvement in average distress levels across the assessment period. These effects were stronger for anxiety than depressive symptoms, with the exception of a sizeable relationship between loss events and subsequent depression. The findings suggest that clinical interventions designed to minimize prolonged emotional distress post-transplant need to be closely tailored to heart recipients' initial psychosocial assets and liabilities.",1994.0,,HTSPLQQ9,0,diathesis,1424
1424,"The relationship between the big five personality traits, impulsivity, and anabolic steroid use","Garcia-Argibay, Miguel","Background: The increase in the prevalence of anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) use has been the subject of study in the last decades. Several studies indicated a strong association between the use of AAS and the performance of risky behaviors mediated by factors such as aggression, impulsivity, depression, and anxiety. Objective: This study aimed to identify differences in personality trait, impulsivity, and the ability to delay gratification between AAS users and non-users that predispose or serve as a buffering mechanism against its usage and whether it is related to an increased likelihood of engaging in infidelity. Methods: Two hundred and twelve male volunteers (88 AAS users), aged between 21 and 36 years (M = 28.22), completed self-report measures of personality, impulsivity, delayed gratification, and attitudes toward infidelity. Multivariate analysis of variance and logistic regression were conducted to establish differences between AAS users and non-users. Results: The results showed that AAS users displayed an inability to delay gratification, a greater impulsivity, and a more benevolent attitude toward infidelity. AAS users obtained higher scores on openness and neuroticism, which was larger ""off-cycle,"" although they presented lower scores on extraversion compared to the non-users group. Regression analysis revealed that neuroticism, impulsivity, and delaying gratification scores were significant predictors of AAS usage. In addition, impulsivity functioned as a partial mediator in the relationship between neuroticism and AAS use. Conclusion: The results of this research highlight a pivotal implication of impulsivity in AAS use in conjunction with neuroticism, openness, and extraversion traits.

1425,The role of psychosocial stress in the onset and progression of bipolar disorder and its comorbidities: the need for earlier and alternative modes of therapeutic intervention.,"Post, R. M.; Leverich, G. S.","Psychosocial stress plays an important role at multiple junctures in the onset and course of bipolar disorder. Childhood adversity may be a risk factor for vulnerability to early onset illness, and an array of stressors may be relevant not only to the onset, recurrence, and progression of affective episodes, but the highly prevalent substance abuse comorbidities as well. A substantial group of controlled studies indicate that various cognitive behavioral psychotherapies and psychoeducational approaches may yield better outcomes in bipolar disorder than treatment as usual. Yet these approaches do not appear to be frequently or systematically employed in clinical practice, and this may contribute to the considerable residual morbidity and mortality associated with conventional treatment. Possible practical approaches to reducing this deficit (in an illness that is already underdiagnosed and undertreated even with routine medications) are offered. Without the mobilization of new clinical and public health approaches to earlier and more effective treatment and supportive interventions, bipolar illness will continue to have grave implications for many patients' long-term well being.",2006.0,10.1017/S0954579406060573,BQNGKJY9,0,cognitive,1426

Other theoretical frameworks (Blatt, 1974) have made similar suggestions. We investigated the differential relations of sociotropy and autonomy to dimensional scores for each DSM-III-R personality disorder (PD) in a sample of 188 psychiatric patients, controlling for the other set of characteristics and for the other PDs. Histrionic and dependent PD traits were related specifically to sociotropy. Paranoid, schizoid, schizotypal, and passive-aggressive PD traits were related specifically to autonomy. Borderline, narcissistic, avoidant, and self-defeating PD traits were related significantly and about equally to both sociotropy and autonomy. Obsessive-compulsive PD traits were not related consistently to either. Results were mostly as predicted and suggest that sociotropy and autonomy may be useful constructs for understanding and treating PDs.",2002.0,,ISN2Z3RK,0,personality,1428

Cognitive therapists assume that changing cognition is the key to bringing about changes in emotional reactions and symptomatic behaviors. This article examines evidence that is not consistent with the assumptions of cognitive therapy. First, neurobiological evidence is not consistent with the assumption that cognitions are necessary for emotions. Limbic structures allow for the possibility that emotions can be experienced without cortical processing. Second, research indicates that experiences can be stored as isolated affective fragments that distort cognitive functions. The assumptions of contemporary psychoanalytic models of therapy are consistent with this evidence.",2001.0,,WTAEBEMM,0,psychodynamic,1429

Measures within 1 month post-crime included previous physical and sexual abuse in childhood and responses to the current crime, including shame and anger with self and others. When all variables were considered together, shame and anger with others were the only independent predictors of PTSD symptoms at 1 month, and shame was the only independent predictor of PTSD symptoms at 6 months when 1-month symptoms were controlled. The results suggest that both shame and anger play an important role in the phenomenology of crime-related PTSD and that shame makes a contribution to the subsequent course of symptoms. The findings are also consistent with previous evidence for the role of shame as a mediator between childhood abuse and adult psychopathology.",2000.0,,INE55GRX,0,cognitive,1430

At 18-mo follow-up, a questionnaire was completed by 227 veterans who met a set case definition for symptoms in Cambodia veterans or who had sub-threshold scores. Initial measurement of fatigue severity, psychological well-being, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), trait-anxiety, self-efficacy, and causal attributions was used to evaluate predictors for self-reported improvement and low levels of fatigue at follow-up. 19 \% of the Ss reported complete recovery, 20 \% felt much better, 57 \% had the same complaints and 4 \% had become worse compared with their initial assessment. Self-reported improvement and less severe fatigue at follow-up were predicted by less severe fatigue at initial assessment and more perceived control over symptoms. Self-reported improvement was reported in a considerable percentage of Ss, whereas another substantial percentage of Ss continued to suffer with severe levels of fatigue and related symptoms. Predictors of improvement in Cambodia veterans and patients with chronic fatigue syndrome show similarities and also may bear importance for Gulf War veterans.

L.; Kiuttu, J.; Joukamaa, M.; Hintsa, T.; Tuulio-Henriksson, A.","BACKGROUND: Research on interventions improving psychological adjustment has suggested that sense of coherence (SOC) could be improved. AIMS: In the present study, we measured the impact of an intervention on the SOC among adults with first-episode depression. We also examined whether rehabilitation, depression, occupational stressors, life situation stressors and socio-demographic characteristics are associated with a change in the SOC. METHODS: Occupational health care clients were screened for depression using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and a structured clinical interview (the The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV: SCID-I). The participating subjects were randomized into a rehabilitation group (n = 134) and control group (n = 100) receiving treatment as usual. The Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC-13) was used at the baseline and in a 1-year follow-up to compare the change of the SOC between the groups. RESULTS: The increase in the mean SOC score was statistically significant both in the rehabilitation group (54.91 compared with 62.85, P < 0.001) and in the control group (55.29 compared with 61.64, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the mean SOC scores between the groups at the follow-up. The improved SOC was associated with less severe depression (P = 0.003) and greater decreasing in BDI (P = 0.041) in the rehabilitation group. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that both rehabilitation and conventional depression treatment in a first episode of depression may enhance the SOC and that rehabilitation itself enhances the SOC more effectively among those with less severe depression or those whose BDI scores had further decreased at the 1-year follow-up.",2015.0,10.3109/08039488.2015.1011230,D7CLT42T,0,personality,1432

S.","BACKGROUND: The association of depression with coronary heart disease-related mortality has been widely recognized. This finding may partly reflect an association between depression and sudden death, in part because the imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic tone is altered in depressed subjects. We, thus, investigated whether the presence and severity of clinical depression was associated with a higher risk of sudden cardiac death. METHODS: We used data from a population-based case-control study of risk factors for incident out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (CA) conducted among enrollees of a health maintenance organization in western Washington State. Cases (n = 2228) were aged 40 to 79 years and experienced CA between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 1994. Controls (n = 4164) were a stratified random sample of enrollees defined by calendar year, age, sex, and prior heart disease. Clinical depression was defined as physician diagnosis of depression or use of antidepressant treatment within the year before the event. Referral to mental health clinics or hospitalization for depression defined severe depression. RESULTS: Clinically depressed patients had a higher odds ratio (OR) of CA (1.88; 95 \% confidence interval [CI], 1.59-2.23), which persisted after adjustment for confounders (OR, 1.43; 95 \% CI, 1.18-1.73). The association was observed in both sexes, in various age groups, and in subjects with prior physician-diagnosed heart disease (OR, 1.27; 95 \% CI, 1.01-1.60) and without prior physician-diagnosed heart disease (OR, 1.71; 95 \% CI, 1.22-2.41) (P = .13 for the interaction). Compared with nondepressed subjects, the risk of CA was increased in less severely depressed subjects (OR, 1.30; 95 \% CI, 1.04-1.63) and further increased in severely depressed subjects (OR, 1.77; 95 \% CI, 1.28-2.45) (P \textless .001 for trend).

1433,Depression and cancer survivorship: importance of coping self-efficacy in post-treatment survivors.,"Philip, Errol J.; Merluzzi, Thomas V.; Zhang, Zhiyong; Heitzmann, Carolyn A.","BACKGROUND: An estimated 30 \% of cancer patients are expected to experience clinically significant psychological distress during the treatment phase of their disease. Despite significant attention being directed to the mental health needs of individuals undergoing and completing treatment, there is less known about the mental health needs of survivors and the role of potential protective factors in survivorship, such as coping self-efficacy and social support. METHOD: One hundred and twenty-four post-treatment cancer survivors (mean age = 62.23 years, women = 70 \% , average 9.3 years post-treatment) were asked to complete measures of physical symptoms, coping self-efficacy, social support, and depression as part of a national convenience sample of cancer patients and survivors. RESULTS: About 20 \% of participants possessed scores on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depressed Mood Scale indicative of clinically relevant depression. Coping self-efficacy was not only a significant predictor of depression (43 \% Variance Accounted For); it also partially mediated the relationship between symptoms and depression. Social support accounted for limited variance and was not a significant predictor of depression in a model containing both social support and coping self-efficacy as predictors. CONCLUSION: A substantial minority of post-treatment survivors reported depression symptomatology. Coping self-efficacy may be an important component of patients' adjustment and possible target for intervention. These results highlight the ongoing mental health and support needs of cancer survivors.",2013.0,10.1002/pon.3088,HTKE22KC,0,behavior,1434

M.; Stilp, E.; Walker, C. N.; Mena-Hurtado, C.","Erectile dysfunction (ED) is estimated to affect 150 million people worldwide and may indicate diffuse systemic macrovascular disease. Endothelial dysfunction represents the probable pathophysiological link between vasculogenic ED, coronary artery disease (CAD), and peripheral artery disease (PAD), and the artery size hypothesis along with evidence-based research support ED as the incident clinical event. Given that many common risk factors for atherosclerosis, including smoking, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and obesity are prevalent and causative in patients with ED, it is likely that metabolic factors play a crucial role in the link between the two disorders. The interplay of these factors provides a unifying physiological, endocrinological, and behavioral model for the association between ED, CAD, and PAD. Current therapy is unlikely to reverse the natural history of ED. Percutaneous revascularization may improve ED symptoms, and thereby quality of life, in a select group of patients. Large prospective studies are needed to define male pelvic arterial anatomy and thus enhance the utilization of internal pudendal angiography and revascularization. In this review, we provide an overview of normal erectile anatomy and physiology, the pathophysiology of ED, currently accepted diagnostic imaging modalities and treatments for ED, and recently investigated endovascular therapies for ED.",2013.0,,ISYJAUBN,0,behavior,1435

A 12-session cognitively orientated group programme covering a range of areas was attended by 18 carers over a 6-month period. Following the group, a significant decrease was found in the carer's negative appraisals of the impact of psychosis, feelings of burden, depression and anxiety rates as measured by the Experience of Caregiving Inventory (ECI), Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). A significant positive correlation was also found between carer's negative appraisals and their anxiety and depression rates, although further research is needed to clarify the causality of this relationship.",2010.0,10.1111/j.1365-2850.2010.01564.x,8756XAY7,0,cognitive,1436

However, the relationship between residents' psychological characteristics and their assessments of faculty physicians is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether residents' well-being and empathy influenced their assessments of faculty physicians. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We studied 1,191 assessments of 356 faculty physicians by 209 internal medicine residents at a large academic medical center from 2007 to 2008. A repeated measures design with multivariate generalized estimating equations was used to evaluate associations between resident well-being and empathy, and residents' assessments of faculty. MEASUREMENTS: Resident surveys included standardized measures of quality of life, burnout, depression, and empathy. Residents assessed faculty members' teaching performance with a validated 16-item instrument. RESULTS: 149 residents (71 \% ) provided well-being, empathy, and assessment data. In multivariate models, faculty assessments from the previous year were the strongest predictor of current resident-of-faculty assessment scores. Residents' Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE) scores were also associated with faculty assessments (beta = 0.0063, 95 \% CI = 0.0018-0.0108; p = .0061). On this 140-point, 20-item scale, a 10-point increase in empathy correlated with a 0.063-point increase in residents' assessments of faculty on a 5-point scale. There were no significant associations between residents' assessments of faculty and quality of life, burnout, or depression. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that residents' well-being does not influence their assessments of faculty physicians, thus supporting the trustworthiness of these assessments as a criterion for promoting clinician-educators. However, the association between residents' empathy and resident-of-faculty assessments suggests that faculty assessments may be modestly influenced by residents' intrinsic characteristics.",2010.0,10.1007/s11606-009-1152-0,RHNEUJNL,0,cognitive,1440
1440,Some subtypes of depression and their implications for psychoanalytic treatment,"Bleichmar, H. B.","The author argues the case for the need to develop an integrative clinical psychoanalytic model of depression which takes into account various pathways leading to different subtypes of depression. Some factors intervening in the genesis and maintenance of depression (aggression, guilt, narcissistic disorders, persecutory anxieties, ego deficits, masochism, identification with depressive parents and fixation to traumatic events in which the subject felt helpless) are examined, as well as certain dynamic interrelations between them. The relationship between aggression and depression is analysed, with particular attention devoted to the steps through which aggression turns into depression. The origins of guilt are reviewed, including those conditions which are independent of aggression. Psychoanalytic interventions that could be pertinent for a given subtype of depression, but which could prove counterproductive when applied to another subtype are discussed. Clinical examples are given to provide support for the ideas presented, recognising that further studies are required to establish more specific correlations between the different depressive configurations and the types of psychoanalytic interventions best suited for changing them.",1996.0,,WGCYD2LT,0,psychodynamic,1441

The aim of this study was to examine the associations of leisure-time physical activity with subsequent psychotropic medication among middle-aged people employed at baseline. Methods: Questionnaire survey data collected in 2000-02 among 40-60-year-old employees of the City of Helsinki (N. = 8960) were linked with register data on prescribed psychotropic medication (74 \% gave permission to linkage). The mean follow-up time was 4.2. years. The analysis included 5961 respondents (78 \% women). The participants were classified into four groups according to physical activity recommendations. Cox regression analysis was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) for the first psychotropic medication purchase. Results: Leisure-time physical activity was associated with decreased risk of any psychotropic medication. After adjusting for prior psychotropic medication conditioning exercisers (HR. = 0.65, 95 \% CI, 0.53-0.80), the vigorously active (HR. = 0.83, 95 \% CI, 0.71-0.98) and the moderately active (HR. = 0.85, 95 \% CI, 0.74-0.97) all showed a reduced risk of medication compared with the inactive. The associations were similar for the two main groups of psychotropic medication: antidepressants as well as sedatives and sleep medication. Conclusions: Leisure-time physical activity is potentially important for preventing mental health problems among the middle-aged. \textcopyright 2013 Elsevier Inc.",2013.0,,KAPDNY7J,0,behavior,1442

DESIGN: Population-based, prospective cohort study. SETTING: The Fujiwara-Kyo Study, Nara, Japan. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling individuals aged 65 and older with a perfect baseline and valid follow-up instrumental activity of daily living (IADL) (n = 3,267), intellectual activity (IA) (n = 2,925), and social role (SR) (n = 2,698) scores. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported HL was evaluated using a single question: Do you feel you have hearing loss? IADLs, IA, and SR were measured using the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology Index of Competence (TMIG-IC) subscales. Geriatric syndromes (depressive symptoms, cognitive impairment, sleep disturbance, falls, urinary incontinence, visual impairment) were self-reported at baseline. Blood tests were performed to measure cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS: During 5-year follow-up, new declines developed for 213 participants in IADLs, 272 in IA, and 327 in SR. After adjustment for all covariates, including geriatric syndromes, using multiple logistic regression analysis, self-reported HL at baseline was associated with a decline in IA (odds ratio (OR) = 1.39, 95 \% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.86) and SR (OR = 1.34, 95 \% CI = 1.02-1.76) but not IADLs (OR = 1.07, 95 \% CI = 0.76-1.48).

Nevertheless, it is unclear whether shame serves as a mediator between such early memories and depressive symptoms. This study aimed at testing whether the impact of shame traumatic memory, centrality of shame memory, early memories of warmth and safeness (predictors), on depressive symptoms (outcome) would be mediated by current external and internal shame. Student participants (N = 178) recalled an early shame experience and completed self-report instruments measuring centrality and traumatic characteristics of the shame memory, early memories of warmth and safeness, external and internal shame and depressive symptoms. Path analysis' results revealed that internal shame fully mediated the relationship between shame traumatic memory, centrality of shame memory, and early memories of warmth and safeness, and depression. However, current feelings of external shame, highly linked to internal shame, did not significantly predict depression. These findings shed light on the role of internalizing early shame and lack of safeness memories into a sense of self as globally self-condemning in the vulnerability to experience depressive symptoms.",2013.0,,RL92AMUC,0,psychodynamic,1445

We describe longer-term symptomatic and functional outcome following multimodal intensive inpatient treatment for TRD. METHODS: Symptomatic and functional outcomes were assessed in 71 participants (unipolar, n=51; bipolar, n=20) with severe TRD previously treated at a specialist inpatient unit a median of 34 months (IQR 19-52) post discharge. We looked at outcomes in defined subgroups (unipolar, bipolar and psychotic) and at symptom clusters to see whether certain aspects of depression were more resistant to treatment than others. RESULTS: Symptomatic improvement during the admission was maintained at follow up: HDRS21 scores fell from admission (median 22; IQR 19-25) to discharge (median 12; IQR 7-16) and follow-up (median 10; IQR 4-18). Overall, two-thirds of patients were judged to have a good long-term outcome, while half remained in full remission at follow-up. Outcomes were more favourable in bipolar patients, patients without a history of psychosis and patients who were discharged in remission, although a minority of responders at discharge no longer met response criteria at follow up, and conversely some patients discharged as non-responders did subsequently respond. Non-remitting depression was characterised by three main factors; anxiety, cognitive difficulties and sleep disturbance. Those who remitted had better functional outcomes as did those who had experienced a more sustained response to treatment whilst inpatients. Quality of life was poor for those who did not respond to the treatment package. LIMITATIONS: Variable follow-up length. CONCLUSIONS: This difficult-to-treat population gained long-term benefits from multidisciplinary inpatient treatment. Treatment to remission was associated with more favourable outcomes. Non-responsive depression was characterised by specific symptom clusters that might be amenable to more targeted treatments.",2014.0,10.1016/j.jad.2014.05.013,5CWCXA2J,0,cognitive,1446

In the present study, we investigated the effects of catecholamine stimulation on MMP-7 expression in gastric cancer cells and elucidated the molecular mechanisms of the up-regulation of MMP-7 level by catecholamine through an adrenergic signaling pathway.Results: Increased MMP-7 expression was identified at both mRNA and protein levels in the gastric cancer cells in response to isoproterenol stimulation. $\beta$2-AR antigonist effectively abrogated isoproterenol-induced MMP-7 expression. The activation of STAT3 and AP-1 was prominently induced by isoproterenol stimulation and AP-1 displayed a greater efficacy than STAT3 in isoproterenol-induced MMP-7 expression. Mutagenesis of three STAT3 binding sites in MMP-7 promoter failed to repress the transactivation of MMP-7 promoter and silencing STAT3 expression was not effective in preventing isoproterenol-induced MMP-7 expression. However, isoproterenol-induced MMP-7 promoter activities were completely disappeared when the AP-1 site was mutated. STAT3 and c-Jun could physically interact and bind to the AP-1 site, implicating that the interplay of both transcriptional factors on the AP-1 site is responsible for isoproterenol-stimulated MMP-7 expression in gastric cancer cells. The expression of MMP-7 in gastric cancer tissues was found to be at the site where $\beta$2-AR was overexpressed and the levels of MMP-7 and $\beta$2-AR were the highest in the metastatic locus of gastric cancer.Conclusions: Up-regulation of MMP-7 expression through $\beta$2-AR-mediated signaling pathway is involved in invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer. \textcopyright 2010 Shi et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2010.0,10.1186/1476-4598-9-269,V267PGVT,0,diathesis,1447

Methods: To study the impact of the therapeutic alliance patients in psychotherapy answered to the CALPAS-P at the first and third session and to the Self-report Questionnaire (SRQ-20), to the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and to the Hamilton Anxiety Scale at the beginning and at the end of psychotherapy. Results: The study of the impact of the therapeutic alliance in brief psychodynamic psychotherapy showed that higher TUI scores in the first session were significantly associated to the improvement on the BDI. Patients with best scores in the working alliance, measured at the third PWC session had also significant symptomatic changes. Discussion: The study of the impact of the therapeutic alliance in brief psychotherapy indicated that patients who perceived that their therapists had the best capability to understand and to be involved in their issues had best results in reducing depressive symptoms and patients with higher capability to form the working alliance reached the best psychotherapy outcomes.",2003.0,,M3EXDVRY,0,psychodynamic,1449
1449,Ethics of psychosurgery.,"Bouckoms, A. J.","The ethics of psychosurgery involve questions of moral philosophy and pragmatism in alleviating human suffering. The weighing of scientific data along with philosophical oughts and shoulds is required. The medical literature indicates definite efficacy for some kinds of limbic surgery, mainly cingulotomy and capsulotomy, in some kinds of conditions, namely major depression, pain and anxiety. The relative utility of these procedures given the severity of the illnesses and the safety of the procedures described is significant. Ethical and moral conflicts over altruism, autonomy and suffering require recognition before their due considerations (Kleinig 1985). The following recommendations emerge from these considerations: 1. No consideration of ethics in psychosurgery is complete without consideration of both the scientific data and moral conflicts. 2. The considerable efficacy and safety of cingulotomy and capsulotomy must be acknowledged. 3. Indications and contraindications do exist for selecting patients. Major psychiatric Axis I diagnoses of depression and anxiety are the indications. Personality disorders are not indications. 4. Peer review, unfettered consent and knowledge of the psychodynamics of severe illness are three ingredients necessary for wise decisions about performing limbic surgery. 5. The liberal advocation of autonomy without responsibility is an amoral, not liberating, point of view. 6. Politics should be denounced as the most serious ethical problem in medical decision making. Political intrusion into the scientific matters and the doctor-patient relationship has created ethical problems with psychosurgery and continues to do so today.",1988.0,,823F7KUN,0,psychodynamic,1450

Issues of survivor guilt toward her murdered sister, identification with her anxious, unhappy mother, and compliance with her critical and rejecting father were addressed and at least partially worked through in the first 11 sessions of treatment. The S's depression has lifted, she has been able to write freely, and she has stopped obsessing about her ex-boyfriend. The therapist was able to combine cognitive mastery theory and EMDR to create a rapid but deep exploration and amelioration of the client's major, longstanding life problems.

The author examines how these negative affects, the accompanying victim role, and oppositional defiance enable angry adolescents to defend against depression and loss, to demand nurturance from others, to protect their precarious inner autonomy, and to undo their humiliation and shame by vengeance and reversal. The author suggests that adolescent anger arises from an underlying wish to coerce objects into providing all-giving restitution for losses and narcissistic injuries, not necessarily from a wish to sadistically or enviously destroy them.",1990.0,,2QGRBUNW,0,psychodynamic,1454
1454,Interpersonal psychoanalysis' radical facade.,"Hirsch, Irwin","The participant-observation model initiated the relational turn, as well as the shift from modernism to postmodernism in psychoanalysis. This two-person, coparticipant conceptualization of the psychoanalytic situation moved psychoanalysis from the realm of alleged objective science toward intersubjectivity and hermeneutics. From this perspective, the analyst as subjective other is constantly engaged affectively with the patient in ways that are very often out of awareness. Analyst and patient both, for better or for worse, are believed to unwittingly influence one another. This description of the analytic dyad has led many to mistakingly conclude that interpersonal psychoanalysts advocate wittinly affective expressiveness, often in the form of deliberate self-disclosure of feelings, as part of a standard analytic stance. Upon closer examination, radical interventions are no more emblematic of interpersonal analysts than they are of analysts from most other traditions, though the interpersonalists have indeed expanded what had theretofore been a rather narrow repertoire of interventions.",2002.0,,BKBZWG59,0,psychodynamic,1455

J.; Parsey, R.; Weissman, M.; Fava, M.","BACKGROUND: One in three clinical trial patients with major depressive disorder report symptomatic improvement with placebo. Strategies to mitigate the effect of placebo responses have focused on modifying study design with variable success. Identifying and excluding or controlling for individuals with a high likelihood of responding to placebo may improve clinical trial efficiency and avoid unnecessary medication trials. METHODS: Participants included those assigned to the placebo arm (n = 141) of the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures for Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) trial. The elastic net was used to evaluate 283 baseline clinical, behavioral, imaging, and electrophysiological variables to identify the most robust yet parsimonious features that predicted depression severity at the end of the double-blind 8-week trial. Variables retained in at least 50% of the 100 imputed data sets were used in a Bayesian multiple linear regression model to simultaneously predict the probabilities of response and remission. RESULTS: Lower baseline depression severity, younger age, absence of melancholic features or history of physical abuse, less anxious arousal, less anhedonia, less neuroticism, and higher average theta current density in the rostral anterior cingulate predicted a higher likelihood of improvement with placebo. The Bayesian model predicted remission and response with an actionable degree of accuracy (both AUC > 0.73). An interactive calculator was developed predicting the likelihood of placebo response at the individual level. CONCLUSION: Easy-to-measure clinical, behavioral, and electrophysiological assessments can be used to identify placebo responders with a high degree of accuracy. Development of this calculator based on these findings can be used to identify potential placebo responders.",2018.0,10.1159/000491093,KBMTMN2U,0,additional,1456

Oude; Comijs, Hannie C.; Stek, M. L.","Background: Depression and cognitive decline are highly prevalent in older persons and both are associated with low serum brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Mutual pathways of depression and cognitive decline in older persons may explain the overlap in symptoms and low serum BDNF. We hypothesized that serum BDNF levels are lower in depressed elderly with poor cognitive performance (global or specifically in working memory, speed of information processing, and episodic memory) compared to depressed elderly without cognitive impairment or non-depressed controls. Methods: BDNF Serum levels and cognitive functioning were examined in 378 depressed persons and 132 non-depressed controls from a large prospective study on late-life depression. The association between BDNF levels and each cognitive domain among the depressed patients was tested by four separate linear regression models adjusted for relevant covariates. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to compare BDNF serum levels in three groups (depression with cognitive impairment, depression without cognitive impairment, and non-depressed controls), when adjusted for potential confounders. Results: No significant linear association was found between BDNF and any of the four cognitive domains tested. There are no differences in BDNF levels between controls and depressed patients with or without cognitive impairment global or in specific domains after controlling for confounders. Conclusions: BDNF serum levels in this cohort of older depressed patients and controls are not related to cognitive functioning. As BDNF is essential for the survival and functioning of neurons, its levels may remain normal in stages of disease where remission is achievable.

1457,Family connections: A program for adolescents and parents,"Payne, L.","Objectives: Research suggests that a lack of understanding/information on borderline personality disorder (BPD), parents' own emotion about their children's difficulties, and a lack of parent and relationship skills for dealing with their troubled teenagers may contribute to poorer outcomes for both teenagers with BPD-related problems and their parents. Family Connections (FC) is a free 12-week program designed to address three areas of potential deficits: 1) education on BPD, emotion dysregulation, and family interactions; 2) individual skills to help parents cope; and 3) relationship and parent skills to help parents interact with their teenagers in healthier ways. FC (a group program) also provides parents peer support. Prior studies show reductions in burden, depression, and grief and an increase in empowerment with sample groups consisting of parents of teenagers, parents of adults, partners, and siblings. Data from the present study evaluate FC impact on suicidal and self-harming teenagers in a residential treatment program. Methods: Adolescents were randomly assigned to participate in FC or a waitlist control. Adolescents and parents completed an assessment packet within two weeks of admission, one month after FC was completed, or at the end of the waiting period. Adolescents also completed an assessment packet one week before discharge. Assessment for parents included measures of burden, depression, grief, mastery, and empowerment. Adolescents completed measures of depression, emotion regulation, effective coping skills, and parental validation and invalidation. Results: Results from 102 adolescents and their parents indicate findings similar to those of the original FC program in reducing burden and distress. Additionally, adolescent patients reported significantly increased validating responses from their parents and significantly decreased invalidating responses. Data presented will include potential moderator variables and the potentially mediating role of parent participation on teenage outcomes. Conclusions: The present study is the first study to examine the effectiveness of FC in a sample group of only adolescents and their parents. Furthermore, the present study is the first to investigate the effect of parental participation in FC on treatment outcomes for adolescents.

S.; Sharma, A.","Objectives: Although antidepressant medications are effective, they have a delayed onset of effect. Mirtazapine, an atypical antidepressant is an important option for add-on therapy in major depression. There is insufficient data on mirtazapine in Indian population; hence this study was designed to study the add-on effect of low-dose mirtazapine with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in major depressive disorder (MDD) in Indian population. Materials and Methods: In an open, randomized study, 60 patients were divided into two groups. In Group A (n=30) patients received conventional SSRIs for 6 weeks. In Group B (n=30) patients received conventional SSRIs with low-dose mirtazapine for 6 weeks. Patients were evaluated at baseline and then at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 weeks. Results: There was significant improvement in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Montgomery and Asberg depression rating scale (MADRS) scores (P \textless 0.05) in both groups. Mirtazapine in low dose as add on therapy showed improvement in scores, had earlier onset of action, and more number of responders and remitters as compared to conventional treatment (P \textless 0.05).

Conclusion: Low-dose mirtazapine as add-on therapy has shown better efficacy, earlier onset of action and more number of responders and remitters as compared to conventional treatment in MDD in Indian patients.",2012.0,10.4103/0253-7613.93843,6DRBWLY6,0,diathesis,1459
1459,Treating late-life depression: Comparing the effects of internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy across the adult lifespan,"Hobbs, M. J.; Joubert, A. E.; Mahoney, A. E. J.; Andrews, G.","BACKGROUND: The burden attributable to late-life depression is set to increase with the ageing population. The size of the workforce trained to deliver psychogeriatric medicine is limited. Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) is an efficacious and scalable treatment option for depression. Yet older adults are underrepresented in iCBT research. This study examines the effects of iCBT for depression across the adult lifespan among patients seeking help in routine clinical care (N = 1288). METHODS: Regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between age group (e.g., 18-24years (n = 141); 25-34years (n = 289); 35-44years (n = 320); 45-54years (n = 289); 55-64years (n = 180); 65 +years (n = 69)) and presenting demographic and clinical characteristics, adherence to treatment, and rates of remission, recovery and reliable improvement. Linear mixed models were used to examine whether reductions in symptom severity, distress and impairment varied as a function of age. RESULTS: Patients aged 65+ years were more likely to be male compared to those aged 18-34 years and have been prescribed iCBT by their GP compared to those aged 55-64 years. Patients experiencing late-life depression experienced moderate to large effect size reductions in depressive symptom severity, psychological distress, and impairment, as did all other age groups. Rates of remission, recovery or reliable improvement were comparable across the adult lifespan. CONCLUSIONS: iCBT is an effective treatment option for depression including in later life, and can be used to scale evidenced-based medicine in routine clinical care. LIMITATIONS: No follow-up data were collected.

This analysis evaluates the effectiveness of the Improving Mood-Promoting Access to Collaborative Treatment (IMPACT) program, a stepped care management program for depression in primary care patients who had an ICD-9 cancer diagnosis. METHODS: Two hundred fifteen cancer patients were identified from the 1,801 participants in the parent study. Subjects were 60 years or older with major depression (18 \% ), dysthymic disorder (33 \% ), or both (49 \% ), recruited from 18 primary care clinics belonging to 8 health-care organizations in 5 states. Patients were randomly assigned to the IMPACT intervention (n = 112) or usual care (n = 103). Intervention patients had access for up to 12 months to a depression care manager who was supervised by a psychiatrist and a primary care provider and who offered education, care management, support of antidepressant management, and brief, structured psychosocial interventions including behavioral activation and problem-solving treatment. RESULTS: At 6 and 12 months, 55 \% and 39 \% of intervention patients had a 50 \% or greater reduction in depressive symptoms (SCL-20) from baseline compared to 34 \% and 20 \% of usual care participants (P = 0.003 and P = 0.029). Intervention patients also experienced greater remission rates (P = 0.031), more depression-free days (P \textless 0.001), less functional impairment (P = 0.011), and greater quality of life (P = 0.039) at 12 months than usual care participants.

1462,Relationship of sexual dysfunction with trauma,"Erdem, M.","Exposure to sexual trauma in adulthood is perceived as helplessness and loss of control even if sexuality has been defined as a pleasant event before trauma. Feelings of guilt and shame occurring after trauma as well as secondary clinical pictures such as depression, post traumatic stress disorder, and alcoholism are major causes of sexual dysfunction. Also sexual abuse in childhood raises a sense of weakness and perception of inadequacy. These individuals are at risk of developing inappropriate sexual behaviors over time. Indulging in sexual behaviors and thoughts that are evaluate sexuality as a gift or privilege are precursors for these inappropriate behaviors. In addition, the stigmatization caused by feelings of shame and guilt in these children is another cause of sexual problems in the future. Childhood sexual trauma is associated with negative attitudes about sexuality, lack of sexual satisfaction, orgasmic failure, need for sexual therapy and low self-esteem about sexual attractiveness. Chronic pelvic pain is a significant clinical entity which causes sexual dysfunction in many ways. In studies, the rate of traumatic childhood sexual experiences was found to be over 60 \% in these patients (N. Leithner, 2006). The difference between patients with chronic pelvic pain and a healthy control group was found to be even greater in terms of the increasing violence of sexual trauma. In a study of 63 patients with chronic pelvic pain, a history of sexual trauma was identified in 64.5 \% of cases and deficiencies in sexual function were found to be associated with the level of depression in these patients (ME Randolph, 2006). There are several studies that show that physical and sexual trauma plays a role in the etiology of vaginismus. In a study comparing the childhood and adolescent sexual traumas of patients with vaginismus and dyspareunia and control groups -(each group consisting of 29 patients) childhood sexual trauma was found to be twice as high as the control group in the vaginismus group (Reissing ED, 2003). In the literature there are case reports suggesting that EMDR is effective in cases of vaginismus resulting from childhood sexual trauma. In studies evaluating the relationship between childhood sexual traumas and a specific sexual dysfunction, aand in studies examining sexual functioning in general, a strong relationship has been found between these two situations. Structural vulnerability and the severity of sexual trauma were also reported to affect this relationship. While childhood sexual trauma is associated with sexual stimulation disorder, orgasmic disorder, vaginismus, dyspareunia and emotional problems about sexuality (sexual guilt, sexual anxiety etc.) in most individuals, high-risk sexual behaviors, characterized by extreme preoccupation with sexuality and uncontrolled sexual relationships, are seen in fewer individuals. Sexual childhood trauma in men is being reported, recognized and treated less frequently than the actual prevalence. Sexual dysfunction in these individuals was reported to be seen at least five times more than people who have not been exposed to a trauma. In a study of 1793 individuals, exposure to sexual trauma before age 16 has been reported at more than 1/3 of women and about 1/6 of men. In both sexes, especially in women, an association between the presence of childhood sexual trauma and sexual dysfunction has been identified (Najma JM, 2005). Leonard et al. found that problems associated with orgasm are the most frequent sexual problems seen in individuals who were exposed to a childhood sexual trauma (2008).",2011.0,,B7VRG5V2,0,psychodynamic,1463

P.","Background: Fifteen patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy and inducible ischaemia were studied to determine the mechanisms of mortality. Failure of the contractile reserve during daily life activities may reflect a prognostic index. Methods: Single photon emission cardiac tomography and radionuclide ambulatory monitoring (Vest) data were analysed in all patients with a 7-year follow-up. Results: At peak exercise on Vest, the 7 non-survivors (N-SURV) showed worse peak ejection rates (PERs) and ejection fractions (EFs) compared with the 8 survivors (SURV), (2 ± 0.6 vs. 3.3 ± 0.7; end-diastolic volumes (EDVs), P \textless 0.003), and (34 ± 10 \% vs. 50 ± 13 \% ; P \textless 0.02), respectively. However, exercise peak filling rates (PFRs) (1.9 ± 0.6 vs. 2.7 ± 0.9; EDVs/s) and exercise heart rates (HRs), (97 ± 17 vs. 106 ± 10), did not differ between the two groups (P \textgreater 0.05). In SURV, exercise PERs, which represented rapid left ventricular (LV) emptying, were significantly correlated with exercise PFRs, representing rapid LV filling, (r = 0.71, P \textless 0.04) but not in N-SURV (r = 0.66, P \textgreater 0.05). Among SURV, the Frank-Starling mechanism was thus preserved but not in N-SURV. Upon Cox analysis, overall LV function parameters, exercise PER was the only predictive measure associated with mortality (b = - 0.018, relative hazard ratio = 0.98, P = 0.02). Conclusions: Exercise PER reduced values reflected failure of the Frank-Starling mechanism, the incapacity of the heart to perform rapid contractile adaptations to daily life activities and a poor prognosis. \textcopyright The authors, Journal compilation \textcopyright Cardiol Res and Elmer PressTM.",2012.0,10.4021/cr203w,3PE4PS83,0,cognitive_additional,1466

Coping is a mediator between stressful life events and adverse outcomes, and coping skills have been incorporated into interventions (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, safety-planning interventions) for suicidal populations. However, longitudinal research has not directly examined the prospective associations between multiple coping styles and suicide-related outcomes in high-risk samples. This study identified cross-sectional and 4-month longitudinal associations of coping styles with suicide risk factors (i.e., depression, suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior) in a sample of 286 adolescent and young adult psychiatric emergency patients. Positive reframing was the coping style most consistently associated with positive outcomes, whereas self-blame and disengagement were consistently associated with negative outcomes. Active coping protected against suicidal behavior for males, but not for females. This was the first study to examine longitudinal relationships between coping and suicide-related outcomes in a high-risk clinical sample. Findings suggest that clinical interventions with suicidal adolescents and young adults may benefit from a specific focus on increasing positive reframing and reducing self-blame.",2018.0,10.1016/j.beth.2017.07.010,BYNLMVH7,0,additional,1469

R.; Fortnum, H.; Edmondson-Jones, M.; McCormack, A.; Munro, K. J.","Hearing loss is associated with poor cognitive performance and incident dementia and may contribute to cognitive decline. Treating hearing loss with hearing aids may ameliorate cognitive decline. The purpose of this study was to test whether use of hearing aids was associated with better cognitive performance and if this relationship was mediated via social isolation and/or depression. Structural equation modelling of associations between hearing loss, cognitive performance, social isolation, depression and hearing aid use was carried out with a subsample of the UK Biobank data set (n = 164,770) of UK adults aged 40 to 69 years who completed a hearing test. Age, sex, general health and socioeconomic status were controlled for as potential confounders. Hearing aid use was associated with better cognition, independently of social isolation and depression. This finding was consistent with the hypothesis that hearing aids may improve cognitive performance, although if hearing aids do have a positive effect on cognition it is not likely to be via reduction of the adverse effects of hearing loss on social isolation or depression. We suggest that any positive effects of hearing aid use on cognition may be via improvement in audibility or associated increases in self-efficacy. Alternatively, positive associations between hearing aid use and cognition may be accounted for by more cognitively able people seeking and using hearing aids. Further research is required to determine the direction of association, if there is any direct causal relationship between hearing aid use and better cognition, and whether hearing aid use results in reduction in rates of cognitive decline measured longitudinally.",2015.0,,JXYAPZIG,0,behavior,1470

Within and between Task positive Network (TPN) and Default Mode Network (DMN) connectivity were assessed and related to variability of performance on the N-Back task and rumination scores. Results: Over the entire working memory task, the functional connectivity found in the EB group within DMN (cc=0.47), CEN (cc=0.42) was significantly different than the NEB group (DMN, cc=0.54; CEN, cc=0.50). Moreover the negative correlation between DMN and TPN was significantly lower in the EB than NEB group. This anti-correlation between DMN and TPN was differently related to variability of reaction time on N-Back task and rumination. The greater the anticorrelation in DMN-TPN the lower the rumination score (r =0.71) in EB patients. Conclusions: Clinical remission in depression is associated with biological heterogeneity. Emotional blunting may compromise cognitive functioning of remitted depressed patients by impacting on cooperation between DMN and TPN and dampening cognitive resources for monitoring rumination.",2016.0,,HAS9HTBK,0,cognitive,1471

F.; Reinwald, J. R.; Oettl, L. L.; Meyer-Lindenberg, A.; Vollmayr, B.; Kelsch, W.; Sartorius, A.","Hyperconnectivity of the default-mode network (DMN) is one of the most widely replicated neuroimaging findings in major depressive disorder (MDD). Further, there is growing evidence for a central role of the lateral habenula (LHb) in the pathophysiology of MDD. There is preliminary neuroimaging evidence linking LHb and the DMN, but no causal relationship has been shown to date. We combined optogenetics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to establish a causal relationship, using an animal model of treatment-resistant depression, namely Negative Cognitive State rats. First, an inhibitory light-sensitive ion channel was introduced into the LHb by viral transduction. Subsequently, laser stimulation was performed during fMRI acquisition on a 9.4 Tesla animal scanner. Neural activity and connectivity were assessed, before, during and after laser stimulation. We observed a connectivity decrease in the DMN following laser-induced LHb perturbation. Our data indicate a causal link between LHb downregulation and reduction in DMN connectivity. These findings may advance our mechanistic understanding of LHb inhibition, which had previously been identified as a promising therapeutic principle, especially for treatment-resistant depression.",2018.0,10.1038/s41398-018-0121-y,IJ8EYT2A,0,additional,1472
1472,"Countertransference reactions with physical child abuse: The influence of tolerance of ambiguity, experience and expression of anger, and childhood history of parental physical abuse among female therapists.","Waring, Stacey Lee","The present study examined countertransference reactions among 84 female therapists as a function of the therapist's tolerance of ambiguity, experience of angry feelings, anger suppression and expression, and a childhood history of parental physical abuse. The study utilized a multivariate approach to the measurement of the dependent variable of countertransference reactions by evaluating behavioral, affective, and cognitive components of countertransference. Behavioral reactions were computed after measurement of the percentage of avoidance responses, as seen by the therapist's withdrawal from the client, to an abused child in a videotape therapy simulation. Affective reactions were measured with a state anxiety inventory, and cognitive reactions were measured by the distortion in recall of abuse-related words after the viewing of the videotape. It was hypothesized that female therapists who were less tolerant of ambiguity, more likely to experience intense angry feelings, more likely to suppress those feelings, and/or who had a childhood history of parental physical abuse, would have greater countertransference reactions to a physically abused child. Using analysis of variance, and multiple regression where appropriate, female therapists who were found to have intense angry feelings and a tendency to suppress those feelings were also found to have significantly greater countertransference reactions. Additionally, female therapists who aggressively expressed their anger also demonstrated significantly higher countertransference reactions. Female therapists with a low tolerance of ambiguity, high experience of intense angry feelings, and a history of childhood abuse were found to be positively correlated with countertransference reactions. The childhood history of physical abuse was not, by itself, a predictor of countertransference; it was found that a high percentage of therapists who reported abuse did not see their parental discipline as abusive and, thus, may have minimized the abusive treatment of the child in the videotape. Limitations of the study and recommendations for future studies of countertransference with children are discussed.

1473,The relationship between sleep and work: A meta-analysis,"Litwiller, B.; Snyder, L. A.; Taylor, W. D.; Steele, L. M.","Sleep has tremendous importance to organizations because of its relationship with employee performance, safety, health, and attitudes. Moreover, sleep is a malleable behavior that may be improved by individual and organizational changes. Despite the consequential and modifiable nature of sleep, little consensus exists regarding its conceptualization, and how the choice of conceptualization may impact relationships with organizational antecedents and outcomes. To offer a stronger foundation for future theory and research about employee sleep, this study calculated meta-analytic correlations of sleep quality and sleep quantity from 152 primary studies of sleep among workers in organizations. Analyses revealed that both sleep quality and sleep quantity associated negatively with workload and a number of health, attitudinal, and affective outcomes. Despite their conceptual similarity, notable differences existed in sleep quality and sleep quantity in terms of their relationships to many different correlates. Generally, the relationships between sleep quality and the examined correlates were stronger for variables that reflected perceptions. Moderator analyses showed that relationships between sleep quality and quantity may be affected by measurement method and the number of self-report items used, while there is little evidence of the effect of measurement time frame. Findings from this first meta-analytic investigation of the occupational sleep literature have implications for the development of theory about relationships between sleep and work, the measurement of sleep, the identification of organizational correlates of sleep, and the design of interventions intended to improve employee sleep.

In addition, concealment of facial anomalies in an effort to mask handicaps is common, and these patients also often have difficulties with interpersonal relationships and in social situations. Despite this, no previous study has investigated the association between concealment of facial anomalies and depression, and a patient's quality of life. METHODS: A group of 65 patients, who had been scheduled for plastic surgery, completed this study. A total of 50 patients who had congenital facial anomalies, some of whom concealed their facial anomalies (N=22), and some whom didn't (N=28), as well as 15 patient controls were interviewed and subsequently administered the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), the Millon Behavioral Medicine Diagnostic (MBMD) and the WHO Quality of Life (WHOQOL). RESULTS: Among patients with congenital facial anomalies, those who concealed their anomalies exhibited a significantly higher level of depression and anxiety; higher rates of self-accusation, dissatisfaction, hypochondria, weight loss and antisocial personality traits; and a lower quality of life than those who did not conceal their anomalies. To the contrary, no significant differences were found with respect to depression, anxiety and quality of life between the congenital facial anomaly group and controls. Further, the concealment of facial anomalies was a significant predictor for lifetime major depressive disorder (odds ratio (OR)=7.1, 95 \ \% \ confidence interval (CI) 1.4-37.3), after adjusting for age, gender and microtia. CONCLUSION: Facial concealment is a significant predictor of depression and poor quality of life in patients with congenital facial anomalies.",2010.0,10.1016/j.bjps.2010.01.034,PAKUQBAG,0,personality,1475

An indepth, prospective, mixed-methods, multiple case-study design was employed. Parent participants and SSTP practitioners took part. Participation in SSTP was consistently associated with improved parental self-efficacy, and was also associated with improved parental psychological well-being and decreased perceived need for behavioural services for some families. Three key themes emerged from the qualitative interview data, reflecting changes attributed to participation in SSTP: (1) changes in the attribution of cause of misbehaviour, (2) Who's the boss? reflecting a change to parents feeling more in charge of their child's behaviour, daily routines and choices, and (3) Rewarding is rewarding! reflecting appreciation of a positive approach to behaviour management. Practitioners discussed their impressions of appropriate participants, timing, structure, and session preferences for SSTP, and implications related to the professional qualifications of practitioners delivering SSTP.

However, little is known about the developmental trajectory of deficits in motivation and whether these deficits are present prior to the onset of psychosis. We assessed several components of motivation including anticipatory versus consummatory pleasure (using the Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale (TEPS)), and behavioral drive, behavioral inhibition, and reward responsivity (using the Behavioral Inhibition Scale/Behavioral Activation Scale (BIS/BAS)). A total of 234 participants completed study measures, including 60 clinical high risk (CHR) participants, 60 recent-onset schizophrenia participants (RO), 78 chronic schizophrenia participants (SZ) and 29 healthy controls (HC) age matched to the CHR group. CHR participants endorsed greater deficits in anticipatory pleasure and reward responsivity, relative to HC comparison participants and individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia. Motivational deficits were not more pronounced over the course of illness. Depressed mood was uniquely associated with impairments in motivation in the CHR sample, but not the schizophrenia participants. The results suggest that CHR individuals experience multiple contributors to impaired motivation, and thus multiple leverage points for treatment.",2014.0,10.1016/j.schres.2014.06.024,RK4LNJXI,0,personality,1477

E.","Study Objectives: Poor sleep is a risk factor for the development and recurrence of depression. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use is consistently associated with good subjective sleep in clinically depressed patient populations. However, studies in the general population are lacking. Our objective was to investigate the association between SSRIs and subjective sleep in a middle-aged and elderly population in a daily practice setting. Methods: We included participants from the prospective Rotterdam Study cohort. Participants had up to two subjective sleep measurements assessed with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ([PSQI], number of measurements = 14,770). SSRI use was based on pharmacy records. We assessed the association between SSRIs and PSQI score and its sub-components, with nonusers of any antidepressant as reference. Analyses were, among others, adjusted for presence of depressive symptoms and concurrent psycholeptic drug use. Results: We included 9,267 participants, average baseline age 66.3 y (standard deviation 10.6), and 57.6 \% women. SSRI use was significantly associated with a 0.78-point lower PSQI score (95 \% confidence interval [CI]-1.11;-0.44) which reflects better sleep, compared with non-use. The association was more prominent in continuous SSRI users (-0.71 points, 95 \% CI-1.18;-0.24). Of the sub-components, SSRIs were associated with 0.70-h longer sleep duration (95 \% CI 0.56; 0.85), higher sleep quality, higher sleep efficiency, and in contrast more daytime dysfunction. Conclusions: SSRI use was associated with better subjective sleep, after adjustment for depressive symptoms and concurrent psycholeptic drug use. This suggests that, in clinical practice in the middle-aged and elderly population, the sleep quality of some persons may benefit from, continued, SSRI use.",2016.0,10.5664/jcsm.5932,FHPJ72K9,0,cognitive_additional,1478

W.; Gould, K. R.; Spitz, G. and","Objective: To examine the influence of self-reported preinjury coping on postinjury coping, psychosocial functioning, emotional functioning, and quality of life at 1 year following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Setting: Inpatient hospital and community. Participants: One hundred seventy-four participants with TBI. Design: Prospective, longitudinal design. Participants were assessed at 5 time points: after emerging from posttraumatic amnesia, and at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months postinjury. MAIN MEASURES: Coping Scale for Adults-Short Version; Quality of Life Inventory; Sydney Psychosocial Reintegration Scale; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results: High preinjury use of nonproductive coping style predicted high use of nonproductive coping, more anxiety, and lower psychosocial functioning at 1 year postinjury. Increased use of nonproductive coping and decreased use of productive coping predicted poorer psychosocial outcome at 1 year post-TBI. Use of both productive and nonproductive coping decreased in the first 6 to 12 months post-TBI relative to preinjury. Unlike productive coping, nonproductive coping reached preinjury levels within 3 years postinjury. Conclusion: The findings support identification of individuals at risk of relying on nonproductive coping and poorer psychosocial outcome following TBI. In addition, the results emphasize the need to implement timely interventions to facilitate productive coping and reduce the use of nonproductive coping in order to maximize favorable long-term psychosocial outcome. \textcopyright 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.",2014.0,10.1097/HTR.0b013e318292fb00,HWMSHNYK,0,cognitive_additional,1479

K.","Objectives: to investigate the prevalence of depression during pregnancy and postpartum period for Jordanian women and identify associated risk factors and maternity service delivery issues. Design: a prospective cross-sectional study. Participants were recruited during the last trimester of pregnancy, provided personal, social and obstetric information, and completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Maternity Social Support Scale (MSSS), the Cambridge Worry Scale (CWS), Perceived Self-Efficacy Scale (PSES) and Perceived Knowledge Scale (PKS). All participants were contacted again at six-eight weeks and six months post partum to complete a telephone or face-to-face interview. The postnatal questionnaire included the EPDS, MSSS, and DASS-21. Setting: a teaching hospital and five health centres in Irbid city in northern Jordan. Participants: Arabic speaking women (n=353) between the ages of 18 and 45 years, in their last trimester of pregnancy, at low risk for obstetric complications and receiving antenatal care between November 2005 and August 2006. Findings: high rates of antenatal (19 \% ) and postnatal depression (22 \% ) were reported. A regression analysis revealed that stress, anxiety, financial problems, perceived lack of parenting knowledge, difficult relationship with the mother-in-law, unplanned pregnancy, and low self-efficacy were associated with antenatal depression. These seven factors accounted for 83 \% (r2=0.834) of variance in the development of probable antenatal depression. At six-eight weeks post partum, a regression analysis revealed that antenatal depression, unplanned pregnancy, difficult relationship with mother-in-law, dissatisfaction with overall care, stress, lack of social support, giving birth to a female baby, feeling pressured to birth the baby quickly, and perceived low parenting knowledge were associated with postnatal depression. These nine variables accounted for 82 \% (r2=0.819) of variance in the development of probable PND. Three intrapartum and postpartum variables associated with PND at six-eight weeks (postpartum haemorrhage, unhelpful doctors during labour and birth, and anxiety) were no longer associated with PND at six months. Conclusions and implications for practice: Jordanian women need support to prepare for labour and birth. Postpartum emotional support and assessment of symptoms of depression needs to be incorporated into routine practice. The opportunity for open discussion along with increased awareness and clarification of common misconceptions about antenatal and postnatal depression are necessary. Quality assurance systems would help reduce the rate of invasive obstetric procedures, and give greater emphasis to emotional care provided to women during the perinatal period. \textcopyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2011.0,,AHY5WTYV,0,behavior,1481

Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammatory processes play an important role in the etio-pathogenesis, phenomenology, comorbidity and treatment of MDD. Suboptimal remission rates and the persistence of cognitive deficits contribute to functional impairment in MDD inviting the need for the development of mechanistically novel and domain specific treatment approaches. The MEDLINE/ Pubmed database was searched from inception to February, 9th, 2014 with combinations of the following search terms: 'TNF-alpha', 'depression', 'infliximab', 'etanercept', 'adalimumab', 'golimumab' and 'certolizumab'. Preclinical and clinical evidence linking TNF-alpha to MDD pathophysiology were reviewed as well as the current status of TNF-alpha modulators as novel agents for the treatment of MDD. Experimental models and clinical studies provide encouraging preliminary evidence for the efficacy of TNF- alpha antagonists in mitigating depressive symptoms and improving cognitive deficits. Further studies are warranted to confirm these data in larger randomized controlled trials in primary psychiatric populations. Translational research provides a promising perspective that may aid the development and/or repurposing of mechanism-based treatments for depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment in MDD.",2015.0,,A4UMEJQW,0,cognitive,1482

F.","It is known that alterations in insulin metabolism following injury and infection result in depression of insulin levels and the development of insulin resistance. In order to further study insulin during septic and traumatic stress, we estimated insulin production in control (Group 1, n = 6), postoperative (Group 2, n = 5), and postoperative-septic (Group 3, n = 8) human subjects by measuring the 24-hour urinary C-peptide excretion. In addition, basal and peak glucose and insulin levels in response to a standard (0.5 gm/kg) intravenous glucose stimulus were measured immediately thereafter to determine if insulin levels reflected insulin production. Basal insulin for Groups 1, 2, and 3 (16 +/- 8.4, 10 +/- 3.4, 9.5 +/- 4.4 microU/ml +/- SD, respectively) were not substantially different. Peak insulin response to glucose infusion declined from Groups 1 to 3 (51 +/- 14, 42.4 +/- 31, 20.4 +/- 6.8 microU/ml, respectively) with Group 3 exhibiting a significantly decreased mean peak level compared to the other groups. Corresponding C-peptide excretion rates increased from Groups 1 to 3 (28.3 +/- 15.3, 63.7 +/- 27.6, 121.3 +/- 95.2 micrograms/day, respectively) with Group 3 exhibiting a significantly (p less than 0.05) higher level than Group 1. These data suggest that low insulin levels which may be evident in injured or septic patients not in shock reflect increased clearance and not decreased production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1987.0,,KWDMP3MN,0,cognitive_additional,1484

This randomized controlled trial evaluated the cost-effectiveness of psychodynamic-interpersonal therapy vs treatment as usual in patients with mental health problems who were unresponsive to usual treatment. METHOD: Subjects (N = 110) with nonpsychotic disorders unresponsive to 6 months of routine specialist mental health treatment were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial. Sixty-three percent were women, the mean age was 41.4 years, the median duration of illness was 5 years, 68 \% were unemployed or receiving state benefits because of illness, and 75.5 \% had a depressive illness. Intervention patients received 8 weekly sessions of psychodynamic-interpersonal psychotherapy. Control patients received usual care from their psychiatrist. Outcome measures included ratings of psychological distress and health status and a detailed economic evaluation. Analysis was conducted on an intent-to-treat basis. RESULTS: Subjects randomized to psychotherapy had a significantly greater improvement than controls in psychological distress and social functioning 6 months after the trial. Baseline treatment costs were similar for both groups. Subjects who received psychotherapy showed significant reductions in the cost of health care utilization in the 6 months after treatment compared with controls. The extra cost of psychotherapy was recouped within 6 months through reductions in health care use.

Melatonin is unlicensed in children yet widely prescribed for sleep problems. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether or not immediate-release melatonin is beneficial compared with placebo in improving total duration of night-time sleep in children with neurodevelopmental problems. DESIGN: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study. SETTING: Hospitals throughout England and Wales recruited patients referred by community paediatricians and other clinical colleagues. PARTICIPANTS: Children with neurodevelopmental problems aged from 3 years to 15 years 8 months who did not fall asleep within 1 hour of lights out or who had < 6 hours of continuous sleep. Before randomisation, patients meeting eligibility criteria entered a 4- to 6-week behaviour therapy period in which a behaviour therapy advice booklet was provided. Sleep was measured using sleep diaries and actigraphy. After this period the sleep diaries were reviewed to determine if the sleep problem fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Eligible participants were randomised and followed for 12 weeks. INTERVENTIONS: Melatonin or placebo capsules in doses of 0.5 mg, 2 mg, 6 mg and 12 mg for a period of 12 weeks. The starting dose was 0.5 mg and the dose could be escalated through 2 mg and 6 mg to 12 mg during the first 4 weeks, at the end of which the child was maintained on that dose. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was total night-time sleep time (TST) calculated using sleep diaries at 12 weeks compared with baseline. Secondary outcome measures included TST calculated using actigraphy data, sleep-onset latency (SOL) (time taken to fall asleep), sleep efficiency, Composite Sleep Disturbance Index score, global measure of child's sleep quality, Aberrant Behaviour Checklist, Family Impact Module of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, number and severity of seizures and adverse events. Salivary melatonin concentrations and association of genetic variants with abnormal melatonin production were also investigated. RESULTS: A total of 275 children were screened to enter the trial; 263 (96%) children were registered and completed the 4- to 6-week behaviour therapy period and 146 (56%) children were randomised, of whom 110 (75%) contributed data for the primary outcome. The difference in TST time between the melatonin and placebo groups adjusted for baseline was 22.43 minutes [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 44.34 minutes; p = 0.04] measured using sleep diaries. A reduction in SOL, adjusted for baseline, was seen for melatonin compared with placebo when measured by sleep diaries (-37.49 minutes, 95% CI -55.27 to -19.71 minutes; p < 0.0001) and actigraphy (-45.34 minutes, 95% CI -68.75 to -21.93 minutes; p = 0.0003). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of the reporting of adverse events. The results of other secondary outcomes favoured melatonin but were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: On average, the children treated with melatonin slept 23 minutes longer than those in the placebo group; however, the upper limit of the confidence interval was less than 1 hour, the minimum clinically worthwhile difference specified at the outset of the trial. Melatonin is effective in reducing SOL in children with neurodevelopmental delay by a mean of 45 minutes; a value of 30 minutes was specified a priori to be clinically important. Future studies should be conducted over longer periods and directly compare different formulations of melatonin with conventional hypnotic and sedative medications. It would also be important to study groups of children with specific neurological disorders. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN05534585.

Methods: Participants involved in an outpatient, one year, multidisciplinary treatment program within a health care setting were studied. After being screened for eligibility, participants in the treatment sample took part in combined standard pharmacologic treatment and non-pharmacologic treatment [including cognitive behavioral therapy/psychoeducational classes, exercise, massage, auricular therapy, microcurrent therapy, and nutritional counseling] in a case controlled manner. A control sample received standard medical care in a rheumatologist's office. Pre- versus post-treatment outcome variables of psychological symptoms and personality features, as measured by the Multiaxial Diagnostic Inventory-Revised, overall impact of FMS as measured by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, overall health status as measured by the Short Form-36, pain and anxiety as measured by visual analog scales, and tender points were assessed for treatment study participants. Data were concurrently collected for the control sample on 26 of the 39 treatment variables, including the Multiaxial Diagnostic Inventory-Revised and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire. Results: Seventy-eight participants took part in the combined pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment. The control sample consisted of 20 eligible participants.

KW  -,Gilles de la Tourette syndrome,adolescent,adult,article,basal ganglion,brain depth stimulation,child,comorbidity,human,pathophysiology,tic","Tourette syndrome (TS) is a disorder characterized by childhood onset multiple motor and vocal tics often accompanied by features of obsessive compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or other behavioral manifestations. Tics may be simple or complex, and may include motor and vocal components. Abnormal function of the basal ganglia is thought to be an important underlying cause of tics and other movement disorders. Treatment of TS requires a thorough understanding of the phenomenology of the disease for the individual patient, and should focus on symptoms that are especially troubling. Some nonpharmacologic approaches may help to improve tic severity, including conditioning techniques, relaxation training, and hypnosis. Options for pharmacotherapy include dopamine blockers and depleters, benzodiazepines, central alpha-adrenergic blockers, and botulinum toxin. Many patients require therapy for comorbid conditions such as anxiety, depression, or ADHD. In case studies and small patient series, deep brain stimulation has been shown to markedly reduce tic severity and functional impairment associated with TS. While onset is most frequently in childhood, TS should not be considered exclusively a disorder of pediatric patients. The complications and comorbidities that are encountered in children and adolescents often persist into adulthood.",2012.0,,V93LL7SU,0,behavior,1488

However, very little is known about the role of dysfunctional attitudes and coping strategies in maintaining and ameliorating distress levels in ways that can inform those developing psychosocial interventions for HIV+ persons. This study evaluated relations between dysfunctional attitudes and depression and examined the role of coping as a mediator of this relationship among 115 19-49 yr old HIV+ symptomatic MSM. Higher Dysfunctional Attitude Scale scores were associated with more reported depressive symptoms. The use of adaptive coping strategies such as active coping was associated with lower depression, whereas use of maladaptive strategies such as denial was related to higher levels of depression. Both adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies mediated the relationship between dysfunctional attitudes and depression. Findings suggest that interventions aiming at reducing psychological distress in this population using cognitive restructuring and related techniques may achieve their effects by enhancing adaptive coping strategies on the one hand and reducing maladaptive strategies on the other.

1490,Process-orientated psychoanalytic work in initial interviews and the importance of the opening scene,"Wegner, P.","From the very first moment of the initial interview to the end of a long course of psychoanalysis, the unconscious exchange between analysand and analyst, and the analysis of the relationship between transference and countertransference, are at the heart of psychoanalytic work. Drawing on initial interviews with a psychosomatically and depressively ill student, a psychoanalytic understanding of initial encounters is worked out. The opening scene of the first interview already condenses the central psychopathology - a clinging to the primary object because it was never securely experienced as present by the patient. The author outlines the development of some psychoanalytic theories concerning the initial interview and demonstrates their specific importance as background knowledge for the clinical situation in the following domains: the 'diagnostic position', the 'therapeutic position', the 'opening scene', the 'countertransference' and the 'analyst's free-floating introspectiveness'. More recent investigations refer to 'process qualities' of the analytic relationship, such as 'synchronization' and 'self-efficacy'. The latter seeks to describe after how much time between the interview sessions constructive or destructive inner processes gain ground in the patient and what significance this may have for the decision about the treatment that follows. All these factors combined can lead to establishing a differential process-orientated indication that also takes account of the fact that being confronted with the fear of unconscious processes of exchange is specific to the psychoanalytic profession.",2014.0,10/gf79m3,LRF9YQ9V,0,psychodynamic,1491
1491,The structure of the OCD brain,"Boedhoe, Premika S. W.; van den Heuvel, Odile A.","The convergence of animal studies and human neuroimaging research points to the involvement of parallel, partly segregated, cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits in behavioral control functions involving motor, cognitive, affective and motivational processes. These CSTC circuits involve direct and indirect pathways projecting from the specific cortical areas to the specific subregions of the striatum and thalamus with recurrent projections to the cortex. Disease models of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) propose that abnormalities in these regions and their connections play an important role in its pathophysiology, and specific CSTC circuits are hypothesised to mediate the specific symptoms of OCD, related to the various functional domains. Findings from functional neuroimaging studies of OCD have validated the involvement of the fronto-striatal, the fronto-limbic, fronto-parietal, and cerebellar regions in the pathophysiology. Data on structural abnormalities are less conclusive but seem to underlie, at least partially, these functional abnormalities. This chapter focuses on the most consistent findings for specific anatomical regions of interest, and discusses their relationship within the implicated networks. It ends with a discussion regarding future directions in OCD research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)",2017.0,,LHTIQDM8,0,additional,1492

Pizzagalli (Biological Psychiatry, Advanced Online Publication, Mar 28, 2017, np). In the original article, the authors have detected typographical errors at several points in the text where the description of a difference score calculation between two time points is incorrect. The analyses themselves are correct and are correctly interpreted in the article. To avoid confusion regarding the difference score calculation used to obtain the reported results, the errors are detailed in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2017-21858-001). BACKGROUND: Stress is widely known to alter behavioral responses to rewards and punishments. It is believed that stress may precipitate these changes through modulation of corticostriatal circuitry involved in reinforcement learning and motivation, although the intervening mechanisms remain unclear. One candidate is inflammation, which can rapidly increase following stress and can disrupt dopamine-dependent reward pathways. METHODS: Here, in a sample of 88 healthy female participants, we first assessed the effect of an acute laboratory stress paradigm on levels of plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine known to be both responsive to stress and elevated in depression. In a second laboratory session, we examined the effects of a second laboratory stress paradigm on reward prediction error (RPE) signaling in the ventral striatum. RESULTS: We show that individual differences in stress-induced increases in IL-6 (session 1) were associated with decreased ventral striatal RPE signaling during reinforcement learning (session 2), though there was no main effect of stress on RPE. Furthermore, changes in IL-6 following stress predicted intraindividual variability in perceived stress during a 4-month follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data identify a novel link between IL-6 and striatal RPEs during reinforcement learning in the context of acute psychological stress, as well as future appraisal of stressful life events.

1495,Combined anxiety and depressive symptoms before diagnosis of breast cancer.,,"PURPOSE: To determine the relationship between pre-diagnosis state anxiety, depressive symptoms, and combined state anxiety and depressive symptoms (CADS) with quality of life (QOL), fatigue, state anxiety and depressive symptoms one and two years after surgery in women with breast cancer. METHODS: Women with breast problems referred to a Dutch outpatient clinic were recruited for the study. Participants (N=428) completed a set of questionnaires before diagnosis (Time0) and the women with breast cancer subsequently received questionnaires at 12 (Time1) and 24 months (Time2) after surgical treatment. The questionnaire set consisted of questionnaires on demographics, state anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue, QOL, neuroticism, and trait anxiety. Chi-square tests, independent samples T-tests, and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to do the analyses. RESULTS: Before their diagnosis of breast cancer, 111 women (28 \ \% \ ) had CADS. Of the CADS-group, a higher percentage had elevated levels of anxiety, depressive symptoms, and CADS at all follow-up moments than of the non-CADS-group. CADS-score at before diagnosis and neuroticism were the most important predictors of outcome measures at Time1 and Time2. CONCLUSIONS: More than one in four women, who later received the diagnosis breast cancer, had elevated levels of both state anxiety and depressive symptoms (CADS) just before diagnosis. This factor was also a major predictor of QOL, state anxiety, depressive symptoms, and fatigue 12 and 24 months after surgery. This implies that women with a higher score on both state anxiety and depressive symptoms should be identified as soon as possible in the process of diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer using validated questionnaires or screening instruments. Only by identifying this group of patients, tailored psychological care can be accomplished.",2012.0,10.1016/j.jad.2011.09.012,PJDFRFQP,0,personality,1496

A.","Purpose: The current study tested the applicability of Jessor's problem behavior theory (PBT) in national probability samples from Georgia and Switzerland. Comparisons focused on (1) the applicability of the problem behavior syndrome (PBS) in both developmental contexts, and (2) on the applicability of employing a set of theory-driven risk and protective factors in the prediction of problem behaviors. Methods: School-based questionnaire data were collected from n = 18,239 adolescents in Georgia (n = 9499) and Switzerland (n = 8740) following the same protocol. Participants rated five measures of problem behaviors (alcohol and drug use, problems because of alcohol and drug use, and deviance), three risk factors (future uncertainty, depression, and stress), and three protective factors (family, peer, and school attachment). Final study samples included n = 9043 Georgian youth (mean age = 15.57; 58.8 \ \% \ females) and n = 8348 Swiss youth (mean age = 17.95; 48.5 \ \% \ females). Data analyses were completed using structural equation modeling, path analyses, and post hoc z-tests for comparisons of regression coefficients. Results: Findings indicated that the PBS replicated in both samples, and that theory-driven risk and protective factors accounted for 13 \ \% \ and 10 \ \% \ in Georgian and Swiss samples, respectively in the PBS, net the effects by demographic variables. Follow-up z-tests provided evidence of some differences in the magnitude, but not direction, in five of six individual paths by country. Conclusion: PBT and the PBS find empirical support in these Eurasian and Western European samples; thus, Jessor's theory holds value and promise in understanding the etiology of adolescent problem behaviors outside of the United States. \ \textcopyright \ 2008 Society for Adolescent Medicine.",2008.0,,A8XY4K7V,0,behavior,1497
1497,Prevalence and impact of peer victimization among gifted adolescents.,"Erwin, Jesse","Few studies directly examine the relationship between giftedness and peer victimization. Despite the limited available data, there is an abundance of prescriptive advice addressing the unique challenges for gifted students. Such advice derives from research on the psychosocial characteristics of gifted youth (at best) or outdated misperceptions of gifted youth as inherently vulnerable (at worst). The purpose of this dissertation was to elucidate the giftedness-victimization link by utilizing measurement and sampling that improve upon research to date. The first goal was to assess victimization frequency of gifted youth and make comparisons to similar non-gifted peers. The second goal was to examine whether victimization was more strongly tied to self-worth, anxiety, and depression for gifted youth compared to their non-gifted peers. At the outset of the study, it was hypothesized that no discernible differences would emerge between gifted and non-gifted students. Data for this dissertation were collected as part of the UCLA Middle School Diversity Project, a multisite longitudinal study of California middle school students from diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds ( N = 6,058). The analytical sample in the current study consisted of 2,888 students in Grade 6, 50 \% of whom had been identified for gifted and talented education (GATE) programs. The other 50 \% consisted of non-GATE students matched on potential covariates using propensity score analysis. Data were collected using surveys in which students reported their experiences with victimization, their self-perceptions, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Contrary to the stated hypotheses, the results indicated that gifted students were victimized significantly less than non-gifted peers for almost every form of victimization. The exception was physical victimization, and several potential interpretations are offered. Analyses examining the impact of victimization were mixed. Victimization was more strongly linked to depressive symptoms for gifted students (b = .049), but significant differences did not emerge on measures of self-worth or anxiety. Although the need for future research is clear, these findings represent a meaningful expansion of knowledge in this area and help to refute simplistic characterizations of gifted youth.

An empirical microanalysis of 4-month mother-infant interaction.,"Beebe, Beatrice; Lachmann, Frank M.; Markese, Sara; Buck, Karen A.; Bahrick, Lorraine E.; Chen, Henian; Cohen, Patricia; Andrews, Howard; Feldstein, Stanley; Jaffe, Joseph","A microanalysis of 4-month mother-infant face-to-face communication predicted 12-month infant disorganized (vs. secure) attachment outcomes in an urban community sample. We documented a dyadic systems view of the roles of both partners; the roles of both self- and interactive contingency; and the importance of attention, orientation, and touch, as well as facial and vocal affect, in the co-construction of attachment disorganization. The analysis of different communication modalities identified striking intrapersonal and interpersonal intermodal discordance or conflict, in the context of intensely distressed infants, as the central feature of future disorganized dyads at 4 months. Lowered maternal contingent coordination, and failures of maternal affective correspondence, constituted maternal emotional withdrawal from distressed infants. This maternal withdrawal compromises infant interactive agency and emotional coherence. We characterize of the nature of emerging internal working models of future disorganized infants as follows: Future disorganized infants represent states of not being sensed and known by their mothers, particularly in moments of distress; they represent confusion about both their own and their mothers' basic emotional organization, and about their mothers' response to their distress. This internal working model sets a trajectory in development which may disturb the fundamental integration of the person. The remarkable specificity of our findings has the potential to lead to more finely focused clinical interventions.

1501,Training In a Good Way : Evaluating the effect of a culturally responsive pre-training intervention on learning and motivation.,"Murry, Adam Thomas","Employee Training and Development (T \& D) is a crucial component to an organization's success and its ability to remain competitive. Fortunately,Although researchers in the field have discovered ways to enhance the effectiveness of training programs throughout the design, delivery, and evaluation process,. Unfortunately, research has not provided empirically-based recommendations for how to best train individuals whose cultural backgrounds may influence the receptivenesson of a training curriculum. This is particularly relevant for employees whose cultural groups have been historically discriminated against, where cultural norms implicit in the training design may be met with resistance on behalf of the trainees. In the field of multicultural education, an instructional approach has been suggested to overcome cultural differences between instructor, curriculum writers, and students known as culturally responsive education. I evaluated a pre-training video prime based on this approach in the context of multi-site data-usage training programs for Native American adultseducational professionals. Data-usage trainings were was delivered after exposure to one of two videos that framed the objectives of data use either in a culturally responsive way or in a generic mainstream fashion. Participants filled out surveys after the video but before the training, and then again after the training. Prime type was randomly assigned by training locationTraining locations were randomly assigned to receive one or the other video as a training primer. I hypothesized that participants who received a culturally responsive training primer would learn more during the data-usage training than participants who did not, and that this effect would be mediated by heightened affective motivators immediately following the culturally responsive primer. None of my the hypotheses hypothesized pathways were supported. There was no direct effect of my prime manipulation on knowledge (Hypothesis 1) or skill acquisition (H2), or on pre-training motivation to learn (H3), research-related self-efficacy (H4), goal-commitment (H5), or identification with research (H6). Furthermore, there were no indirect effects of my manipulation on knowledge (H7) or skill (H8) acquisition through pre-training motivation to learn, self-efficacy, goal-commitment, or identification with research. The motivation to learn subscale for valence had a significant positive direct effect on knowledge and skill acquisition and self-efficacy significantly positively predicted skill acquisition. Goal-commitment and motivation to learn subscales for instrumentality and expectancy had a significant negative relationship with skill acquisition. Lack of support for my hypothesized pathways is explained partially by the failure of my independent variable to influence perceptions of cultural responsiveness. A manipulation check revealed that participants did not appraise my culturally responsive priming video as significantly more relevant or culturally appropriate compared to the alternative mainstream video. Findings on the positive effects of valence and self-efficacy are discussed in support of current literature. Negative effects of expectancy are discussed in terms of stereotype threat. The implications and applications for trainers and researchers in training and , minority education are followed by a consideration of this study's limitations and suggestions for future research.

1502,Psychological therapies for the management of chronic and recurrent pain in children and adolescents.,"Eccleston, Christopher; Palermo, Tonya M.; Williams, Amanda C. de C. and","BACKGROUND: This is an update of the original Cochrane review first published in Issue 1, 2003, and previously updated in 2009 and 2012. Chronic pain affects many children, who report severe pain, disability, and distressed mood. Psychological therapies are emerging as effective interventions to treat children with chronic or recurrent pain. This update focuses specifically on psychological therapies delivered face-to-face, adds new randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and additional data from previously included trials. OBJECTIVES: There were three objectives to this review. First, to determine the effectiveness on clinical outcomes of pain severity, disability, depression, and anxiety of psychological therapy delivered face-to-face for chronic and recurrent pain in children and adolescents compared with active treatment, waiting-list, or standard medical care. Second, to evaluate the impact of psychological therapies on depression and anxiety, which were previously combined as 'mood'. Third, we assessed the risk of bias of the included studies and the quality of outcomes using the GRADE criteria. SEARCH METHODS: Searches were undertaken of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO. We searched for further RCTs in the references of all identified studies, meta-analyses, and reviews. Trial registry databases were also searched. The date of most recent search was January 2014. SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs with at least 10 participants in each arm post-treatment comparing psychological therapies with active treatment, standard medical care, or waiting-list control for children or adolescents with episodic, recurrent or persistent pain were eligible for inclusion. Only trials conducted in person (face-to-face) were considered. Studies that delivered treatment remotely were excluded from this update. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: All included studies were analysed and the quality of outcomes were assessed. All treatments were combined into one class, psychological treatments. Pain conditions were split into headache and non-headache. Both conditions were assessed on four outcomes: pain, disability, depression, and anxiety. Data were extracted at two time points; post-treatment (immediately or the earliest data available following end of treatment) and at follow-up (between three and 12 months post-treatment). MAIN RESULTS: Seven papers were identified in the updated search. Of these papers, five presented new trials and two presented follow-up data for previously included trials. Five studies that were previously included in this review were excluded as therapy was delivered remotely. The review thus included a total of 37 studies. The total number of participants completing treatments was 2111. Twenty studies addressed treatments for headache (including migraine); nine for abdominal pain; two for mixed pain conditions including headache pain, two for fibromyalgia, two for recurrent abdominal pain or irritable bowel syndrome, and two for pain associated with sickle cell disease.Analyses revealed psychological therapies to be beneficial for children with chronic pain on seven outcomes. For headache pain, psychological therapies reduced pain post-treatment and at follow-up respectively (risk ratio (RR) 2.47, 95 \% confidence interval (CI) 1.97 to 3.09, z = 7.87, p \textless 0.01, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 2.94; RR 2.89, 95 \% CI 1.03 to 8.07, z = 2.02, p \textless 0.05, NNTB = 3.67). Psychological therapies also had a small beneficial effect at reducing disability in headache conditions post-treatment and at follow-up respectively (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.49, 95 \% CI -0.74 to -0.24, z = 3.90, p \textless 0.01; SMD -0.46, 95 \% CI -0.78 to -0.13, z = 2.72, p \textless 0.01). No beneficial effect was found on depression post-treatment (SMD -0.18, 95 \% CI -0.49 to 0.14, z = 1.11, p \textgreater 0.05). At follow-up, only one study was eligible, therefore no analysis was possible and no conclusions can be drawn.

RESULTS: Depressed adolescents were found to have significantly more negative self-concepts and significantly less social self-confidence than either comparison group. They did not differ from the other adolescents in either social problem-solving ability or interpersonal understanding. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that depressed adolescents have unique deficits in social self-evaluation which contribute to ineffective social behavior and the maintenance of dysphoric affect.

L.; Buchwald, D.","Although anecdotal reports suggest that anxiety and depressive disorders may be precipitated by acute infectious mononucleosis (AIM), there are few population-based studies measuring distress and psychiatric disorder during and after infection. The purpose of this research was to study the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and psychological distress in patients with AIM at initial infection and over the subsequent 6 months. In addition, we examined the correlation of baseline biopsychosocial factors with distress at 2 and 6 months post-illness. A population-based cohort with AIM was surveyed at initial infection and at 2- and 6-month follow-up visits. Measures included physical and laboratory examinations, trait and state measures of psychological and somatic distress, locus of control, social support, and functioning. Patients also received a structured psychiatric interview during the initial infection. Although transient psychological distress was common during acute infection, few patients met criteria for DSM-III-R psychiatric illness. Greater distress at 2 months was associated with significantly lower social functioning in the month prior to diagnosis and higher aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT/AST) levels, less confidence in the physician and health care system (locus of control), and less severe physical symptoms of AIM at baseline. Greater distress at 6 months was associated with an increased number of adverse life events in the 6 months after developing AIM and more days of reduced activity in the 2 weeks prior to the onset of AIM. This population-based study suggests that few subjects develop DSM-III-R psychiatric disorders with AIM. Both biological and psychosocial factors are highly correlated with psychosocial distress at 2 months, whereas psychosocial factors are more important at 6-month follow-up.",1999.0,10.1016/S0163-8343(98)00068-1,HJDSSL2B,0,diathesis,1506
1506,Repetition of deliberate self-harm by adolescents: the role of psychological factors.,"Hawton, K.; Kingsbury, S.; Steinhardt, K.; James, A.; Fagg, J.","The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between psychological variables and repetition of deliberate self-harm by adolescents (n=45) aged 13-18 years who had been admitted to a general hospital having taken overdoses. Standardized measures of depression, hopelessness, suicidal intent, impulsivity, trait and state anger, self-esteem and problem-solving (both self-report and observer-rated) were administered to the adolescents while still in the general hospital. Repetition was assessed on the basis of previous overdoses (n=14) and repetition of self-harm (self-poisoning and self-injury) during the subsequent year (n=9). Adolescents with a history of a previous overdose and/or who repeated self-harm during the following year (n=18) differed from non-repeaters in having higher scores for depression, hopelessness and trait anger, and lower scores for self-esteem, self-rated problem-solving and effectiveness of problem-solving rated on the basis of the Means End Problem Solving test, all measured at the initial assessment. These differences largely disappeared when level of depression was controlled for. Similarly, differences found between repeaters and non-repeaters in the year following the index overdoses for problem-solving were much reduced when account was taken of differences in depression scores. Depression is a key factor associated with risk of repetition of adolescent self-harm (and hence of suicide risk). In the management of adolescents who have harmed themselves, careful assessment of depression and appropriate management of those who are depressed is essential.",1999.0,10.1006/jado.1999.0228,B798LX94,0,behavior,1507

AIMS: This randomized study tests the efficacy of treatment-as-usual supplemented with a psychoeducative programme for patients with recurrent depression, treated at Community Mental Health Centres (CMHC) in Denmark. The primary outcome measurements concern was decline in consumption of psychiatric inpatient services and decline in Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI). METHODS: Eighty patients were randomized, either to the psychoeducative programme (consisting of eight sessions, each of 2 hours duration) and 2-year outpatient follow-up (42 cases), or only to 2-year outpatient follow-up (38 controls). The patients were monitored during 2 years after randomization. Data were collected from interviews including BDI, drug treatment and social measurements, and register data concerning use of psychiatric services. RESULTS: At 2-year follow-up, a significant reduction in the consumption of psychiatric inpatient services and in BDI was found; however, it was uniform for case and control patients.

1508,Reported parental behaviour and adult affective symptoms. 2. Mediating factors,"Rodgers, B.","Potential mediators of the modest association between retrospectively rated parental behaviour and adult affective symptoms in offspring were investigated in a national longitudinal study of a cohort followed to the age of 43. Personality measures from adolescence could account for a small part of this association. Personal relationships in adulthood were more strongly associated with both parental behaviour and symptoms: marital history, emotional support, social network and availability of help in a crisis. Poor parenting did not lead to a general vulnerability to later life events, and socio-economic status and financial hardship were not implicated in the link between parental behaviour and adult symptoms. However, parental affectionless control was associated with certain types of life stressors in adulthood, i.e. interpersonal as opposed to non-interpersonal life events. Collectively, aspects of personal relationships accounted for much of the elevated symptom levels in those rating parents as low on care or high on control. Findings were consistent with the notion that interpersonal competence is important in the continuity between childhood experience and adult mental health, but other possible interpretations are discussed.",1996.0,,XZKRIY4V,0,personality,1509
1509,"The neuroprogressive nature of major depressive disorder: Pathways to disease evolution and resistance, and therapeutic implications","Moylan, S.; Maes, M.; Wray, N. R.; Berk, M.","In some patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), individual illness characteristics appear consistent with those of a neuroprogressive illness. Features of neuroprogression include poorer symptomatic, treatment and functional outcomes in patients with earlier disease onset and increased number and length of depressive episodes. In such patients, longer and more frequent depressive episodes appear to increase vulnerability for further episodes, precipitating an accelerating and progressive illness course leading to functional decline. Evidence from clinical, biochemical and neuroimaging studies appear to support this model and are informing novel therapeutic approaches. This paper reviews current knowledge of the neuroprogressive processes that may occur in MDD, including structural brain consequences and potential molecular mechanisms including the role of neurotransmitter systems, inflammatory, oxidative and nitrosative stress pathways, neurotrophins and regulation of neurogenesis, cortisol and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis modulation, mitochondrial dysfunction and epigenetic and dietary influences. Evidence-based novel treatments informed by this knowledge are discussed. \textcopyright 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",2013.0,10.1038/mp.2012.33,2RIMRLYV,0,diathesis,1510
1510,The prevalence and correlates of adult separation anxiety disorder in an anxiety clinic.,"Silove, Derrick M.; Marnane, Claire L.; Wagner, Renate; Manicavasagar, Vijaya L.; Rees, Susan","BACKGROUND: Adult separation anxiety disorder (ASAD) has been identified recently, but there is a paucity of data about its prevalence and associated characteristics amongst anxiety patients. This study assessed the prevalence and risk factor profile associated with ASAD in an anxiety clinic. METHODS: Clinical psychologists assigned 520 consecutive patients to DSM-IV adult anxiety subcategories using the SCID. We also measured demographic factors and reports of early separation anxiety (the Separation Anxiety Symptom Inventory and a retrospective diagnosis of childhood separation anxiety disorder). Other self-report measures included the Adult Separation Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (ASA-27), the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales (DASS-21), personality traits measured by the NEO PI-R and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale. These measures were included in three models examining for overall differences and then by gender: Model 1 compared the conventional SCID anxiety subtypes (excluding PTSD and OCD because of insufficient numbers); Model 2 divided the sample into those with and without ASAD; Model 3 compared those with ASAD with the individual anxiety subtypes in the residual group. RESULTS: Patients with ASAD had elevated early separation anxiety scores but this association was unique in females only. Except for social phobia in relation to some comparisons, those with ASAD recorded more severe symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, higher neuroticism scores, and greater levels of disability. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ASAD attending an anxiety clinic are highly symptomatic and disabled. The findings have implications for the classification, clinical identification and treatment of adult anxiety disorders.",2010.0,10.1186/1471-244X-10-21,MEFDK5W2,0,personality,1511

Questionnaires assessing parent-adolescent conflict resolution behaviors, adolescent-romantic partner conflict resolution behaviors, and adolescent attachment anxiety and depressive symptoms were completed by 256 college students (198 females and 58 males). Using hierarchical regression analyses, statistical models were tested wherein adolescent-romantic partner conflict resolution behaviors were regressed on mother-adolescent and father-adolescent conflict resolution behaviors and adolescents' attachment anxiety and depressive symptoms. All four predictor variables explained significant portions of the variance in adolescent-romantic partner conflict resolution behaviors; however, different predictors were found for females and males. For females, mother-adolescent and father-adolescent conflict resolution strategies and adolescent attachment anxiety were significant predictors. In contrast, father-adolescent conflict resolution behaviors and adolescent depressive symptoms were significant predictors for males...

1512,Frequency of alcohol use disorders in patients admitted in a psychiatric hospital according to admission diagnosis,"Gammeter, R.; Nay, C.; Bissery, A.; Leutwyler, J.; Bonsack, C.; Besson, J.; Kaufmann, N.; Daeppen, J. B.","Background: Comorbidities such as mental illness and alcohol use disorders (AUD) worsen the prognosis of both conditions. There is a need to identify early alcohol use disorders in psychiatric patients to prevent the development of dual diagnosis diseases, which are more difficult to treat. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) was developed by the World Health Organisation to promote early identification of alcohol use disorders and has been validated mainly in primary care settings. No study has validated the AUDIT in a French-speaking psychiatric setting. There is also a need to identify the risk factors of heavy drinking with psychiatric disorders. Purpose: This study aims at (1) validating the French version of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification test (AUDIT) for psychiatric inpatients and (2) determining the frequency of alcohol use disorders in four major psychiatric ICD-10 diagnostic categories: neurotic and depressive disorders (F3 and F4), personality disorders (F6), psychotic disorders (F2) and other disorders (n = 10). Subjects and methods: Of 383 consecutive psychiatric admissions, 219 completed the AUDIT. A subset was also interviewed with the CIDI (gold standard) and was retested with the AUDIT. Psychiatric diagnoses were recorded from hospital medical records. Results: Validation of the AUDIT showed a very good sensitivity (94.1 \ \% \ ) and specificity (91.7 \ \% \ ) in this psychiatric inpatient population. Frequency of alcohol use disorders was 35.1 \ \% \ . Personality disorders had the highest rate of AUDIT scores ≥8 (50.7 \ \% \ ). Gender was the only statistically significant outcome in a multivariate model. Discussion: Male sex as an outcome associated with the presence of alcohol use disorders, is consistent with the other AUDIT studies in psychiatry. The uniqueness of the present study is the evaluation of personality disorders among the psychiatric diagnostic categories. Conclusion: This study strengthens the evidence that the AUDIT is reliable and valid with psychiatric patients and confirms the high frequency of alcohol use disorders in this population. Drinking habits of patients with emotionally labile personality disorders should be screened.",2006.0,,HK8KIIBL,0,personality,1513
1513,Meta-cognitive beliefs as a mediator for the relationship between Cloninger's temperament and character dimensions and depressive and anxiety symptoms among healthy subjects,"Gawȩda, L.; Kokoszka, Andrzej; Gaweda, Lukasz; Kokoszka, Andrzej","Background Previous studies suggest that temperament and character may impact depression and anxiety through dysfunctional cognition. This study targets the mediating role of meta-cognitive beliefs in the relationship between Cloninger's temperament and character dimensions and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Method One hundred and sixty-one healthy subjects filled out Cloninger's Temperament Character Inventory (TCI), a Metacognitions Questionnaire (MCQ), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Correlation and mediation analyses according to Baron and Kenny's method were performed. Results Harm avoidance (HA) and self-directedness (SD) were related to depression and anxiety. HA was related to negative beliefs about uncontrollability of thoughts and to beliefs about cognitive confidence. SD was associated with the same types of meta-cognitive beliefs and with general negative beliefs. Cooperativeness (CO) was related to positive beliefs about worry, beliefs about cognitive confidence and to general negative beliefs. Self-transcendence (ST) was related to all types of meta-cognitive beliefs. Mediation analysis revealed that the relationship between HA and depression and anxiety is partially mediated by certain types of meta-cognitive beliefs the same results were obtained for the relationship between SD and depression and anxiety. General negative beliefs fully mediated the relationship between CO and depression and the relationship between ST and anxiety. Conclusions Meta-cognitive beliefs mediate the relationship between temperament and character dimension and depressive and anxiety symptoms, thus providing further evidence for the meta-cognitive theory of emotional disorders as presented by Wells and Matthews (Behav Res Ther 1996;32:867-870). \ \textcopyright \ 2014 Elsevier Inc.",2014.0,10.1016/j.comppsych.2013.10.013,AW7TVM83,0,personality,1514

M.; Cho, S. M.; Lee, S. H.; Chung, Y. K.","This study prospectively examined the relationships among cognitive factors and severity of Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in female victims of sexual violence. Thirty-eight victims of sexual violence recruited from Center for Women Victims of Sexual and Domestic Violence at Ajou University Hospital. Cognitive factors and PTSD symptom were assessed within 4 months of sexual violence and 25 victims were followed-up 1 month after initial assessment. Repeated-measured ANOVA revealed that PTSD incidence and severity decreased over the month (F [1, 21]=6.61). Particularly, avoidant symptoms might decrease earlier than other PTSD symptoms (F [1, 21]=5.92). This study also showed the significant relationship between early negative trauma-related thoughts and subsequent PTSD severity. Shame and guilt proneness had significant cross-sectional correlations with PTSD severity, but did not show associations when depression severity is controlled. Our results suggest that avoidant symptoms might decrease earlier than other PTSD symptoms during the acute phase and that cognitive appraisals concerning the dangerousness of the world seem to play an important role in the maintenance of PTSD (r=0.499, P \textless 0.05).",2014.0,,CGF98WIQ,0,psychodynamic,1515
1515,The impact of forced displacement in World War II on mental health disorders and health-related quality of life in late life-a German population-based study,"Freitag, S.; Braehler, E.; Schmidt, S.; Glaesmer, H.","Background: Long-term effects of World War II experiences affect psychological and physical health in aged adults. Forced displacement as a traumatic event is associated with increased psychological burden even after several decades. This study investigates the contribution of forced displacement as a predictor for mental health disorders and adds the aspect of health-related quality of life (QoL). Method: A sample of 1,659 German older adults aged 60-85 years was drawn from a representative survey. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), somatoform symptoms, depressive syndromes, and health-related QoL were assessed as outcome variables. Chi-square and t-test statistics examined differences between displaced and non-displaced people. Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the impact of forced displacement on mental health disorders and QoL. Results: Displaced people reported higher levels of PTSD, depressive and somatoform symptoms, and lower levels of health-related QoL. Displacement significantly predicted PTSD and somatoform symptoms in late life, but not depressive disorders. Health-related QoL was predicted by forced displacement and socio-demographic variables. Conclusion: Forced displacement is associated with an elevated risk for PTSD and somatoform symptoms and lowered health-related QoL in aged adults. Its unique impact declines after including socio-demographic variables. Long-term consequences of forced displacement need further investigations and should include positive aspects in terms of resilience and protective coping strategies. \textcopyright 2012 International Psychogeriatric Association.",2013.0,10.1017/S1041610212001585,KZ6ZVA9K,0,diathesis,1516

C.; Meyer, T.; Watz, H.; Magnussen, H.","Background: Systemic effects of COPD are incompletely reflected by established prognostic assessments. We determined the prognostic value of objectively measured physical activity in comparison with established predictors of mortality and evaluated the prognostic value of noninvasive assessments of cardiovascular status, biomarkers of systemic inflammation, and adipokines. Methods: In a prospective cohort study of 170 outpatients with stable COPD (mean FEV1, 56 \% predicted), we assessed lung function by spirometry and body plethysmography; physical activity level (PAL) by a multisensory armband; exercise capacity by 6-min walk distance test; cardiovascular status by echocardiography, vascular Doppler sonography (ankle-brachial index [ABI]), and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level; nutritional and muscular status by BMI and fat-free mass index; biomarkers by levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, IL-6, fibrinogen, adiponectin, and leptin; and health status, dyspnea, and depressive symptoms by questionnaire. Established prognostic indices were calculated. The median follow-up was 48 months (range, 10-53 months). Results: All-cause mortality was 15.4 \% . After adjustments, each 0.14 increase in PAL was associated with a lower risk of death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95 \% CI, 0.33-0.64; P \textless .001). Compared with established predictors, PAL showed the best discriminative properties for 4-year survival (C statistic, 0.81) and was associated with the highest relative risk of death per standardized decrease. Novel predictors of mortality were adiponectin level (HR, 1.34; 95 \% CI, 1.06-1.71; P = .017), leptin level (HR, 0.81; 95 \% CI, 0.65-0.99; P = .042), right ventricular function (Tei-index) (HR, 1.26; 95 \% CI, 1.04-1.54; P = .020), and ABI \textless 1.00 (HR, 3.87; 95 \% CI, 1.44-10.40; P = .007). A stepwise Cox regression revealed that the best model of independent predictors was PAL, adiponectin level, and ABI. The composite of these factors further improved the discriminative properties (C statistic, 0.85). Conclusions: We found that objectively measured physical activity is the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality in patients with COPD. In addition, adiponectin level and vascular status provide independent prognostic information in our cohort. \textcopyright 2011 American College of Chest Physicians.",2011.0,10.1378/chest.10-2521,Q9K4EZGK,0,cognitive_additional,1517

Research suggests that a pattern of global, stable, and possibly internal attributions for positive events might even trigger mania. We tested whether hypothesized risk factors for bipolar disorder are associated with such attributions after feedback of success in an ability- and chance-based test. University students (n = 115) completed the Behavioral Inhibition and Behavioral Activation Scales (BIS/BAS) and the Hypomanic Personality Scale (HPS) to assess risk for bipolar disorder. In addition, participants were interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview. All participants performed an ability-based (intelligence) test and a chance-based (dice-throwing) test, and success was induced by providing positive feedback regardless of their actual test performance. Attributions of perceived success were assessed after each test. Results showed that high scores on the BAS scale were generally predictive of self-serving attributions in the ability-based test, while scores on the HPS predicted a more global and self-serving attributional style in the chance-based test. Current depression, lifetime affective disorder, BIS, or the dysregulation of the BAS did not consistently predict attributions on either test. Despite some methodological limitations, results suggest that anticipated or experienced success in skill-related contexts triggers self-serving attributions in individuals scoring high on the BAS scale, while perceived positive outcome in chance-related, more unrealistic contexts triggers similar attributions in individuals scoring high on the HPS. Future research has to examine whether these overly positive attributions after positive, chance-related situations are a stable characteristic with respect to vulnerability to mania.

M.; Siebner, H. R.; Frokjaer, V. G.","Sex-hormone fluctuations may increase risk for developing depressive symptoms and alter emotional processing as supported by observations in menopausal and pre- to postpartum transition. In this double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, we used blood−oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate if sex-steroid hormone manipulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) influences emotional processing. Fifty-six healthy women were investigated twice: at baseline (follicular phase of menstrual cycle) and 16±3 days post intervention. At both sessions, fMRI-scans during exposure to faces expressing fear, anger, happiness or no emotion, depressive symptom scores and estradiol levels were acquired. The fMRI analyses focused on regions of interest for emotional processing. As expected, GnRHa initially increased and subsequently reduced estradiol to menopausal levels, which was accompanied by an increase in subclinical depressive symptoms relative to placebo. Women who displayed larger GnRHa-induced increase in depressive symptoms had a larger increase in both negative and positive emotion-elicited activity in the anterior insula. When considering the post-GnRHa scan only, depressive responses were associated with emotion-elicited activity in the anterior insula and amygdala. The effect on regional activity in anterior insula was not associated with the estradiol net decline, only by the GnRHa-induced changes in mood. Our data implicate enhanced insula recruitment during emotional processing in the emergence of depressive symptoms following sex-hormone fluctuations.

1524,Symposium Monograph Supplement.,"authorship Indicated, No","Many medical disorders are associated with a high rate of depression, including autoimmune disorders (cytokine hypothesis), metabolic disorders (hypercorticolemia hypothesis, impaired neurogenesis), vascular disorders (vascular depression hypothesis), neoplasms (leukemia, lymphoma, pancreatic carcinoma), and viral infections (hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus). In such cases, both the medical and depressive disorders need to be treated simultaneously. For example, if a depressed patient has a high thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), suppressing the TSH with thyroxin may bring the patient into partial remission. However, if only the depression is treated (eg, with an SSRI), the patient will at best achieve partial remission. Depressed patients responded well to problem-solving therapy (PST), which is a simplified form of comorbid behavioral therapy. After discussing several studies. it is concluded that antidepressants alone may not always be a sufficient treatment for depressed elderly people, and psychotherapies should be considered. Medical comorbidity contributes to depression significantly and it is important to treat both depression and medical diseases contributing to depression simultaneously whenever possible.

In addition, it tested the role of attribution changes in mediating the intervention effects on children's depressive and emotional symptoms. The participants were 109 Finnish families with at least one parent in treatment for affective disorder, for a total of 145 children, 8-16 years of age. Families were randomized into two groups: the family talk intervention (FTI, a whole-family approach enhancing communication and child resilience, Beardslee et al., 1997) group, and an active control, the let's talk about the children (LTC, a parent-only psycho-educational approach, Solantaus, Paavonen, Toikka, \& Punamaki, 2010) group.

Contrary to our hypothesis, no beneficial attribution changes were found in the FTI group across the follow-ups. Instead, positive cognitive appraisals increased in the LTC group, especially from T2 to T3.

G.","BACKGROUND: Levels of mental distress are high in patients with substance use disorders (SUD) and investigation of correlates may broaden our understanding of this comorbidity. OBJECTIVES: We investigated self-reported symptoms of mental distress among individuals entering either outpatient opioid maintenance treatment (OMT) or other inpatient SUD treatment and related factors, with a particular focus on perceived self-control. METHODS: A cross-sectional study including substance users (n = 548; mean age 34 years; 27% women) entering treatment at 21 different treatment-centers across Norway, interviewed between December 2012 and April 2015. Symptoms of mental distress were assessed with Global Symptom Index (GSI) score. Adjusted relative risk ratios (RRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated through multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: More than half of the participants in both treatment groups reported mental distress (GSI) above clinical cut-off. The use of alcohol and exposure to violence were associated with increased likelihood of high GSI for both patient groups. Also, lower perceived self-control was related to high GSI in both treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Symptoms of mental distress were equally common among patients entering OMT and those entering other inpatient SUD treatment, even if the patients differed on a number of clinical characteristics. Use of alcohol and exposure to violence were associated with more mental distress in both groups. Perceived self-control also appeared to be important when explaining symptoms of mental distress among these SUD patients.",2018.0,10.1080/10826084.2017.1413114,QQI4TG3S,0,additional,1532
1532,"The relationship of yoga, self-objectification, disordered eating, and depressed mood in college-aged women.","Woolley, Lauren M.","According to objectification theorists (Fredrickson \& Roberts, 1997), sexual objectification of the female body contributes to mental health problems which disproportionately affect girls and women including eating disorders and depression. They postulated that living in a culture which sexually objectifies the female body socializes girls and women to view their bodies from a third-person perspective. Fredrickson and Roberts referred to this process as self-objectification and asserted it has negative mental health consequences (e.g., body shame, appearance anxiety) for girls and women. They posited participation in sports programs could buffer girls and women from the harmful effects of sexual objectification. Previous research (Daubenmier, 2005; Impett, Daubenmier, \& Hirschman, 2006) indicated that yoga was an effective method for protecting women from engaging in self-objectification. This investigator tested whether yoga practice was associated with lower levels of self-objectification and its related consequences in college-aged women. The roles of habitual body monitoring, body shame, appearance anxiety, flow, and awareness of internal bodily states in the link between self-objectification and disordered eating and self-objectification and depressed mood in this population was also examined. Three hundred seventy-five college-aged women completed measures of self-objectification and its proposed costs. The sample included women who practiced yoga (yoginis), physically active (PA) women (engaged in non-yoga physical activity three or more hours per week), and sedentary/low physically active (SLPA) women (engaged in non-yoga physical activity zero to two hours per week). The yoginis exhibited lower levels of self-objectification compared to women in the SLPA group and greater levels of flow and internal bodily awareness compared to women in the PA and SLPA groups. Participants in the SLPA group exhibited more depressive symptoms compared to participants in the PA group and the yoginis. For the entire sample, appearance anxiety fully mediated the relationship between self-objectification and disordered eating and depressive symptoms. These findings have implications for psychologists who treat college-aged women and university student wellness programs.

1533,The creative transformation of trauma: Marcel Proust's in search of lost time,"Blum, H. P.","Hidden childhood trauma beneath poignant memories is a central aspect of In Search of Lost Time. Marcel Proust's magnum opus may be psychoanalytically understood as an extraordinary literary transformation of severe trauma and associated unconscious conflicts. Proust's nearly fatal childhood asthma and concomitant medical mistreatment contributed to an intense ambivalent bond and bondage with his mother, replicated in the ambivalent relationships depicted in his novel. The retrieved and re-created past is relived in the novel's fantasy playground of time and space. Proust's intuitive grasp of significant aspects of time, memory, trauma, and transference was consistent with psychoanalytic thought. In the vast novel, the narcissistic mortification and losses of the protagonist are mourned, worked through, and partially redeemed. I interpret the famed joyous tasting of the madeleine in tea as an artfully disguised, temporally displaced, and affective reversal of life-threatening trauma. This article probes the role of Proust's intractable asthma in his breathless journey to ego mastery and timeless creativity. \textcopyright 2012 N.P.A.P.",2012.0,10/gg4n6t,VQU27UN2,0,psychodynamic,1534

In the present study, 147 community women completed a diagnostic interview and a battery of self-report inventories approximately eight weeks after childbirth. The rate of generalized anxiety disorder was elevated as compared to the rate in women representative of the general population. Depending on the particular domain of anxiety being considered, 10-50 \% of women reporting anxiety symptoms endorsed comorbid depressive symptoms. In hierarchical multiple regression analyses, different combinations of demographic and vulnerability variables predicted symptoms of somatic anxiety, social anxiety, and depression, although there were no significant predictors of worry symptoms. In addition, number of children, depression, and social anxiety predicted postpartum relationship distress. These results suggest that postpartum anxiety disorders are more common than postpartum depression and worthy of systematic study.",2005.0,10.1016/j.janxdis.2004.04.001,NCBH8ZDP,0,cognitive_additional,1535

However, little is known of the long-term psychological effects for asymptomatic persons learning their risk of having a serious disease. Predictive genetic testing for Huntington's disease (HD) has been offered for the longest time for any disease. In the present study, the psychological consequences of predictive testing were assessed prospectively in individuals at risk for HD during seven visits over 5 years. Questionnaires of standard measures of psychological distress (the General Severity Index of the Symptom Check List-90-Revised), depression (the Beck Depression Inventory), and general well-being (the General Well-Being Scale) were administered to the participants. A significant reduction in psychological distress was observed for both result groups throughout 2 years (p \textless 0.001) and at 5 years (p = 0.002). Despite the overall improvement of the psychological well-being, 6.9 \% (14 of 202) of the participants experienced an adverse event during the first 2 years after predictive testing that was clinically significant.

1538,Patients' reports of the factors influencing medication adherence in bipolar disorder - an integrative review of the literature.,"Crowe, Marie; Wilson, Lynere; Inder, Maree","BACKGROUND: As with other long-term conditions patients with bipolar disorder are rarely totally adherent or non-adherent. Rates of non-adherence have not changed since the first introduction of psychotropic medications in the 1950s despite vast numbers of new compounds being marketed. Non-adherence with medication in bipolar disorder is associated with affective relapse and consequently poor quality of life. The reasons that patients are non-adherent with medication are not well understood by clinicians who often assume it is related to the illness itself. OBJECTIVES: To identify patients' perceptions of medication adherence in bipolar disorder. DESIGN: An integrated review of the literature published between 1999 and 2010. DATA SOURCES: Ovid (Medline, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO) and manual searching. REVIEW METHODS: An integrative review of the literature was conducted which included: (a) problem formation, (b) literature search and initial screening, (c) gathering data from studies, (d) evaluating study quality, (e) data analysis and integration, (f) data interpretation, and (g) presentation of the findings. RESULTS: Thirteen articles met criteria for inclusion in the review. These articles identified how patients reported their perceptions on medication and were integrated into four categories: illness factors, personal attitudes and beliefs, medication factors and environmental factors. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a need to address adherence from the full range of influencing factors (patient, illness, medication and environmental). Clinicians need to utilise a collaborative approach to working together with patients in order to identify the meaning that patients attribute to the symptoms, diagnosis, prognosis and medication. Understanding patients' perceptions and accepting these may facilitate greater medication adherence and the consequent improved clinical outcomes for patients with bipolar disorder.",2011.0,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2011.03.008,Z3XB7IBL,0,cognitive,1539

Background PMDs are often disabling but no uniformly successful treatment has been identified. Short term psychodynamic psychotherapy was successful in improving PMDs in 10 patients used in open label fashion (Hinson, 2006). Design/Methods: Fifteen patients with PMDs seen in a Movement Disorders clinic were randomized to immediate versus delayed (after 3 months) weekly psychodynamic psychotherapy for 12 weeks. During the phase without psychiatric intervention, they were monitored by a treating neurologist. Patients were assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months using a clinical global impression scale change of their movement disorder (CGI-c), Hamilton depression scale (HAM-D) and Beck anxiety inventory (Beck-A). Results: Fourteen women and one man, age 42.3+ 11, disease duration 63.2+ 73 months, were randomized to immediate (7 patients) or delayed (8 patients) treatment. The primary diagnosis was conversion (8 patients), somatoform disorder not otherwise specified (5 patients), and somatization (2 patients). Nine patients carried the diagnosis of depression combined with anxiety in 3. Six patients had tremor, 5 myoclonus, 1 dystonia, 7 gait and 2 speech involvement.

1542,The influence of trait anxiety on autonomic response and cognitive performance during an anticipatory anxiety task,"Barrett, J.; Armony, J. L.","The interaction between emotion and cognition is thought to be intimately involved in the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders. In a set of studies, we investigated whether trait anxiety modulates cognitive performance and autonomic activity during an anticipatory anxiety task. Participants completed a letter-size decision-making task with two alternating 28-32 s background screen color-blocks. One of the colors was associated with the presentation of an aversive noise [unconditioned stimulus (UCS)]. Participants were aware of the background color that would (CTX+) and would not (CTX-) be paired with the UCS but did not know when or how often the UCS would be presented. Two experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, the UCS was presented during the decision-making task in the CTX+ color-blocks using a partial reinforcement schedule. Different noises were presented each time to increase unpredictability and prevent habituation. In Experiment 2, the UCS was never presented during the decision-making task. Results suggested that only the paradigm used in Experiment 1 was successful in eliciting anticipatory anxiety. In Experiment 1, continuously measured skin conductance response (SCR) data suggested that anxiety was significantly greater during CTX+ compared to CTX- trials; no SCR differences were found between high and low trait-anxious participants. Results further indicated that high trait-anxious participants responded significantly faster on the decision-making task during CTX+ compared to CTX- trials, whereas low trait-anxious participants displayed the opposite pattern. Our results reveal an interesting dissociation between the effects of individual differences in trait anxiety on autonomic activity and cognitive performance during an anticipatory anxiety task. \textcopyright 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",2006.0,,RFBG3ZPI,0,behavior,1543

Thirty families were entered into a wait-list controlled study in an outpatient setting (n = 18 treatment group; n = 12 waitlist) with the aim of assessing the effectiveness of PaCT (G \ o ttken u. von Klitzing, 2014) for 4- to 10-year-olds with anxiety disorders. After treatment, over half of the children of the treatment group no longer met criteria for anxiety disorder while no children of the control group remitted during the wait-list interval. In addition, parent, child and teacher reports showed significant symptom reduction.

METHODS: The participants of this descriptive, cross-sectional study were 179 first year medical students at the Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy that completed a questionnaire assessing TPB variables, self-identity and their current oral hygiene behaviors. RESULTS: Significant differences in self-identity regarding the toothbrushing behavior and reason for the dental visit were observed (p \textless 0.0001). When participants were classified in 2 groups according to their levels of self-identity, significant differences were found according to their age, toothbrushing frequency, attitudes, perceived behavioral control and intention for improving oral hygiene (p \textless 0.0001). Self-identity had a statistically significant positive correlation with affective attitudes, cognitive attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and intention for improving oral hygiene. Hierarchical multiple regressions for toothbrushing frequency revealed that the TPB factors and self-identity explained 31 \% and 35 \% from the intention to improving behaviors, the coefficients for self-identity being significant. The structural equation model revealed the effect of self-identity on intention on improving oral health behaviors and the effect of past-behavior on self-identity. CONCLUSION: The findings revealed the value of the extended TPB model as a predictor of intention to improve oral health behaviors. Dental educators should focus on issues of students' self-identity as a person concerned by their oral health.",2013.0,,H4PKCYHU,0,cognitive,1545

E.; Hoefnagels, C.; Hosman, C. M.; Souren, P. M.; Jansen, M. W.","Exercise may have both a preventive and a therapeutic impact on mental health problems. The Exercise without Worries intervention aims to reduce stress and depressive symptoms in low-SES women by means of a group-based program combining physical exercise and psycho-education. Between September 2005 and May 2008, 161 Dutch low-SES women with elevated stress or depressive symptom levels were randomly assigned to the combined exercise/psycho-education intervention (EP), exercise only (E) or a waiting list control condition (WLC). The E condition provided low to moderate intensity stretching, strength, flexibility, and body focused training as well as relaxation, while the EP program integrated the exercise with cognitive-behavioral techniques. Depressive symptoms (CES-D) and perceived stress (PSS) were measured before and immediately after the intervention and at 2, 6 and 12 month follow-up. Multilevel linear mixed-effects models revealed no differential patterns in reduction of CES-D or PSS scores between the EP, E and WLC groups on the short (post-test and 2 month follow-up) or long term (6 and 12 months follow-up). Depressive symptom outcomes were moderated by initial depressive symptom scores: women from the EP and E groups with fewer initial symptoms benefited from participation on the short term. Further, women in the EP and E groups with the lowest educational level reported more stress reduction at post-test than women with higher educational levels. In the overall target population of low-SES women, no indications were found that the Exercise without Worries course reduced depressive symptom and stress levels on the short or long term. The findings do suggest, however, that exercise alone or in combination with psycho-education may be a viable prevention option for certain groups of disadvantaged women. Especially those low-SES women with less severe initial problems or those with low educational attainment should be targeted for future depression prevention practice.",2013.0,10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.05.015,VQ284IUN,0,behavior,1546

Methods: Patients who received therapy for intrauterine adhesion (IUA) were recruited and randomized into MBSR group and Wait‐List group (WL group). 71 women who received routine physical examination were recruited as healthy controls. Patients in MBSR group received MBSR training for 8 weeks. Results: There were 76 patients in MBSR group, 75 patients in WL group and 71 subjects in control group. When compared with control group, the scores of anxiety and depression increased significantly and the score of quality of life reduced significantly before intervention. In patients, the scores of quality of life in all the domains were negatively related to the scores of anxiety and depression (P<0.05). After MBSR for 8 weeks, there was a significant time and group interaction for the anxiety score (F=55.168, P<0.001) and depression score (F=252.485, P<0.001). The MBSR group showed a decrease in the anxiety and depression score, while the WL group did not. The quality of life (except for bodily pain) in the MBSR group was also significantly improved. The recurrence rate in the MBSR group was 18.4%, which was significantly lower than that in WL group (34.7%; P=0.024). Conclusion: IUA patients have evident anxiety and depression, which significantly reduces the life quality of patients. MBSR may improve the anxiety and depression of IUA patients during therapy, promote the post‐opera‐tive recovery and improve their quality of life. Copyright © 2017, E‐Century Publishing Corporation.

1547,Memory biases in remitted depression: the role of negative cognitions at explicit and automatic processing levels.,"Romero, Nuria; Sanchez, Alvaro; Vazquez, Carmelo","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cognitive models propose that depression is caused by dysfunctional schemas that endure beyond the depressive episode, representing vulnerability factors for recurrence. However, research testing negative cognitions linked to dysfunctional schemas in formerly depressed individuals is still scarce. Furthermore, negative cognitions are presumed to be linked to biases in recalling negative self-referent information in formerly depressed individuals, but no studies have directly tested this association. In the present study, we evaluated differences between formerly and never-depressed individuals in several experimental indices of negative cognitions and their associations with the recall of emotional self-referent material. METHODS: Formerly (n = 30) and never depressed individuals (n = 40) completed measures of explicit (i.e., scrambled sentence test) and automatic (i.e., lexical decision task) processing to evaluate negative cognitions. Furthermore participants completed a self-referent incidental recall task to evaluate memory biases. RESULTS: Formerly compared to never depressed individuals showed greater negative cognitions at both explicit and automatic levels of processing. Results also showed greater recall of negative self-referent information in formerly compared to never-depressed individuals. Finally, individual differences in negative cognitions at both explicit and automatic levels of processing predicted greater recall of negative self-referent material in formerly depressed individuals. LIMITATIONS: Analyses of the relationship between explicit and automatic processing indices and memory biases were correlational and the majority of participants in both groups were women. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence of negative cognitions in formerly depressed individuals at both automatic and explicit levels of processing that may confer a cognitive vulnerability to depression.",2014.0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2013.09.008,ATBUHBYG,0,cognitive,1548

In this study we aimed to assess the prognostic value of the presence of cognitive impairment for the conversion to multiple sclerosis in patients with clinically isolated syndromes. All patients with clinically isolated syndromes consecutively referred to our centre since 2002 and who had been followed-up for at least one year underwent cognitive assessment through the Rao's Battery and the Stroop test. Possible predictors of conversion to clinically definite multiple sclerosis were evaluated through the Kaplan Meier curves and Cox regression analysis. A total of 56 patients (41 women; age 33.2 +/- 8.5 years; expanded disability scale score 1.2 +/- 0.7) were recruited. At baseline, 32 patients (57 \% ) fulfilled McDonald's criteria for dissemination in space. During the follow-up (3.5 +/- 2.3 years), 26 patients (46 \% ) converted to a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. In particular, 64 \% of patients failing \textgreater or= 2 tests and 88 \% of patients failing \textgreater or= 3 tests converted to multiple sclerosis. In the Cox regression model, the failure of at least three tests (HR 3.3; 95 \% CI 1.4-8.1; p = 0.003) and the presence of McDonald's dissemination in space at baseline (HR 3.8; 95 \% CI 1.5-9.7; p = 0.005), were found to be predictors for conversion to multiple sclerosis. We conclude that cognitive impairment is detectable in a sizable proportion of patients with clinically isolated syndromes. In these subjects cognitive impairment has a prognostic value in predicting conversion to multiple sclerosis and may therefore play a role in therapeutic decision making.",2010.0,10.1177/1352458509350311,EM76GMR2,0,cognitive,1549

There are many factors which may hinder the development of prenatal attachment, including the presence of complications, hospitalisation, and anxiety. However, women's appraisals of risk may not be congruent with medical assessments of risk. The current study sought to model the relationships between risk (maternal perceptions and medical ratings), coping, psychological well-being, and maternal-foetal attachment among 87 women hospitalised for pregnancy-related complications. Analysis indicated that positive appraisal as a coping strategy mediates the relationship between maternal appraisals of risk and maternal-foetal attachment, and that medical ratings of risk were not predictive of maternal-foetal attachment. Awareness of the potential incongruence between patients' and health professionals' perceptions of risk is important within the clinical environment. The potential benefits of promoting positive appraisal in high-risk pregnancy merit further research.",2008.0,10.1080/02646830801918455,BLKRTEC6,0,cognitive_additional,1550

1551,Incidental diagnosis of wilson's disease: A case report,"Aleem, A.; Khan, J.; Bloomfield, C.","Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism caused by complete absence or dysfunction of a copper transporting enzyme which is a transmembrane protein ATPase (ATP7B) encoded on chromosome 13. The incidence of this condition is seen in 1 in 30 000 individuals. The presentation of WD is variable and usually involves the hepatic and neuropsychiatric systems with symptoms ranging from chronic liver disease, compensated or decompensated cirrhosis, fulminant liver failure, dystonia, choreiform movements, tremor, gait disturbances, personality changes and cognitive impairments which are attributed to copper accumulation. We present a case where routine imaging for a persistent problem considered to be chronic pelvic pain led to the diagnosis of WD. A 28-year-old female with history of longstanding depression and Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus was admitted with recurrent abdominopelvic pain. She had been hospitalized multiple times for evaluation of recurrent abdominopelvic pain. Her initial episode of abdominopelvic pain was evaluated with a CT Abdomen that showed a pelvic abscess which was managed surgically with complete resolution and since then, she has had extensive evaluation including serial imaging during subsequent hospitalizations which were negative for any acute process. During this admission, a repeat CT Abdomen showed new onset cirrhosis of the liver which was absent on previous imaging studies. Patient denied alcohol use and after a negative infectious, autoimmune and hematological workup, further laboratory evaluation showed low serum levels of ceruloplasmin (5.4 mg/dl) and an elevated 24 hour urine copper excretion (302 ug/d). Slit light examination of the eyes was negative for Kayser-Fleisher rings. MRI Brain showed T2 high signal intensity in the pons. She was empirically started on zinc gluconate. Genetic testing showed heterozygous mutation in the gene ATP7B and a diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made. Patient continues to be maintained on zinc therapy and is closely being followed as an outpatient for liver transplant evaluation. The diagnosis of WD can be easily missed and if diagnosed early could potentially prevent or reverse many of its serious manifestations. Despite the involvement of the hepatic and neurological system on imaging, our patient was completely asymptomatic which makes this case unique. Our case further reiterates the importance of always keeping WD on the differential in evaluating patients with cirrhosis. (Figure Presented).",2017.0,10.1038/ajg.2017.351,5KW8FX29,0,additional,1552

To study the frequency of this association and to determine whether patients with simultaneous panic and major depression differed from those with only major depressive disorder (MDD) in clinical features and in sleep electroencephalographic (EEG) variables, we evaluated a total sample of 336 patients with MDD. Fifty-eight (17 \% ) had both panic and MDD; 50 had complete data and were matched for age and severity of illness with other patients having only MDD. Patients with simultaneous panic and depression had significantly higher ratings for psychic and somatic anxiety, and rapid eye movement (REM) latencies approximating normal values. Patients with only MDD (without panic disorder) rated significantly higher in guilt feelings and had shorter REM latencies.

These concerned career prospects, early retirement, subjective assessment of overwork, frequency of illness, negative work conditions, job satisfaction, readiness to be retrained for a suitable job, relations with superiors and co-workers, positive expectations of medical treatment, various symptoms from the vegetative and somatic fields, and symptoms of depression and introversion. The information showed the control group to be most significantly different by a lower readiness for conflict and circumstances less characterized by conflict.

1556,Alterations in stress reactivity after long-term treatment with paroxetine in women with posttraumatic stress disorder.,"E, Vermetten; M, Vythilingam; C, Schmahl; C, Kloet; Sm, Southwick; Ds, Charney; Jd, Bremner","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is typically accompanied by both acute and chronic alterations in the stress response. These alterations have mostly been described in individuals under baseline conditions, but studies have also used a challenge model to assess the role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in the stress response. The purpose of this article was to assess the effect of long-term treatment with the selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), paroxetine, on stress reactivity in patients with PTSD. We assessed diurnal salivary cortisol and urinary cortisol as well as cortisol, heart rate, and behavioral responses to a standardized cognitive stress challenge, in 13 female patients with chronic PTSD before and after 12 months of paroxetine treatment. Treatment resulted in a significant decrease in PTSD symptoms. Twenty-four-hour urinary cortisol was lower compared to base line after successful treatment. Treatment resulted in a decrease of salivary cortisol levels on all time points on a diurnal curve. Despite similar stress perception, cortisol response to the cognitive stress challenge resulted in a 26.5% relative decrease in stress-induced salivary cortisol with treatment. These results suggest that successful treatment with SSRI in chronic PTSD is associated with a trend for a decrease in baseline diurnal cortisol and with reduced cortisol reactivity to stress.",2006.0,10.1196/annals.1364.014,L8QH3C8R,0,diathesis,1557

M.; Mondelli, V.; Nikkheslat, N.; Lopizzo, N.; Riva, M. A.; Russell, A.; Hotopf, M.; Pariante, C. M.","Owing to the unique opportunity to assess individuals before and after they develop depression within a short timeframe, interferon-$\alpha$ (IFN-$\alpha$) treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is an ideal model to identify molecular mechanisms relevant to major depression, especially in the context of enhanced inflammation. Fifty-eight patients were assessed prospectively, at baseline and monthly over 24 weeks of IFN-$\alpha$ treatment. New-onset cases of depression were determined using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Whole-blood transcriptomic analyses were conducted to investigate the following: (1) baseline gene expression differences associated with future development of IFN-$\alpha$-induced depression, before IFN-$\alpha$, and (2) longitudinal gene expression changes from baseline to weeks 4 or 24 of IFN-$\alpha$ treatment, separately in those who did and did not develop depression. Transcriptomics data were analyzed using Partek Genomics Suite (1.4-fold, FDR adjusted p≤0.05) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Software. Twenty patients (34 \% ) developed IFN-$\alpha$-induced depression. At baseline, 73 genes were differentially expressed in patients who later developed depression compared with those who did not. After 4 weeks of IFN-$\alpha$ treatment, 592 genes were modulated in the whole sample, representing primarily IFN-$\alpha$-responsive genes. Substantially more genes were modulated only in patients who developed depression (n=506, compared with n=70 in patients who did not), with enrichment in inflammation-, neuroplasticity- and oxidative stress-related pathways. A similar picture was observed at week 24. Our data indicate that patients who develop IFN-$\alpha$-induced depression have an increased biological sensitivity to IFN-$\alpha$, as shown by larger gene expression changes, and specific signatures both as predictors and as correlates.",2016.0,10.1038/npp.2016.50,A9FLKBPA,0,diathesis,1558
1558,Cognitively-Based Compassion Training for Breast Cancer Survivors,Nct,"There is a growing number of evidence of how mindfulness training enhances psychological and physical well‐being and coping strategies in patients with oncological illnesses. However, there are very few studies analyzing the efficacy of Compassion‐Based Interventions on breast cancer survivors. The goal of this study is to analyze enrollment, participant satisfaction and adherence to program and differences in psychological well‐being, health related quality of life, fear of illness recurrence, compassion and self‐compassion variables after a Compassion‐Based Intervention in a Spanish breast cancer survivor sample. This study is a randomized clinical trial of a secularized intervention called Cognitively‐Based Compassion Training (CBCT). Subjects (n = 58) were randomly assigned to CBCT (n = 28) or a treatment as usual control group (TAU) (n = 28). Participants in the CBCT intervention condition were asked to meet weekly for a two (2) hour long session during two months. Pre‐post‐intervention and six month follow‐up measures took place to evaluate: psychological well‐being (somatic, depressive, and anxious symptomatology), health related quality of life (physical, social, emotional, and functional); psychological stress, coping strategies and triggering cognitions linked to cancer recurrence fear, self‐compassion, compassion and mindfulness and awareness in both intervention and wait list groups.

1559,Relational perspectives and the supervisory triad,"McKinney, M.","Contemporary psychoanalytic perspectives, especially those broadly labeled relational, have significant implications for how supervision is understood and conducted. Perspectivist, 2-person models of psychoanalysis may be applied to the ways supervisors construct supervisory authority, knowledge, and the transmission of clinical technique to the trainee. Specifically, a dyadic model of psychoanalysis leads to a triadic view of the supervisory process. Clinical examples are used to expand traditional concepts of parallel process and illustrate ways in which supervisor, therapist, and patient are engaged in an inevitable and ongoing system of multidirectional influence. Relational concepts - such as the value of paradox and uncertainty, the interaction between mutuality and asymmetry, locating a balance between old and new object relationships, and attending to reciprocal influences in affective shiftsare highlighted as they apply to the supervisory triad. In an article about how theory shapes psychoanalytic technique, William Grossman (1995) reported a brief anecdote about the supervision of an analytic case: A candidate ... was about to interpret a fantasy to a patient. As she was about to speak, the image of the supervisor came to mind, shaking his head in disapproval. The student refrained from saying anything. She was then chagrined when during the next supervisory hour the supervisor suggested the same interpretation. 'I was going to make that interpretation' said the student. 'Why didn't you?' said the supervisor. 'You told me not to' was the witty answer. (Grossman, 1995, p. 894).",2000.0,10/fhmr5f,6CQUXHU8,0,psychodynamic,1560

The authors of a recent meta-analysis showed that this association is statistically significant (Hedges's g = 0.35) but warned that estimates might be distorted because of publication bias. Here, we report a replication study of this relationship in 120 participants. We failed to find an association of 5-HTTLPR variation with amygdala activation during a widely used emotional-face-matching paradigm. Moreover, when we conducted a meta-analysis that included unpublished studies and data from the current study, the pooled meta-analytic effect size was no longer significant (g = 0.20, p = .06). These findings cast doubt on previously reported substantial effects, suggesting that the 5-HTTLPR-amygdala association is either much smaller than previously thought, conditional on other factors, or nonexistent.",2014.0,10.1177/0956797614548877,H6XXFC8X,0,cognitive_additional,1561

The present study is an attempt to statistically disentangle the two constructs and to evaluate their differential correlates. A common factor analysis of the items in a depression and an anxiety inventory was conducted using data collected from two samples-208 college students and eighty-seven 18-years-old participating in the Block Longitudinal Study. In both samples two factors, interpreted as depressive tendencies and susceptibility to anxiety, were found; the factor loadings on each factor were highly correlated across the two samples. No sex differences were found in these factor structures. Factor-based scores comprised of well-differentiating items were computed for participants in the Block sample. Using partial correlation analyses, observer-measured as well as self-report-based personality correlates of the specific variance associated with depressive tendencies and with susceptibility to anxiety, respectively, were contrasted.

However, the role of conformity to masculine norms on help-seeking attitudes for noncollege-age men or for men from diverse backgrounds is not well understood. To fill this gap in the literature, the present study examined the cross-cultural relevance of a mediational model of the relationships between conformity to dominant U.S. masculine norms and attitudes toward counseling through the mediator of self-stigma of seeking counseling for 4,773 men from both majority and nonmajority populations (race/ethnicity and sexual orientation). Structural equation modeling results showed that the model established using college males from majority groups (European American, heterosexual) may be applicable to a community sample of males from differing racial/ethnic groups and sexual orientations. However, some important differences in the presence and strengths of the relationships between conformity to dominant masculine norms and the other variables in the model were present across different racial/ethnic groups and sexual orientations. These findings suggest the need to pay specific theoretical and clinical attention to how conformity to dominant masculine norms and self-stigma are linked to unfavorable attitudes toward help seeking for these men, in order to encourage underserved men's help-seeking behavior.",2011.0,10.1037/a0023688,3C8URJZ8,0,cognitive,1564

Our objectives were to examine the association between NAFLD and QOL as well as other psychosocial outcomes, to compare psychosocial outcomes to obese children without known NAFLD, and to determine whether present standard care for NAFLD results in weight loss and improvement in psychosocial outcomes longitudinally. METHODS: Children with NAFLD between 8 and 18 years and obese control children without known NAFLD were consented to complete a brief psychosocial battery examining depression (Children's Depression Inventory), QOL (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory; PedsQL), and effect of weight on self-esteem (Body-Esteem Scale for Adolescents and Adults) at baseline; and additionally for the NAFLD group after at least 6 months. RESULTS: A total of 48 children with NAFLD and 40 obese control children were enrolled. The PedsQL scores were not significantly different but the CDI total score and subscales of negative mood, ineffectiveness, and negative self-esteem as well as all of the 3 subscales of BESAA, appearance, attribution, and weight were worse in the NAFLD group compared with obese controls. The PedsQL scores also did not change after standard care in the 33 patients with NAFLD who completed the follow-up evaluations, but the CDI score differed between those whose body mass index improved or not. CONCLUSIONS: Children with NAFLD have higher levels of depression than obese controls. Outcomes did not improve with standard care.

Although women still smoke less than men do, smoking among women is on the increase, especially in younger women and teenagers. Reduction of cardiovascular risk through smoking cessation while maintaining weight is a major goal of intervention. The purpose of this article is to discuss best care practices for women with tobacco addiction using a 3-point integration of clinical expertise, the best available evidence gained from systematic research, and an analysis of satisfaction with care data. A model for a smoking cessation intervention with weight management content is presented using a conceptual framework of social learning theory, self-efficacy judgments, and the 4 principal sources of self-efficacy information. The specific aims of this pilot study are to (1) test the feasibility of the study methods and procedures, including subject accrual, attrition, and reliability of the instruments and protocol; (2) explore utilization of and satisfaction with the intervention; and (3) describe the impact of the intervention on primary (smoking biomarker) and secondary (weight/body mass index, depression, partner support, and smoking cessation self-efficacy temptations) outcomes. Results show that the study is feasible, but modifications are needed to improve utilization and satisfaction with care. The primary outcome showed a reduction in the smoking biomarker while maintaining weight at the 2-month follow-up. There was also improvement in skills to manage temptation situations that supported the conceptual framework.

1567,Duloxetine in the treatment of depression: an overview.,"Monteleone, Francesco; Caputo, Mariella; Tecce, Mario Felice; Capasso, Anna","Depression is a disorder that can be classified in the categories of non-organic psychiatric disorders and mood disorders. Mood tone is an important psychic function involved in the adaptation to both our internal and external world. It is flexible, that is, it goes up when we are in positive and favorable conditions, but it goes down when we are in negative and unpleasant states. We can define depression as a condition when mood tone loses its flexibility, it goes down and it's no longer influenced by favorable external events. In fact, depression is characterized by changes in the way how the affected individual thinks, feels and acts. Even if this change occurs gradually, a depressed subject is not the same as before. For example, a brilliant student could be persuaded to be not able to finish his studies; an affectionate mother could start to neglect her sons; an enterprising worker could lose every interest for his activity. Moreover, a depressed person doesn't care of his aspect or of himself. The surviving instinct could leave place to the desire to stop his own life. The most evident characteristic of depression in the adulthood is a sad mood, a gloomy solitary and apathetic attitude. A depressed subject could cry also with no apparent reason, he could have difficulty falling asleep or he could wake up very early in the morning and no longer returns to sleep. Or, instead, he could sleep more than usually and he could feel tired persistently. He could lose appetite and weight, or, in some cases, he could eat much more than usually and he could gain weight. Typically, a depressed person feels himself in a extremely negative way, he could think to be hopeless and helpless and he often condemns himself for small guilty. A depressed subject is pessimistic about himself and his own future; he loses interest in all what happens around him and he gets no satisfaction from the activities that before were pleasant. Some persons can be depressed also if they don't show evident signs of depression, but they complain for physical symptoms or they abuse of alcohol or other substances. It has been estimated that in the industrialized Western world one to six persons has a depressive episode at least once during his life; at present, the incidence of depression in the general population is around 5 \% with clear cut prevalence in the female sex. This leads to high social costs: behind the short-term inability, we have to consider also the long term inability (it has been estimated that, in 2020, depression will represent the second most frequent cause of permanent inability) as well as the suicide risk, the proved major susceptibility of depressed subjects to various non-psychiatric pathologies and the increased rate of premature deaths of depressed individuals as compared to the general population. The present work not only evaluates the drugs used for the treatment of depression, but it focuses also on those studies that investigated the efficacy of a second generation drug: Duloxetine that has a higher selectivity of action and a better tolerability profile as compared to first generation medications. These characteristics make Duloxetine the most effective therapeutic choice to improve both psychological and somatic symptoms of depression in order to get higher rates of symptomatic remission on depressive episodes.",2011.0,,78VZEUND,0,cognitive,1568

Mothers, fathers, primary teachers, and secondary teachers rated SCT, ADHD-IN, ADHD-hyperactivity/impulsivity (HI), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), anxiety, depression, academic impairment, social impairment, and peer rejection dimensions for 585 Spanish 3rd-grade children (53% boys). Within-setting (i.e., mothers, fathers; primary, secondary teachers) and cross-settings (i.e., home, school) invariance was found for both SCT and ADHD-IN. From home to school, higher levels of home SCT predicted lower levels of school ADHD-HI and higher levels of school academic impairment after controlling for home ADHD-IN, whereas higher levels of home ADHD-IN predicted higher levels of school ADHD-HI, ODD, anxiety, depression, academic impairment, and peer rejection after controlling for home SCT. From school to home, higher levels of school SCT predicted lower levels of home ADHD-HI and ODD and higher levels of home anxiety, depression, academic impairment, and social impairment after controlling for school ADHD-IN, whereas higher levels of school ADHD-IN predicted higher levels of home ADHD-HI, ODD, and academic impairment after controlling for school SCT. Although SCT at home and school was able to uniquely predict symptom and impairment dimensions in the other setting, SCT at school was a better predictor than ADHD-IN at school of psychopathology and impairment at home.

However, little evidence from well-controlled longitudinal studies exists on these consequences. The aim of this study was to determine whether use of meth/amphetamine (speed) and +/-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) is independently predictive of subsequent depressive symptoms in adolescents. METHODS: A sample of 3880 adolescents from secondary schools in disadvantaged areas of Quebec, Canada, were followed over time (2003-2008). Logistic regression was used to test the association between meth/amphetamine and MDMA use in grade 10 (ages 15-16 years) and elevated depressive symptoms on an abridged Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale in grade 11, controlling for pre-existing individual and contextual characteristics. RESULTS: After adjustment, both MDMA use (OR 1.7, 95 \% CI 1.1 to 2.6) and meth/amphetamine use (OR 1.6, 95 \% CI 1.1 to 2.3) in grade 10 significantly increased the odds of elevated depressive symptoms in grade 11. These relationships did not vary by gender or pre-existing depressive symptoms. Increased risk was particularly observed in concurrent usage (OR 1.9, 95 \% CI 1.2 to 2.9). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent use of meth/amphetamine and MDMA (particularly concurrent use) is independently associated with subsequent depressive symptoms. Further enquiry must determine whether these associations reflect drug-induced neurotoxicity and whether adolescence is a period of increased vulnerability to the hazards of synthetic drug exposure.",2012.0,10.1136/jech-2011-200706,XU2I9W5S,0,cognitive_additional,1570

Regarding the anti-DNP response, low density conjugates were immunogenic but not tolerogenic (even at high doses), higher conjugates were both, depending on concentration, while very high density conjugates were only tolerogenic. These results confirm and extend earlier findings made with DNP conjugates of polymeric flagellin and indicate the probable generality of this principle. Together with parallel in vivo studies (Eur.

L.","Rorschach data were used to psychometrically map the internal psychological operations of three Cluster B personality disorders, listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd ed., rev. [DSM-III-R]; American Psychiatric Association, 1987), all of which may be organized at a borderline level. Psychopathic antisocial subjects (P-APDs) and narcissistic subjects (NPDs) were highly narcissistic. NPD subjects, however, produced more indices of anxiety and attachment capacity and fewer scores related to borderline object relations and damaged identity. P-APDs and borderline subjects (BPDs) produced similar mean numbers of borderline object relations; however, the BPDs were more anxious, produced more unsublimated aggressive and libidinal drive material, and evidenced greater potential for attachment. BPDs were also less narcissistic than both P-APDs and NPDs. Nonpsychopathic antisocial subjects (NP-APDs) were less borderline than P-APDs and BPDs, less narcissistic in terms of a stable grandiose self-structure than NPD and P-APDs, produced less evidence of attachment capacity than NPDs and BPDs but more than P-APDs, and were similar to BPDs in their proneness to anxiety. The outpatient NPDs and BPDs produced more idealization responses than the incarcerated antisocial personality disorder (APD) groups. We conclude that the behavioral descriptions offered for these three Cluster B personality disorders, when used in conjunction with information such as level of personality organization (Kernberg, 1984), level of psychopathy (Hare, 1980, 1985), and outpatient versus inpatient research settings, may have greater intrapsychic specificity than previously thought.",1992.0,10/cj65j7,ZXCTWNP9,0,psychodynamic,1572

B.; Veit, R.; Malekshahi, R.; Kircher, T.; Birbaumer, N.; Sitaram, R.; Ruiz, S.","Introduction Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common and chronic condition that can have disabling effects throughout the patient's lifespan. Frequent symptoms among OCD patients include fear of contamination and washing compulsions. Several studies have shown a link between contamination fears, disgust over-reactivity, and insula activation in OCD. In concordance with the role of insula in disgust processing, new neural models based on neuroimaging studies suggest that abnormally high activations of insula could be implicated in OCD psychopathology, at least in the subgroup of patients with contamination fears and washing compulsions. Methods In the current study, we used a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) based on real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) to aid OCD patients to achieve down-regulation of the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal in anterior insula. Our first aim was to investigate whether patients with contamination obsessions and washing compulsions can learn to volitionally decrease (down-regulate) activity in the insula in the presence of disgust/anxiety provoking stimuli. Our second aim was to evaluate the effect of down-regulation on clinical, behavioural and physiological changes pertaining to OCD symptoms. Hence, several pre- and post-training measures were performed, i.e., confronting the patient with a disgust/anxiety inducing real-world object (Ecological Disgust Test), and subjective rating and physiological responses (heart rate, skin conductance level) of disgust towards provoking pictures. Results Results of this pilot study, performed in 3 patients (2 females), show that OCD patients can gain self-control of the BOLD activity of insula, albeit to different degrees. In two patients positive changes in behaviour in the EDT were observed following the rtfMRI trainings. Behavioural changes were also confirmed by reductions in the negative valence and in the subjective perception of disgust towards symptom provoking images. Conclusion Although preliminary, results of this study confirmed that insula down-regulation is possible in patients suffering from OCD, and that volitional decreases of insula activation could be used for symptom alleviation in this disorder.

1576,Stress and coping in children and adolescents with fibromyalgia.,"Libby, Christopher J.","Children and adolescents suffering from Juvenile Primary Fibromyalgia Syndrome (JPFS) are at an increased risk for a number of difficulties in psychological, social, and academic functioning. Identifying coping strategies that improve a child's ability to deal with stressful events and minimize functional disability and pain in JPFS is potentially important for the development of successful interventions. The main hypotheses of this investigation were that adaptive coping strategies, perceived social support, and self-efficacy would moderate the relationship between stressors and scores on each of three outcome variables. These three outcome variables were quality of life, depressive symptoms, and pain ratings. Furthermore, stressful life events and daily hassles scores were expected to be negatively correlated with quality of life scores and positively correlated with pain ratings. The participants for this study were 57 children and adolescents with JPFS, who were between the ages of 10 and 18 years, and their parents. Participants were recruited primarily from the rheumatology clinics at two large children's hospitals. The measures filled out by the child/adolescent included pain ratings on a Visual Analog Scale (Pain VAS), the Coping Strategies Questionnaire-Child Version (CSQ-C), the Children's Depression Inventory-Short Form (CDI-S), the Children's Hassles Scale (CHS), the Perceived Support from Family and Friends Scale (PSS), the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), and a modified Children's Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale (CASE). Parents completed the Coddington Life Events Scale (CLES-A), a parent-rating PedsQL, and a demographics form. As predicted by a stress and coping model, daily hassles stress predicted the outcome measures of depression score and child-rated quality of life. This result showed that stress may exacerbate health outcomes in JPFS. As expected, self-efficacy moderated the relationship between daily hassles and depression. Catastrophic thinking and selfefficacy predicted child-rated quality of life, and self-efficacy predicted ratings of the worst pain in the past week. This study provided support for applying a stress and coping model to children and adolescents with JPFS.

Bright IDEAS, a problem-solving skills training (PSST) intervention, has been shown to decrease negative affectivity (anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress symptoms) in mothers of newly diagnosed patients. This study was designed to determine the specificity of PSST by examining its direct and indirect (eg, social support) effects compared with a nondirective support (NDS) intervention. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomized clinical trial included 309 English- or Spanish-speaking mothers of children diagnosed 2 to 16 weeks before recruitment. Participants completed assessments prerandomization (T1), immediately postintervention (T2), and at 3-month follow-up (T3). Both PSST and NDS consisted of eight weekly 1-hour individual sessions. Outcomes included measures of problem-solving skill and negative affectivity. RESULTS: There were no significant between-group differences at baseline (T1). Except for level of problem-solving skill, which was directly taught in the PSST arm, outcome measures improved equally in both groups immediately postintervention (T2). However, at the 3-month follow-up (T3), mothers in the PSST group continued to show significant improvements in mood, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress; mothers in the NDS group showed no further significant gains. CONCLUSION: PSST is an effective and specific intervention whose beneficial effects continue to grow after the intervention ends. In contrast, NDS is an effective intervention while it is being administered, but its benefits plateau when active support is removed. Therefore, teaching coping skills at diagnosis has the potential to facilitate family resilience over the entire course of treatment.",2013.0,10.1200/JCO.2011.39.1870,LKCK5D3H,0,behavior,1579
1579,Relationship between FKBP5 polymorphisms and depression symptoms among kidney transplant recipients,"Shinozaki, G.; Jowsey, S.; Amer, H.; Biernacka, J. M.; Colby, C.; Walker, D.; Black, J.; Rundell, J.; Stegall, M.; Mrazek, D. A.","Background: Several polymorphisms in FK506 Binding Protein gene (FKBP5) and a history of child abuse have been shown to be associated with an increased risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It has also been demonstrated that the same polymorphisms of FKBP5 are associated with increased recurrence of depressive episodes and rapid response to antidepressant treatment. However, there are only limited numbers of studies replicating the polymorphisms as vulnerability factors for the development of mental illnesses, such as PTSD and depression after stressful life event, especially with a specific incidence, such as kidney transplant surgery. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted using the electronic medical records of 131 adult kidney transplant recipients. Depression severity after kidney transplantation was measured by PHQ-9, and stored blood was genotyped for variants in the Serotonin Transporter (SLC6A4), Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, Catecholamine-O-Methyltransferase, Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor, and FKBP5 genes. Spearman correlations were used to test for association between genetic variants and depression severity. Results: The rare alleles at three out of four SNPs in FKBP5 (rs1360780, rs9296158, and rs9470080) were associated with increased PHQ-9 scores (P \textless .05), whereas the last FKBP5 SNP (rs3800373) showed a trend of association (P \textless .10). All four FKBP5 SNPs are in strong linkage disequilibrium. Although in a subgroup of Caucasian non-Hispanic subjects the association was not statistically significant, the direction of association was consistent with that observed in the entire sample as well as in previous studies. Polymorphisms in genes other than FKBP5 were not associated with PHQ-9 scores. Conclusions: Polymorphisms in FKBP5 may be associated with higher depression scores in kidney transplant recipients. \textcopyright 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2011.0,10.1002/da.20879,S7N5G359,0,diathesis,1580
1580,A community-based approach to preventing youth violence: what can we learn from the playground?,"Drabick, D. A.; Baugh, D.","Aggression, bullying, and victimization represent tremendous public health concerns among youth. These behaviors occur frequently in unstructured settings, such as the playground. Direct observations of the playground permit examination of these peer processes and are readily accomplished using community-based participatory research (CBPR). To present alternative viewpoints regarding the use of playground observations to evaluate peer aggression, bullying, and victimization. We used a (1) child-specific observational coding system and (2) naturalistic observation of the playground to examine playground behaviors. Peer-child processes have differential associations with conduct disorder (CD) and depression symptoms. Group-based observations suggested a number of strengths and some areas that would be amenable to intervention. A CBPR framework is useful for identifying youth involved in bullying and victimization; providing immediate support, interventions, and problem-solving strategies; and predicting potential negative outcomes, which can inform violence prevention and intervention efforts.",2010.0,,VXCH2V7G,0,behavior,1581

L.","MMPI (Form R) profiles of psychiatric inpatients (N=45) meeting DSM-III criteria for borderline personality disorder were compared with chronic schizophrenic inpatients (N=48) and with inpatients with acute psychotic illness (N=20). Profile shape was similar among the three groups, although the borderline sample showed significantly higher elevations on four of the 10 clinical scales - Depression, Hysteria, Psychopathic Deviate, and Psychasthenia - when compared to the chronic schizophrenic cohorts. The borderline sample showed only one significant deviation on the clinical scales when compared to the acute psychotic sample as evidenced by a higher elevation on the Psychopathic Deviate scale. Clinically, the borderline MMPI responses suggest features of irritability, hostility and resentfulness. On the validity scales, the borderline sample showed a significantly lower score on the L scale when compared to both comparison groups, although all of the groups' L scale scores were within conventional limits. While significant differences between groups did not emerge on the F scale, the borderline sample attained a clinically elevated score suggestive of weakened ego defenses and unconventional thinking. Analysis was also performed of a composite measure of psychoticism probability (the Goldberg Index) between groups. While the borderline and acute psychotic samples showed Goldberg indices suggestive of increasing likelihood for psychotic illness, the chronic schizophrenic group yielded a Goldberg Index significantly greater than both of the other groups, thus confirming the validity of the hypothesis. Finally, the MMPI borderline profiles were also compared to previously published norms of borderline outpatients and veteran borderline inpatients. Results of these analyses yielded several significant scale differences. Clinical impressions from these group differences suggest that veteran borderline inpatients are more likely to present psychotic-like symptoms while outpatient borderline MMPI responses suggest significantly fewer psychotic symptoms when compared to their inpatient peers. Implications of these findings are discussed.",1984.0,,IVF68LBM,0,personality,1582
1582,Resting state low-frequency fluctuations in prefrontal cortex reflect degrees of harm avoidance and novelty seeking: An exploratory NIRS study,"Nakao, T.; Matsumoto, T.; Shimizu, D.; Morita, M.; Yoshimura, S.; Northoff, G.; Morinobu, S.; Okamoto, Y.; Yamawaki, S.","Harm avoidance (HA) and novelty seeking (NS) are temperament dimensions defined by Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), respectively, reflecting a heritable bias for intense response to aversive stimuli or for excitement in response to novel stimuli. High HA is regarded as a risk factor for major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder. In contrast, higher NS is linked to increased risk for substance abuse and pathological gambling disorder. A growing body of evidence suggests that patients with these disorders show abnormality in the power of slow oscillations of resting-state brain activity. It is particularly interesting that previous studies have demonstrated that resting state activities in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) are associated with HA or NS scores, although the relation between the power of resting state slow oscillations and these temperament dimensions remains poorly elucidated. This preliminary study investigated the biological bases of these temperament traits by particularly addressing the resting state low-frequency fluctuations in MPFC. Regional hemodynamic changes in channels covering MPFC during 5-min resting states were measured from 22 healthy participants using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). These data were used for correlation analyses. Results show that the power of slow oscillations during resting state around the dorsal part of MPFC is negatively correlated with the HA score. In contrast, NS was positively correlated with the power of resting state slow oscillations around the ventral part of MPFC. These results suggest that the powers of slow oscillation at rest in dorsal or ventral MPFC, respectively, reflect the degrees of HA and NS. This exploratory study therefore uncovers novel neural bases of HA and NS. We discuss a neural mechanism underlying aversion-related and reward-related processing based on results obtained from this study. \ \textcopyright \ 2013 Nakao, Matsumoto, Shimizu, Morita, Yoshimura, Northoff, Morinobu, Okamoto and Yamawaki.",2013.0,,WNY4ZHVR,0,personality,1583

This commentary addresses a number of issues concerning the extension of self-efficacy theory to memory functioning. These include the following: the multidimensionality and measurement of perceived memory capabilities; the veridicality of memory self-appraisal; the efficacious exercise of personal control over memory functioning; the psychosocial processes by which people preserve a favorable sense of memory self-efficacy over the life span; and strategies for generalizing the impact of training in memory skills.

1584,Learning from Positive and Negative Monetary Feedback in Patients with Alcohol Dependence,"Rustemeier, M.; Rmling, J.; Czybulka, C.; Reymann, G.; Daum, I.; Bellebaum, C.","Background: Chronic and excessive consumption of alcohol is associated with structural, physiological, and functional changes in multiple regions of the human brain including the prefrontal cortex, the medial temporal lobe, and the structures of the reward system. The present study aimed to assess the ability of alcohol-dependent patients (ADP) to learn probabilistic stimulus-reward contingencies and to transfer the acquired knowledge to new contexts. During transfer, the relative preference to learn from positive or negative feedback was also assessed. Methods: Twenty-four recently detoxified ADP and 20 healthy controls engaged in a feedback learning task with monetary rewards. The learning performance per se and transfer performance including positive versus negative learning were examined, as well as the relationship between different learning variables and variables comprising alcohol and nicotine consumption patterns, depression, and personality traits (harm avoidance and impulsivity). Results: Patients did not show a significant general learning deficit in the acquisition of stimulus-response-outcome associations. Fifteen healthy subjects and 13 patients reached the transfer phase, in which ADP showed generally lower performance than healthy controls. There was no specific deficit with regard to learning from positive or negative feedback. The only near-significant (negative) correlation between learning variables and drug consumption patterns, depression, and personality traits emerged for harm avoidance and positive learning in controls. Conclusions: Impaired transfer performance suggests that ADP had problems applying their acquired knowledge in a new context. Potential relations to dysfunctions of specific brain structures and implications of the finding for therapy are discussed. \ \textcopyright \ 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.",2012.0,,RG3PSDEQ,0,personality,1585

Freud first recognized the relationship between emotional reactions to significant loss and depression and posited that major depression (melancholia) is due to aggression turned against the self. R. Butler (1982) suggests that a life review of unresolved conflict and loss is important in the treatment of depression. E. Bibring (1961) associated depression with real or perceived helplessness and its accompanying loss of self-esteem. A. Beck's (1967) cognitive model suggests that depression is related to negative perceptions of the self-environment interaction, the self, and/or the future. Each of these models has implications for the treatment of depression in the elderly. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",,10/fh82hn,UN6PV7UB,0,psychodynamic,1587
1587,Lurasidone for the treatment of major depressive disorder with mixed features: do manic symptoms moderate treatment response?,"Pikalov, A.; Goldberg, J.; Siu, C.; Mao, Y.; Tsai, J.; Loebel, A.","Introduction: Manic symptoms below the threshold for hypo‐mania (mixed features) are common in individuals with major depressive disorder. This form of depression is of ten severe and associated with an increased risk for recurrence, suicide attempts, substance abuse, and functional disability. This post‐hoc analysis evaluated whether the efficacy of lurasidone in major depressive disorder (MDD) with mixed features is moderated by the number and characteristics of manic symptoms present at study baseline. Methods: Patients meeting DSM‐IV‐TR criteria for MDD who presented with two or three manic symptoms (consistent with the DSM‐5 mixed features specifier) were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of double‐blind treatment with either lurasidone 20‐60 mg/d (N=109) or placebo (N=100). Three non‐specific mood symptoms (irritability, distractibility and aggressive behavior) were treated as manic symptoms for the purpose of this analysis; these were examined together with the seven DSM‐5 specified manic symptoms. Finite mixture models were applied to identify latent class patterns of these 10 baseline manic symptoms. Results: Three latent class profiles were identified: 105 (50.5%) patients had manic symptom prof ile 1 (MIX 1) with mean MADRS 33.0, mean YMRS 9.2, mean number of manic symptoms 3.8; 63 (30.3%) patients had manic symptom prof ile 2 (MIX 2) with similar MADRS (32.4) and YMRS (9.3) and number of manic symptoms 3.5; 40 patients had manic symptom prof ile 3 (MIX 3) with significantly higher severity in MADRS (35) and YMRS (14.9) and number of manic symptoms 4.6. The largest treatment effect size for improvement in YMRS score was observed in latent class (MIX 3) which had both the highest number of manic symptoms and highest overall YMRS score at study baseline. Significant moderating effects on change in YMRS score were observed for the ""decreased need for sleep"" symptom and the mixed feature latent class, with greater lurasidone effect sizes (vs. placebo) found in MIX 3 subgroup and patients without the sleep symptom (p < 0.05). The network analysis suggests that the manic symptoms ""elevated mood"" (YMRS item 1) and/or ""increased motor activity energy"" (YMRS item 2), which are both linked to ""sleep"" symptoms (overlapping bridge symptoms in mania and depression), are pivotal in the network structure of MDD with mixed features and may function as cardinal symptoms that can influence overall treatment response. Conclusions: In this post‐hoc analysis of a placebo‐controlled trial involving MDD patients with mixed features, certain manic symptoms were found to be significantly associated with improvement in manic and depressive symptoms and to moderate the treatment effect on treatment outcomes. Our findings suggest that baseline mixed feature profiles based on the number, nature, and severity of manic symptoms can have moderator effects on treatment outcomes. Further research is needed to confirm the impact of specific symptoms on treatment outcome in patients with major depressive disorder with mixed features.",2017.0,,UWMLIQ38,0,additional,1588

Methods: This cross-sectional study included 195 participants with an enucleated eye who were attending an ophthalmic clinic for prosthetic rehabilitation between July and November 2014. Demographic and clinical data, and self-reported feelings of shame, sadness and anger were collected. Participants also completed the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire, the Facial Appearance subscale of the Negative Physical Self Scale, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Regression models were used to identify the factors associated with anxiety and depression. Results: The proportion of participants with clinical anxiety was 11.8 \% and clinical depression 13.8 \% . More anxiety and depression were associated with poorer vision-related quality of life and greater levels of appearance concerns. Younger age was related to greater levels of anxiety. Less educated participants and those feeling more angry about losing an eye are more prone to experience depression. Clinical variables were unrelated to anxiety or depression. Conclusions: Anxiety and depression are more prevalent in eye-enucleated patients than the general population, which brings up the issues of psychiatric support in these patients.

Urease thus prepared has specific activity comparable with the highest value yet reported (44.5 +/- 1.47 kat/kg, Km = 3.32 +/- 0.05 mM; kcat. = 2.15 X 10(4) +/- 0.05 X 10(4)s-1 at pH7.0 and 38 degrees C). 3. Titration of the urease thiol groups with 2,2'-dipyridyl disulphide (2-Py-S-S-2-Py) and application of the method of Tsou Chen-Lu [(1962) Sci. Sin. 11, 1535-1558] suggests that the urease molecule (assumed to have mol.wt. 483000 and epsilon280 = 2.84 X 10(5) litre-mol-1-cm-1) contains 24 inessential thiol groups of relatively high reactivity (class-I), six 'essential' thiol groups of low reactivity (class-II) and 54 buried thiol groups (class-III) which are exposed in 6M-guanidinium chloride. 4. The reaction of the class-I thiol groups with 2-Py-S-S-2-Py was studied in the pH range 6-11 at 25 degrees C(I = 0.1 mol/l) by stopped-flow spectrophotometry, and the analogous reaction of the class-II thiol groups by conventional spectrophotometry. 5. The class-I thiol groups consist of at least two sub-classes whose reactions with 2-Py-S-S-2-Py are characterized by (a) pKa = 9.1, k = 1.56 X 10(4)M-1-s-1 and (b) pKa = 8.1, k = 8.05 X 10(2)M-1-s-1 respectively. The reaction of the class-II thiol groups is characterized by pKa = 9.15 and k = 1.60 X 10(2)M-1-s-1. 6. At pH values 7-8 the class-I thiol groups consist of approx. 50% class-Ia groups and 50% class-Ib groups. The ratio class Ia/class Ib decreases an or equal to approx. 9.5, and at high pH the class-I thiol groups consist of at most 25% class-Ia groups and at least 75% class-Ib groups. 7. The reactivity of the class-II thiol groups towards 2-Py-S-S-2-Py is insensitive to the nature of the group used to block the class-I thiols. 8. All the 'essential' thiol groups in urease appear to be eeactive only as uncomplicated thiolate ions. The implications of this for the active-centre chemistry of urease relative to that of the thiol proteinases are discussed.",1997.0,10.1042/bj1590245,N3ZQ94EI,0,personality,1590

The treatment program lasted 6h each day and was delivered by two experienced therapists. Patients received core components of panic treatment, including psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, and interoceptive exposure. The interoceptive exposure exercises directly targeted anxiety sensitivity, a psychological construct also implicated in the maintenance of PTSD. Eighty-nine percent of patients who expressed interest in the treatment attended a baseline evaluation, and 63 \% of those who were study eligible initiated treatment. Treatment retention was high, with all 10 patients who initiated treatment completing the program.

1596,MBSR in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients With Controlled Disease But Persistent Depressive Symptoms,Nct,"Despite their efficacy at controlling joint inflammation, current treatments of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) leave up to 40% of patients into non‐remission. Non‐remission is most frequently due to persistently negative self‐reported global impact of RA, and not to remaining swollen joints or elevated levels of acute phase reactants. In a cohort of recent‐onset RA patients diagnosed early and treated to remission (Sherbrooke Early Undifferentiated PolyArthritis (EUPA) cohort), treatment of active disease rapidly led to reduced depressive symptoms in most, but 20% still expressed elevated depressive symptoms (using the CES‐D screening tool) after a mean of 7 months. Elevated CES‐D scores at this early time strongly predicted never reaching remission over the following 4 years. Elevated CES‐D scores were strongly correlated with increased levels of patient‐related outcomes (PROs such as fatigue, pain, sleep quality, stiffness and functional limitation), but not with joint or systemic inflammation. In fact, 80% of patients expressing depressive symptoms had controlled joint disease at the same visit. The investigators propose that addressing depressive symptoms will improve RA patients' symptoms and quality of life. In clinical practice, the best indicator of depressive symptoms is the presence of a disconnect between the Patient's (Pt‐VAS) and the Physician's (MD‐VAS) evaluation of disease activity in patients without objective signs of inflammation. This pilot study will explore the feasibility and acceptability of testing MBSR in these patients. It will assess over 6 months the changes in depressive symptoms and PROs both in controls and MBSR‐treated patients. If positive, the investigators plan to complete a multicenter 6‐month Randomized Clinical trial (RCT) (with a 2 year follow up) to formally address the risks/benefits of group MBSR interventions in RA patients with controlled inflammatory disease but positive disconnect between Pt‐VAS and MD‐VAS.",2017.0,,NLD8MAC9,0,additional,1597
1597,"Tracking the Trajectory of Shame, Guilt, and Pride Across the Life Span","Orth, U.; Robins, R. W.; Soto, C. J.","The authors examined age differences in shame, guilt, and 2 forms of pride (authentic and hubristic) from age 13 years to age 89 years, using cross-sectional data from 2,611 individuals. Shame decreased from adolescence into middle adulthood, reaching a nadir around age 50 years, and then increased in old age. Guilt increased from adolescence into old age, reaching a plateau at about age 70 years. Authentic pride increased from adolescence into old age, whereas hubristic pride decreased from adolescence into middle adulthood, reaching a minimum around age 65 years, and then increased in old age. On average, women reported experiencing more shame and guilt; Blacks reported experiencing less shame and Asians more hubristic pride than other ethnicities. Across the life span, shame and hubristic pride tended to be negatively related to psychological well-being, and shame-free guilt and authentic pride showed positive relations with well-being. Overall, the findings support the maturity principle of personality development and suggest that as people age they become more prone to experiencing psychologically adaptive self-conscious emotions, such as guilt and authentic pride, and less prone to experiencing psychologically maladaptive ones, such as shame and hubristic pride. \textcopyright 2010 American Psychological Association.",2010.0,,RZW6CZ6Y,0,psychodynamic,1598
1598,"The progress of anxiety, mood, and psychotic symptoms during undergraduate education",Ko,"Objective: The basic aim of the study is to determine the outcome of anxiety (somatization, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, and phobic anxiety), mood (interpersonal sensitivity, depression, and hostility) and psychotic symptoms (paranoid ideation and psychoticism) during undergraduate education. In this context, the effect of under graduate education on psychological symptoms has been tested. Another aim of the study is to determine which psychological symptom or symptoms occur mostly in this period. Methods: The temporal change in the psychological symptoms of same people was aimed to be determined. In order to reach this aim the study was planned as a 'longitudinal study' which is one type of scanning research. Data had been collected by Symptom Check List-90-R. Study had been conducted on 120 volunteer students. Results: Anxiety, mood and psychotic symptoms gradually increase at undergraduate 1st, 2nd and 3rd grade and decrease at 4th grade. Anxiety, mood and psychotic symptoms increase at 3rd grade mostly. Psychological symptoms which occur mostly at 3rd grade respectively are: obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, paranoid ideation, anxiety, psychoticism, somatization and hostility. Phobic anxiety had not been found at any grade level. Conclusion: Psychological symptoms draw the shape of a convex graph during undergraduate education. Third grade is the peak point of the graph.",2013.0,,FRIY68AL,0,personality,1599
1599,Hyperprolactinaemia as a result of immaturity or regression: The concept of maternal subroutine. A new model of psychoendocrine interactions,"Sobrinho, L. G.; Almeida-Costa, J. M.","Pathological hyperprolactinaemia (PH) is significantly associated with: (1) paternal deprivation during childhood, (2) depression, (3) non-specific symptoms including obesity and weight gain. The clinical onset of the symptoms often follows pregnancy or a loss. Prolactin is an insulin antagonist which does not promote weight gain. Hyperprolactinaemia and increased metabolic efficiency are parts of a system of interdependent behavioural and metabolic mechanisms necessary for the care of the young. We call this system, which is available as a whole package, maternal subroutine (MS). An important number of cases of PH are due to activation of the MS that is not induced by pregnancy. The same occurs in surrogate maternity and in some animal models. Most women with PH developed a malignant symbiotic relationship with their mothers in the setting of absence, alcoholism or devaluation of the father. These women may regress to early developmental stages to the point that they identify themselves both with their lactating mother and with the nursing infant as has been found in psychoanalysed patients and in the paradigmatic condition of pseudopregnancy. Such regression can be associated with activation of the MS. Prolactinomas represent the extreme of the spectrum of PH and may result from somatic mutations occurring in hyperstimulated lactotrophs.",1992.0,,C3KSSA8S,0,psychodynamic,1600
1600,The manipulation of arousal on the intensity of urges to pull hair in a 16 year old female with trichotillomania: A single case study,"Drysdale, E.; Jahoda, A.; Campbell, E.","Hairpulling (trichotillomania) is often linked to stressful circumstances and may produce feelings of guilt, shame and humiliation. In a behavioural model, affective experience was identified as an important maintaining factor, as both a cue and reinforcer. Habit Reversal is one of the more successful behavioural treatment options. The present study evaluated the role of emotional arousal in the intensity of urges to pull hair in a teenaged patient with trichotillomania. Using an experimental ABCD/DCBA reversal design, the patient used imagery to increase her emotional arousal through the presentation of a manipulation script based on her own experience, after baseline and during a rumination, cognitive and a behavioural distraction phase. Subjective measures of urge intensity were collected at five time points during completion of a task, and a tally was made of an overt hair touching behaviour operationalized as a hairpulling substitute behaviour. The patient experienced more intense urges to pull whilst ruminating on the arousal script compared to either of the distraction phases. The findings support the view that the experience of negative emotional arousal can exacerbate and intensify the experience of urges to pull hair in patients with trichotillomania, and that both cognitive and behavioural distraction techniques have some effect in controlling them. Demonstrating this to the patient aided engagement in treatment. \textcopyright 2008 British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies.",2009.0,,IQ9DQQPR,0,psychodynamic,1601
1601,STAIR narrative therapy: A skills focused approach to trauma-related distress,"Hassija, C. M.; Cloitre, M.","Interest in psychotherapeutic interventions for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) populations that address variants of commonly co-occurring trauma sequelae is emerging. Specifically, treatment approaches that enhance an individual's capacity to experience and successfully modulate emotion, function interpersonally, and access social support are of particular value. The present paper briefly describes emotional and social difficulties commonly experienced by trauma survivors and outlines potential targets for intervention within the context of trauma-focused treatment. Skills Training in Affective and Interpersonal Regulation (STAIR) Narrative Therapy is a skills-focused approach designed to foster the development and strengthening of emotion regulation and interpersonal skills and promote resilience. Empirical evidence supporting the efficacy of STAIR Narrative Therapy as an effective treatment for PTSD as well as emotion regulation and social difficulties is reviewed. Implications for treatment and directions for future research are presented.",2015.0,,UXGJCASN,0,cognitive_additional,1602
